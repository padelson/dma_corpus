Section 2.01 _Services; Scope_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, (i)
BarCap shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the LBHI Entities those
services (the " _BarCap Services_ ") that were being provided (x) by any
Subsidiary of LBHI that is acquired by BarCap or one of its Affiliates
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or a vendor of such Subsidiary, or (y) by
the LBHI Entities or a vendor thereof through the use of the Purchased Assets
or the Transferred Employees, to the IMD Business and any other businesses of
the LBHI Entities prior to the Closing that were not acquired by BarCap under
the Purchase Agreement (each such business, a " _Retained LBHI Business_ "),
and (ii) LBHI shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the BarCap Entities
those services that were being provided by an LBHI Entity or a vendor thereof
prior to the Closing to the businesses acquired by BarCap under the Purchase
Agreement (the " _LBHI Services_ " and collectively with the BarCap Services,
the " _Services_ "). If, for any reason, BarCap is unable to provide any
BarCap Service to the LBHI Entities pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
BarCap shall provide to the applicable LBHI Entity a substantially equivalent
service (a " _BarCap Substitute Service_ ") in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, which such service shall be considered a BarCap Service for
purposes of this Agreement.  The scope of each BarCap Service shall be
substantially the same as the scope of such services provided by the
applicable LBHI Entity to the applicable Retained LBHI Business in the
ordinary course during the Benchmark Period (in each case, to the extent such
BarCap Service was provided using Purchased Assets or by Transferred
Employees), and the use of each BarCap Service by an LBHI Entity shall
include use by such LBHI Entitys contractors in substantially the same
manner as used by such contractors in the ordinary course, during the
Benchmark Period. If, for any reason, an LBHI Entity is unable to provide any
LBHI Service to the BarCap Entities pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
LBHI shall provide to the applicable BarCap Entity a substantially equivalent
service (an " _LBHI Substitute Service_ ") in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, which such service shall be considered an LBHI Service for
purposes of this Agreement. The scope of each LBHI Service shall be
substantially the same as the scope of such service provided by the
applicable Retained LBHI Business to the applicable LBHI Entity in
the ordinary course during the Benchmark Period, and the use of each LBHI
Service by a BarCap Entity shall include use by such BarCap Entitys
contractors in substantially the same manner as used by such contractors in
the ordinary course, during the Benchmark Period. All Services shall be for
the sole use and benefit of the respective Recipient, including any of such
Recipients customers or clients of the type who received the use and benefit
of the equivalent services in the ordinary course during the Benchmark
Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Recipient agrees that it shall not
re-market or act as a service provider with respect to any of the Services
hereunder to a third party.

  



  

(b) Each Service shall include, and the Service Charges reflect charges for,
such maintenance, support, error correction, updates and enhancements
normally and customarily provided by the relevant Provider to its
subsidiaries that receive such service. Each Service shall include
all functions, responsibilities, activities and tasks, and the
materials, documentation, resources, rights and licenses to be used, granted
or provided by the relevant

  



        
   

  



  

Provider that are not specifically described in this Agreement as a part of
such Service, but are incidental to, and would normally be considered an
inherent part of, or necessary subpart included within, such Service or are
otherwise necessary for such Provider to provide, or the Recipient to
receive, such Service.

  



  

(c) Throughout the term of this Agreement, (i) each Provider and each
Recipient of any Service shall cooperate with one another and use their good
faith and commercially reasonable efforts to effect the efficient, timely and
seamless provision and receipt of such Service and (ii) the Recipient shall
use its good faith and commercially reasonable efforts to transition away and
wind down its use of the Services.

  



  

(d) This Agreement shall not assign any rights to Technology or Intellectual
Property between the parties hereto.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for the avoidance of
doubt, Lehman Brothers Holdings plc, Lehman Brothers Limited, LB UK RE
Holdings Limited and Lehman Brothers International (Europe) shall not be
deemed LBHI Entities hereunder.

  



  

Section 2.02 _Conversion Services_.

  



  

(a) During the term of this Agreement, the parties shall provide, or cause to
be provided, the following information and support to the other party, as
applicable, which support shall be included within the Services described
herein or in the Schedules hereto:

  



  

(i) current and reasonably available historical data owned by the Provider
and related to the Services and predecessor services thereto as reasonably
required by the relevant Recipient in connection with the conduct of the
Business (in the case of BarCap) or the Retained LBHI Business (in the case
of the LBHI Entities) or for litigation or regulatory purposes, in a manner
and within a time period as mutually agreed by the parties; and

  



  

(ii) on commercially reasonable terms, which will be added to the Service
Charges, the services of the employees and contractors of the relevant
Provider whose assistance, expertise or presence is necessary to assist the
Recipients transition team in establishing a fully functioning stand-alone
environment (it being understood that the services of employees and
contractors pursuant to this clause (ii) are not intended to be a substitute
for the services of its own employees and third party consultants and
advisors to be engaged by the relevant Recipient in connection with such
transition or similar services, but instead to facilitate coordination with
such individuals).

  



  

Section 2.03 _Transition Services Managers_.

  



  

(a) BarCap shall appoint an individual, by giving written notice thereof to
LBHI within three Business Days following the date hereof, to act as its
initial services manager (the " _BarCap Services Manager_ "), who will be
directly responsible for coordinating and managing the delivery of the BarCap
Services and have authority to act on BarCaps behalf with respect to matters
relating to this Agreement. The BarCap Services Manager will work with the
personnel of BarCap to periodically address issues and matters raised by LBHI
relating to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the requirements of _Section
9.05_, all communications from LBHI

  



        
   

  



  

to BarCap pursuant to this Agreement regarding routine matters involving the
BarCap Services shall be made through the BarCap Services Manager, or such
other individual as specified by the BarCap Services Manager in writing and
delivered to LBHI by email or facsimile transmission with receipt confirmed.
BarCap shall reasonably promptly notify LBHI of the appointment of a
different BarCap Services Manager, if necessary, in accordance with _Section
9.05_.

  



  

(b) LBHI shall appoint an individual, by giving written notice thereof to
BarCap within three Business Days following the date hereof, to act as its
initial services manager (the " _LBHI Services Manager_ "), who will be
directly responsible for coordinating and managing the delivery of the LBHI
Services and have authority to act on LBHIs behalf with respect to matters
relating to this Agreement. The LBHI Services Manager will work with the
personnel of LBHI to periodically address issues and matters raised by BarCap
relating to this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the requirements of _Section
9.05_, all communications from BarCap to LBHI pursuant to this Agreement
regarding routine matters involving the Services shall be made through the
LBHI Services Manager, or such other individual as specified by the LBHI
Services Manager in writing and delivered to BarCap by email or facsimile
transmission with receipt confirmed. LBHI shall reasonably promptly notify
BarCap of the appointment of a different LBHI Services Manager, if necessary,
in accordance with _Section 9.05_.

  



  

Section 2.04 _Personnel; Authorized Signatories_. The Provider will have the
right, in its sole discretion, to (i) designate which personnel or third
party service providers it will assign to perform Services, and (ii) remove
and replace such personnel or third party service providers at any time.

  



  

Section 2.05 _Performance and Receipt of Services_. The following provisions
shall apply to the Services:

  



  

(a) _Security and Privacy_. Each Provider and Recipient shall at all times
comply with its own then in-force security guidelines and policies applicable
to the performance, access and/or use of the Services and Information
Systems. Where a Provider or Recipient receives access to the other partys
Information Systems, then it shall also comply with such other partys
security guidelines and policies. The parties acknowledge that historically
the Services governed by this Agreement have been rendered within a single
group of related entities and a shared security environment, and that in
order for Services to be rendered among and between the BarCap Entities and
the LBHI Entities as unrelated entities additional systems, procedures,
guidelines and policies may need to be established to render the Services in
compliance with Law, regulation, and applicable privacy and security
policies. Each of the LBHI Entities and the BarCap Entities shall use its
reasonable efforts to establish such additional systems, procedures,
guidelines and policies in a manner that will not disrupt the rendering of
Services or the LBHI Retained Businesses or the Business, respectively.
Recipient shall bear all of its own costs and expenses in connection with
such an effort; Providers costs and expenses in connection with such an
effort will be included in the Service Charges to the extent directly related
to providing the Services.

  



  

(b) _No Viruses_. Each of LBHI and BarCap shall take commercially reasonable
measures to ensure that no Viruses or similar items are coded or introduced
into the Services or Information Systems. If a Virus is found to have been
introduced into the Services or

  



        
   

  



  

Information Systems, the parties hereto shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate and to diligently work together to eliminate
the effects of such Virus.

  



  

(c) _Reasonable Care_. Each Provider and Recipient shall exercise reasonable
care in providing and receiving the Services to (i) prevent access to the
Services or Information Systems by unauthorized Persons and (ii) not damage,
disrupt or interrupt the Services or Information Systems.

  



  

Section 2.06 _Termination Services_. Each Provider shall reasonably
cooperate with the Recipient of each Service, upon request and
on commercially reasonable terms (which will be added to the Service
Charges), to facilitate such Recipients transition to provision of such
services by a replacement provider or by its own employees.

  



  

Section 2.07 _Superseding Provisions_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement:

  



  

(a) no Provider shall be required hereunder to take any action (including by
providing any Services) that would constitute, or that the Provider
reasonably believes would constitute, (i) a violation of applicable Law,
including any requirement of any Governmental Body, (ii) a breach of such
Providers contractual obligations or (iii) any other violation of a third
partys rights; provided that in each of the foregoing circumstances the
Provider shall use reasonable efforts to work around the impediment and
endeavor to provide Services in a manner that does not violate Law,
contractual obligations or third party rights;

  



  

(b) no Provider shall be required hereunder to fund the Services or otherwise
provide financial support, benefits or other consideration on the Recipients
behalf to third parties, or to take custody of, settle, clear or handle
securities, in connection with the Services, and the obligation to perform
any Service involving funds shall be subject to the Recipient having
previously made such funds available to the Provider specifically for such
purpose;

  



  

(c) any obligation to provide Services or otherwise undertake activities
hereunder shall be limited to the partys use of good faith and commercially
reasonable efforts; and

  



  

(d) the Provider shall not be responsible for any failure to provide Services
hereunder to the extent arising from (i) the Recipients operations or
systems or otherwise by the acts or omissions of the Recipient or individuals
acting on its behalf or (ii) a third partys failure to provide such Services
or (iii) the failure of Recipient or its Affiliates to provide Services to
Provider.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 3 
  
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS AND ARRANGEMENTS**

  

 ** **

  

Section 3.01 _Computer-Based Resources_. Commencing on the Closing Date, and
for ninety (90) days thereafter, each party (the " _Accessing Party_ ") shall
continue to have access to the Information Systems of the other party (the "
_Providing Party_ "), to the extent such access to such Information Systems
was available to the Accessing Party immediately prior to

  



        
   

  



  

the Closing and remains necessary for the Accessing Party to operate its
business; _provided_ , that (a) the BarCap Entities may take reasonable
measures to restrict access by the LBHI Entities to any systems or data
unrelated to the Retained LBHI Business to which the LBHI Entities are not
entitled to access, (b) the LBHI Entities may take reasonable measures to
restrict access by the BarCap Entities, to any systems or data unrelated to
the Business to which the BarCap Entities are not entitled to access, and (c)
such continued access shall be subject to the Accessing Party complying with
all reasonable security measures implemented by the Providing Party as deemed
necessary by such Providing Party to protect its Information Systems.
Commencing no later than ten Business Days after the Closing Date,
representatives of BarCap and LBHI with authority in the area of Information
Systems (the " _IT Committee_ ") shall meet at such reasonable time, place
and manner as they may agree, to develop a plan for migrating from the
Information System infrastructure as deployed as of the Closing Date, to a
final Information Systems infrastructure satisfactory to both BarCap and LBHI
(the " _IT Migration Plan_ "). The parties shall use reasonable efforts
to enter into an IT Migration Plan no later than one month after the Closing
Date and shall include, among other provisions, a time line for completing
the migration of Information Services and a final migration deadline
after which neither BarCap nor any LBHI Entity shall have access to all or
any part of the Information Systems of the other party, except to the extent
reasonably necessary for the receipt of the Services (subject to the
accessing party complying with all reasonable security measures implemented
by the providing party as deemed necessary by such providing party to protect
its Information Systems), or as otherwise agreed in a separate agreement.
When finalized in writing and executed by the authorized representatives of
BarCap and the LBHI Entities, the IT Migration Plan shall be deemed to be
incorporated into this Agreement as an amendment and addition hereto.

  



  

Section 3.02 _Termination of Support_. BarCap shall provide the IMD Entities
with notice a reasonable period in advance of ceasing to support any material
software contained within the Purchased Assets that directly supports the IMD
Business. Following receipt of such notice, if the IMD Entities so elect in
writing, BarCap shall use reasonable efforts provide the IMD Entities with a
copy of such software in source code and object code form and any associated
documentation for their use pursuant to Section 8.9 of the Purchase
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that following such receipt, the IMD
Entities shall endeavor to support their own services through the use of such
software and if the IMD Entities are successful in doing so, then BarCap
shall no longer be obligated to provide the Service to the extent previously
supported by such software.

  



  

Section 3.03 _Point System_. Until the earlier of the first anniversary of
the Closing Date and the date on which BarCap and the relevant IMD Entity
enter into an arms length agreement on mutually agreeable terms, the IMD
Entities will have the option to become "enterprise level" clients at
prevailing market rates of the Point System application/service.

  



  

Section 3.04 _Access_. BarCap or LBHI, as the case may be, will allow the
relevant Provider and its Representatives reasonable access to the facilities
and personnel of the relevant Recipient, and shall provide such other
reasonable cooperation and assistance, at the Recipients cost, necessary for
the performance of the Services for the Provider to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement.

  



         
 

  



  

Section 3.05 _Schedules_. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Services
contemplated to be provided hereunder are not enumerated, defined or
described in detail. For purposes of illustration, the Services may include
(or include aspects of) operational, financial, corporate, human resources,
information technology and other services. The parties shall cooperate in good
faith to create Schedules to this Agreement, within thirty days following the
Closing Date, that will contain a specific list of certain of the Services to
be provided pursuant hereto, including, with respect to the IMD
Business, potential additional specificity on the pricing model. For the
avoidance of doubt, but subject to Section 3.07, none of the Services shall
require the relevant Provider to provide the legal services of any attorney
to the Recipient in connection with any such Service (unless otherwise agreed
in writing by the parties hereto).

  



  

Section 3.06 _Assignment of Shared Purchased Contracts_. With respect to
Purchased Contracts that relate both to (i) the business acquired by BarCap
under the Purchase Agreement and (ii) Retained LBHI Businesses (" _Shared
Purchased Contracts_ "):

  



  

(a) where BarCap has the contractual right to assign the portion of its
rights under such agreements that relate to any of the Retained LBHI
Businesses (while retaining the portion of such rights that relate to the
Business), with no additional payment to the counterparty thereof, it shall
exercise such right. If BarCap has the contractual right to make such partial
assignment but only upon payment to the counterparty thereof, it shall notify
LBHI of the amount of the required payment and shall exercise such right upon
receipt of payment by LBHI of the amount required to be paid to
the counterparty; and

  



  

(b) where BarCap does not have the contractual right to assign the portion of
its rights under such agreements, BarCap shall cooperate in good faith with
LBHI in LBHIs efforts to enter into a replacement agreement on comparable
terms; _provided_ that BarCap shall have no obligation to pay anything of
value  with respect to such cooperation; and

  



  

(c) the recipient of such partial assignment or counterparty to such
replacement agreement shall be, as applicable, LBHI or the assignee of the
relevant Retained LBHI Business.

  



  

Section 3.07 _Further Access_.

  



  

(a) For a period of two years after the Closing Date, the BarCap Entities
shall provide, or use reasonable efforts to cause to be provided to, the LBHI
Entities at no charge (other than BarCaps out-of-pocket costs and expenses
including contractor fees) with reasonable access to all individuals who were
employees or contractors of the LBHI Entities prior to the Closing Date (and
are employees or contractors of the BarCap Entities at the time of requested
access), and who have material knowledge about the Retained LBHI Businesses
or the Excluded Liabilities, and BarCap shall use reasonable efforts to
provide such individuals cooperation therewith. As part of the foregoing,
for a period of ninety (90) days after the Closing, (i) such employees shall
provide reasonably necessary assistance to the LBHI Entities in the unwinding
of the Retained LBHI Business and (ii) such employees that are attorneys
shall provide reasonably necessary legal services in the unwinding of the
Retained LBHI Business, provided that such assistance in (i) and (ii) shall
be deemed Services as to which the Service Charges

  



        
   

  



  

apply and in all instances shall be subject to any confidentiality,
professional or ethical obligations or restrictions (including without
limitation any potential conflicts).

  



  

(b) For a period of two years after the Closing Date, the LBHI Entities shall
provide, or use reasonable efforts to cause to be provided to, the BarCap
Entities at no charge (other than LBHIs out-of-pocket costs and expenses
including contractor fees) with reasonable access to all individuals who were
employees or contractors of the LBHI Entities prior to the Closing Date (and
are employees or contractors of the LBHI Entities at the time of requested
access), and who have material knowledge about the Business or the Services
to be provided by the BarCap Entities, and LBHI shall use reasonable efforts
to provide such individuals cooperation therewith.

  



  

(c) The parties recognize and understand that there will be substantial
efforts in the period following the Closing Date in the integration of the
Transferred Employees and the Purchased Assets into BarCaps operations and
the operation of the Business, and the continuing efforts of LBHI to divest
the remaining assets and wind down the Retained LBHI Business while
maintaining the continuity thereof. As such, the parties will work together
to reasonably accommodate each other in such efforts while balancing
BarCaps needs for integration and operation with LBHIs needs for
information and support.

  



  

Section 3.08 _Data Centers_. To the extent BarCap is assuming material data
center contracts as part of the Purchased Assets, the parties will negotiate
in good faith a post-Closing data center strategy to reasonably address such
issues as part of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.09 _IMD Employees_. During the thirty-day period following the
Closing Date, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to develop a
reasonable procedure (a) pursuant to which BarCap will endeavor to provide
notice to LBHI prior to terminating the employment of any Transferred
Employees during the six months following the Closing Date who are dedicated
(or primarily dedicated) to the IMD Business, to the extent permitted under
applicable confidentiality and privacy obligations and (b) to identify any
Transferred Employees whose functions prior to the Closing Date were
unrelated to the Business (if any).

  



  

Section 3.10 _Notices_. If any of the LBHI Entities receive any notices
related to the Business it shall promptly forward them to BarCap and if any
of the BarCap Entities receive any notices related to the Retained LBHI
Businesses it shall promptly forward them to LBHI.

  



  

Section 3.11 _Software_. For a period of ninety days following the Closing
Date, upon the request of LBHI, the parties will cooperate in good faith to
identify any software included in the Purchased Assets for which there is no
third party vendor or service provider that can reasonably provide comparable
software and the absence of which would cause a material adverse effect on
the value of the relevant underlying business operations or assets of the
Retained LBHI Businesses. The BarCap Entities will use reasonable efforts to
provide a copy of such software to LBHI (in source code and object form and
associated documents, to the extent in their reasonable possession); provided
that such software shall be governed by the scope of the license in Section
8.9(b) of the Purchase Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 3.12. _Access to Books and Records_. (a) The BarCap Entities shall
provide the LBHI Entities reasonable access to books and records acquired as
part of the Purchased Assets that are related and material to the Retained
LBHI Business (to the extent such books and records are in a BarCap Entitys
possession at the time of requested access); and (b) the LBHI Entities shall
provide the BarCap Entities reasonable access to books and records that are
related and material to the Business (to the extent such books and records
are in an LBHI Entitys possession at the time of requested access).

  



  

 **ARTICLE 4 

**

  

 **COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS; PAYMENTS**

  

 ** **

  

Section 4.01 _Costs and Disbursements; Payments_.

  



  

(a) Any Service to be provided by any Provider hereunder shall be charged to
the Recipient thereof as follows (such charges, the " _Service Charges_ "):

  



  

(i) until the date that is nine (9) months after the Closing Date, at a cost
equal to the Providers fully-loaded costs and expenses for providing such
Service (including in such fully-loaded costs and expenses (x) an allocation
for overhead costs to the extent directly related to providing the Services,
(y) the amount of the actual payments made by the Provider to third-party
providers for providing Services, and (z) associated overhead costs relating
to the Services provided by such third-party providers) (" _Provider s
Cost_"), but without any markup for profit margin; and

  



  

(ii) on and after the date that is nine (9) months after the Closing Date
(including during any extension of the term of this Agreement), at a cost
equal to Providers Cost plus 15% of Providers Cost.

  



  

Service Charges shall include value-added taxes and all other taxes payable
in respect of the provision of the Services other than taxes imposed on the
net income of the Provider. If LBHI or BarCap (as applicable) is required,
by Law or to otherwise avoid legal penalties under Law, to pay, directly or
indirectly, to an Affiliate any transfer pricing markup or equivalent cost in
order to deliver a Service, then such transfer pricing markup or cost shall
be included in the relevant Service Charges, unless such mark-up or cost is
subsequently recoverable by LBHI or BarCap (as applicable).

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, Service Charges shall not include any amounts
owed by a party (whether to third parties or Affiliates) prior to the Closing
Date.

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, Service Charges may increase or decrease,
including, as a result of (i) an increase or decrease in the amount of such
Services being provided to the Recipient (as compared to the amount of the
Services underlying the determination of a Service Charge), (ii) an increase
or decrease in the rates or charges imposed by any third-party provider that
is providing goods or services used by the Provider in providing the Services
(as compared to the rates or charges underlying a Service Charge), (iii)
an increase or decrease in the payroll or benefits for any employees used by
the Provider in providing the Services, or (iv) any increase or decrease
in costs relating to any changes requested by the Recipient in the nature of
the Services

  



        
   

  



  

provided (including relating to newly installed products or equipment or any
upgrades to existing products or equipment).

  



  

(b) The Provider shall deliver an invoice to the Recipient on a monthly basis
(or, at the option of the Provider, at such other frequency as is consistent
with the basis on which the Service Charges are determined and, if
applicable, charged to Affiliates of the Provider) in arrears for the Service
Charges due to the Provider under this Agreement. The Recipient shall pay the
amount of such invoice by wire transfer or check to the Provider within
thirty (30) days of the date of such invoice as instructed by the Provider;
_provided_ that to the extent consistent with past practice with respect to
Services rendered outside the United States, payments may be made in local
currency. If the Recipient fails to pay such amount by such date, the
Recipient shall be obligated to pay to the Provider, in addition to the
amount due, interest at an interest rate of 1-1/2% per month over the Prime
Rate, compounded monthly, accruing from the date the payment was due through
the date of actual payment. As soon as practicable after receipt of any
reasonable written request by the Recipient, the Provider shall provide the
Recipient with data and documentation reasonably satisfactory to the
Recipient supporting the calculation of a particular Service Charge for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of such calculation. If, after reviewing
such data and documentation, the Recipient disputes the Providers
calculation of any amount due to the Provider, then the dispute shall be
resolved pursuant to _Section 7.01_.

  



  

Section 4.02 _No Right to Set-Off_. The Recipient shall pay the full amount
of costs and disbursements incurred under this Agreement, and shall not set-
off, counterclaim or otherwise withhold any other amount owed to the Provider
on account of any obligation owed by the Provider to the Recipient.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 5 

**

  

 **STANDARD FOR SERVICE; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS**

  

 ** **

  

Section 5.01 _Standard for Service_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Provider agrees to perform the Services such that the
nature, quality, standard of care and the service levels at which such
Services are performed are no less than the nature, quality, standard of care
and service levels at which the substantially same services were performed by
or on behalf of the Provider prior to the Closing Date in the ordinary course
of business during the Benchmark Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Provider shall have no liability hereunder
for any Losses incurred by the Recipient except to the extent arising from
Providers gross negligence or willful misconduct (and in any case subject to
the limitations set forth in Article 6).

  



  

Section 5.02 _Disclaimer of Warranties_.  Except as expressly set forth
herein, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Services are
provided as-is, that the applicable Recipient assumes all risks and
liabilities arising from or relating to its use of and reliance upon the
Services and each Provider makes no representation or warranty with respect
thereto. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, THE PROVIDERS HEREBY EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SERVICES, WHETHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY IN REGARD TO
QUALITY, PERFORMANCE,

  



        
   

  



  

NONINFRINGEMENT, COMMERCIAL UTILITY, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS OF THE
SERVICES FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 6 

**

  

 **INDEMNIFICATION; LIMITATION ON LIABILITY**

  

 ** **

  

Section 6.01 _Indemnification of Each Provider by the Relevant Recipient_.
Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article VI_, each Recipient
shall indemnify and hold harmless each relevant Provider and its Affiliates
and Representatives (each, a " _Provider Indemnified Party_ ") from and
against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage or expense (including
legal fees and expenses) (" _Losses_ ") to the extent owed to third parties,
and reimburse each relevant Provider Indemnified Party for all expenses as
they are incurred, whether or not in connection with pending litigation and
whether or not any Provider Indemnified Party is a party, arising out of any
claim by a third party to the extent caused by, resulting from or in
connection with any of the Services rendered or to be rendered by or on
behalf of such Provider pursuant to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or such Providers actions or
inactions in connection with any such Services or transactions; _provided_
that such Recipient shall not be responsible for any Losses of such Provider
Indemnified Party to the extent that such Loss is caused by, results from, or
arises out of or in connection with a Provider Indemnified Partys gross
negligence or willful misconduct in connection with any such Services or
transactions, actions or inactions related thereto.

  



  

Section 6.02 _Limited Liability of a Provider_.  Notwithstanding _Article V_
or anything else to the contrary contained herein, no Provider Indemnified
Party shall have any liability in contract, tort or otherwise, for or in
connection with any Services rendered or to be rendered by any Provider
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any Provider Indemnified Partys actions or inactions in
connection with any such Services or transactions, to any Recipient
Indemnified Party, except to the extent that any such Recipient Indemnified
Party suffers a Loss that results from such Provider Indemnified Partys
gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with any such Services
or transactions, actions or inactions related thereto.

  



  

Section 6.03 _Limited Liability of a Recipient_.  Notwithstanding _Article
V_ or anything else to the contrary contained herein, no Recipient shall have
any liability in contract, tort or otherwise, for or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or such Recipients actions or
inactions in connection with any Services or transactions, to any Provider,
except (a) to the extent that any such Provider suffers a Loss that results
from such Recipients gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection
with any such transactions, actions or inactions related thereto or (b) to
the extent owed pursuant to Recipients indemnification obligations in
Section 6.01.

  



  

Section 6.04 _Additional Limitation on Liability_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, no
Provider Indemnified Party shall be liable for any exemplary, special,
indirect, punitive,

  



        
   

  



  

incidental or consequential losses, damages or expenses, including any
damages due to business interruption or loss of profits.

  



  

(b) Except for the indemnification obligations set forth in Section 6.01, the
aggregate liability and indemnification of each of BarCap and LBHI (or their
respective assignees in accordance with _Section 9.10_) with respect to this
Agreement shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the aggregate amount of Service
Charges paid hereunder to BarCap or LBHI (or such respective assignees), as
the case may be.

  



  

Section 6.05 _Liability for Payment Obligations_.  Nothing in this _Article
VI_ shall be deemed to eliminate or limit, in any respect, a partys express
obligation in this Agreement to pay or reimburse, as applicable, for (i)
Termination Charges, (ii) Service Charges for Services rendered in accordance
with this Agreement, (iii) amounts in respect of conversion services provided
pursuant to _Section 2.02_, or (iv) other costs and expenses to the extent
expressly provided herein.

  



  

Section 6.06 _Obligations Several and Not Joint_.  As between a Recipient and
a permitted third-party assignee of the Recipient, the obligations of each
such party under this Agreement shall be several and not joint.

  



  

Section 6.07 THE DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND OVERALL
ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS
OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES.  THE PROVIDER WOULD NOT BE ABLE OR
WILLING TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES WITHOUT THE PROTECTIONS PROVIDED TO PROVIDER
PURSUANT TO SUCH PROVISIONS. IF ANY APPLICABLE COURT HOLDS ANY
DISCLAIMER, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OR ALLOCATION OF RISK CONTAINED IN THIS
SECTION TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN A PARTYS LABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE
FULLEST POSSIBLE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 7 

**

  

 **DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

  

 ** **

  

Section 7.01 _Dispute Resolution_.

  



  

(a) In the event of any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the validity,
interpretation, breach or termination of any provision of this Agreement, or
calculation or allocation of the costs of any Service, including claims
seeking redress or asserting rights under any Law (each, a " _Dispute_ "),
the parties hereto agree that the BarCap Services Manager and LBHI Services
Manager (or such other Persons as BarCap and LBHI may designate) shall
negotiate in good faith in an attempt to resolve such Dispute amicably. If
such Dispute has not been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of BarCap and
LBHI within sixty (60) days after the initial notice of the Dispute (or such
longer period as such parties may agree), then, a senior executive on behalf
of BarCap and a senior executive on behalf of LBHI shall negotiate in good
faith in an attempt to resolve such Dispute amicably for an additional twenty
(20) days (or such longer period as such parties may agree). If

  



        
   

  



  

such Dispute has not been finally resolved at the end of such twenty-day
period, then either party may pursue remedies in accordance with _Section
9.11_.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Provider shall have no obligation
to comply with this _Section 7.01(a) _before exercising any rights or
remedies it may have under this Agreement.

  



  

(b) In any Dispute regarding the amount of a Service Charge, if after such
Dispute is finally adjudicated pursuant to the dispute resolution and/or
judicial process set forth in _Section 7.01(a) _or  _Section 9.11_, it is
determined that the Service Charge that the Provider has invoiced the
Recipient, and that the Recipient has paid to the Provider, is greater or
less than the amount that the Service Charge should have been, then (i) if it
is determined that the Recipient has overpaid the Service Charge, the
Provider shall within five (5) Business Days after such determination
reimburse the Recipient an amount of cash equal to such overpayment, plus
1-1/2% per month over the Prime Rate, compounded monthly, accruing from the
date of payment by the Recipient to the time of reimbursement by the Provider
and (ii) if it is determined that the Recipient has underpaid the Service
Charge, the Recipient shall within five (5) Business Days after such
determination reimburse the Provider an amount of cash equal to such
underpayment, plus 1-1/2% per month over the Prime Rate, compounded monthly,
accruing from the date such payment originally should have been made by the
Recipient to the time of reimbursement by the Recipient.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 8 

**

  

 **TERMINATION**

  

 ** **

  

Section 8.01 _Termination_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall commence immediately upon the Closing Date and shall
terminate as to any particular Service upon the earliest to occur of (i) the
first date on which the applicable party has no further need to have such
Service provided by the applicable Provider or (ii) the mutual written
agreement of the parties to terminate this Agreement in its entirety or (iii)
as further set out below. All Services shall terminate no later than the
earliest of (x) eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date and (y)
twelve (12) months from the closing date of the sale of the Retained LBHI
Business or portion of the Business, as applicable, to which such Service
relates or from which the Service is provided and (z) such date as Recipient
has developed an alternative source of such Services; _provided_ , that if
there is no third party vendor or service provider that can reasonably
provide a comparable Service, and the absence of such Service would cause a
material adverse effect on the value of the relevant underlying business
operations or assets, then, upon written notice from Recipient at least sixty
(60) days prior to the twelve month anniversary of the Closing Date, such
services shall be extended until the earliest of: (1) thirty (30) months
following the Closing Date; (2) twenty-four (24) months from the closing date
of the sale of the Retained LBHI Business or portion of the Business, as
applicable, to which such Service relates or from which the Service is
provided and (3) such date as Recipient has developed an alternative source
of such Services.  This Agreement shall terminate once the provision of
Services hereunder has terminated, and, for the avoidance of doubt, this
Agreement shall terminate at the end of the time periods set forth above.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) The Retained LBHI Businesses will use reasonable efforts to alter their
operations to minimize or eliminate the need for BarCap Services (including
by obtaining replacement services from a third party provider) as promptly as
reasonably practicable as they wind down their operations or dispose of them
to a third party. In addition, (i) a Recipient may from time to time
terminate this Agreement with respect to any particular Service, in whole but
not in part (1) for any reason or no reason upon providing at least thirty
(30) days prior written notice to the Provider of such termination, subject
to the obligation to pay Termination Charges, as provided for under _Section
8.02_, (2) if the Provider of such Service has failed to perform any of its
material obligations under this Agreement with respect to such Service, and
such failure shall continue to exist thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Provider of written notice of such failure from the Recipient, or (3)
immediately upon mutual written agreement of the parties hereto, and (ii) a
Provider may terminate this Agreement with respect to one or more Services,
in whole but not in part, at any time upon prior written notice to the
Recipient if the Recipient has failed to perform any of its material
obligations under this Agreement relating to such Service or Services, and
such failure shall be continued uncured for a period of thirty (30) days
after receipt by the Recipient of a written notice of such failure from the
Provider. In the event that the effective date of the termination of any
particular Service is a day other than at the end of a billing period, the
Service Charge associated with such Service shall be pro-rated appropriately.

  



  

(c) A Recipient may from time to time request a reduction in part of the
scope or amount of any particular Service. If requested to do so by Recipient,
the Provider agrees to discuss in good faith appropriate reductions to the
relevant Service Charges in light of all relevant factors including the costs
and benefits to the Provider of any such reductions. In the event that any
particular Service is reduced other than at the end of a billing period, the
Service Charge associated with such Service for the billing period in which
such Service is reduced shall be pro-rated appropriately. Without limiting
Section 8.01(a), the IMD Entities may request termination of any particular
Service with respect to them upon six (6) months prior written notice in
which case such Service will be terminated and charges for such Service will
cease accruing at the end of such six (6) month period.

  



  

(d) The Recipient may terminate this Agreement upon the occurrence of a Force
Majeure event pursuant to _Section 8.04_ below that materially disrupts the
provision of Services, and Providers failure to fully restore such Services
within 90 days, and the Providers further failure to fully restore such
Services 30 days after its receipt of written notice of Recipients intention
to so terminate pursuant to this _Section 8.01(c) _sent after the expiration
of the initial 90-day period.

  



  

(e) The parties agree to discuss in good faith implementing reasonable
measures to address situations that may arise after the date of this
Agreement in which Recipient requires an extension of the provision of one or
more Services beyond the term provided for herein or Provider requires relief
from the provision of one or more Services because such Services are unduly
burdensome or inconsistent with the strategic and operational objectives of
Provider.

  



  

(f) The BarCap Entities may suspend the Services to an LBHI Entity (but no
other LBHI Entity) that materially defaults in its obligation to perform or
provide Services to any BarCap Entity hereunder, for so long as such default
continues. Without limiting the forgoing,

  



        
   

  



  

such a default shall be deemed to exist where, had such Services been
provided by or been obligated to be provided by LBHI to the BarCap Entities,
the failure to perform or provide such Services would constitute a default by
LBHI.

  



  

Section 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. Upon termination of any particular
Service pursuant to this Agreement, the Provider of the terminated Service
will have no further obligation to provide the terminated Service, and the
relevant Recipient will have no obligation to pay any future Service Charges
relating to any such Service; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Recipient
shall remain obligated to the relevant Provider for (i) the Service Charges
owed and payable in respect of Services provided prior to the effective date
of termination and (ii) any Termination Charges. Upon termination of any
particular Service pursuant to this Agreement, the relevant Provider shall
reduce for the next billing period the amount of the Service Charge for the
category of Services in which the terminated Service was included (such
reduction to reflect the elimination of all costs incurred in connection with
the terminated service to the extent the same are not required to provide
other Services to the Recipient), and, upon request of the Recipient, the
Provider shall provide the Recipient with documentation and/or information
regarding the calculation of the amount of the reduction.

  



  

Section 8.03 _Survival_. In connection with termination of any Service, the
provisions of this Agreement not relating solely to such terminated Service
shall survive any such termination, and in connection with a termination of
this Agreement, _Article I_, _Article VI_ (including liability in respect
of any indemnifiable Losses under this Agreement arising or occurring on or
prior to the date of termination), _Article VII_,  _Article VIII_, _Article
IX_, all confidentiality obligations under this Agreement and liability for
all due and unpaid Service Charges and Termination Charges shall continue to
survive indefinitely.

  



  

Section 8.04 _Force Majeure_. No party hereto (nor any Person acting on its
behalf) shall have any liability or responsibility for failure to fulfill any
obligation (other than a payment obligation) under this Agreement so long as
and to the extent to which the fulfillment of such obligation is prevented,
frustrated, hindered or delayed as a consequence of circumstances of Force
Majeure; _provided_ that (i) such party (or such Person) shall have exercised
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the effect of Force Majeure on
its obligations and (ii) the nature, quality and standard of care that the
Provider shall provide in delivering a Service after a Force Majeure shall be
substantially the same as the nature, quality and standard of care that the
Provider provides to its Affiliates and its other business components with
respect to such Service. In the event of an occurrence of a Force Majeure,
the party hereto whose performance is affected thereby shall give notice of
suspension as soon as reasonably practicable to the other stating the date
and extent of such suspension and the cause thereof, and such party shall
resume the performance of such obligations as soon as reasonably practicable
after the removal of the cause.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 9 

**

  

 **GENERAL PROVISIONS**

  

 ** **

  

Section 9.01 _Independent Contractors_. In providing the Services hereunder,
the Provider shall act solely as independent contractor and nothing in this
Agreement shall constitute

  



         
 

  



  

or be construed to be or create a partnership, joint venture, or
principal/agent relationship between the Provider, on the one hand, and the
Recipient, on the other. All Persons employed by the Provider in the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement shall be the sole
responsibility of the Provider.

  



  

Section 9.02 _Subcontractors_. Any Provider may hire or engage one or more
subcontractors to perform any or all of its obligations under this Agreement;
_provided_ that such Provider shall in all cases remain responsible for all
its obligations under this Agreement. Under no circumstances shall any
Recipient be responsible for making any payments directly to any
subcontractor engaged by a Provider.

  



  

Section 9.03 _Books and Records_. All books, records and data maintained by a
Provider for a Recipient with respect to the provision of a Service to such
Recipient shall be the exclusive property of such Recipient. The Recipient,
at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to inspect, and make
copies of, any such books, records and data during regular business hours
upon reasonable advance notice to the Provider. At the sole cost and expense
of the Recipient, upon termination of the provision of any Service, the
relevant books, records and data relating to such terminated Service shall be
delivered by the Provider to the Recipient in a mutually agreed upon format
to the address of the Recipient set forth in _Section 9.05_ or any other
mutually agreed upon location; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Provider
shall be entitled to retain one copy of all such books, records and data
relating to such terminated Service for archival purposes and for purposes of
responding to any dispute that may arise with respect thereto.

  



  

Section 9.04 _Treatment of Confidential Information_.

  



  

(a) The parties hereto shall not, and shall cause all other Persons providing
Services or having access to information of the other party that is known to
such Person as confidential or proprietary (" _Confidential Information_ ")
not to, disclose to any other Person or use, except for purposes of this
Agreement, any Confidential Information of the other party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each party may disclose Confidential Information of the
other party, to the extent permitted by applicable Law (i) to its
Representatives on a need-to-know basis in connection with the performance of
such partys obligations under this Agreement, (ii) in any report, statement,
testimony or other submission required to be made to any Governmental Body
having jurisdiction over the disclosing party, or (iii) in order to comply
with applicable Law, or in response to any summons, subpoena or other legal
process or formal or informal investigative demand issued to the disclosing
party in the course of any litigation, investigation or administrative
proceeding. In the event that a party hereto becomes legally compelled (based
on advice of counsel) by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar judicial or administrative
process to disclose any Confidential Information of the other party, such
disclosing party shall provide the other party with prompt prior written
notice of such requirement, and, to the extent reasonably practicable,
cooperate with the other party (at such other partys expense) to obtain a
protective order or similar remedy to cause such Confidential Information not
to be disclosed, including interposing all available objections thereto, such
as objections based on settlement privilege. In the event that such
protective order or other similar remedy is not obtained, the disclosing
party shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that
has been legally compelled, and shall exercise

  



        
   

  



  

its reasonable best efforts (at such other partys expense) to obtain
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential
Information.

  



  

(b) Each party hereto shall, and shall cause its Representatives to protect
the Confidential Information of the other parties by using the same degree of
care to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of such as the party uses to
protect its own confidential information of a like nature.

  



  

(c) Each party shall comply with all applicable state, federal and foreign
privacy and data protection Laws that are or that may in the future be
applicable to the provision of the Services hereunder.

  



  

Section 9.05 _Notices_. Except with respect to routine communications by the
BarCap Services Manager and LBHI Services Manager under _Section 2.03_, all

Agreement shall be in writing and shall be given or made (and shall be deemed
to have been duly given or made upon receipt) by delivery in person, by
overnight courier service, by facsimile with receipt confirmed (followed by
delivery of an original via overnight courier service) or by registered or
certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) to the respective

responsible for its own compliance with any and all Laws applicable to its
performance under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of
BarCap and LBHI shall, subject to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses by
the requesting party, cooperate and provide one another with all reasonably
requested assistance (including the execution of documents and the provision
of relevant information) required by the requesting party to ensure
compliance with all applicable Laws in connection with any regulatory action,
requirement, inquiry or examination related to this Agreement or the
Services.

  



  

Section 9.07 _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto covenants and agrees
that, without any additional consideration, it shall execute and deliver any
further legal instruments and perform any acts that are or may become
reasonably necessary to effectuate this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.08 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or as a
matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party
hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
such parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement can be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  



  

Section 9.09 _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, the Purchase Agreement and this Agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, between or on behalf of the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.10 _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall not be assigned or sublicensed by operation of Law
or otherwise without the prior written consent of the parties hereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to _Section 9.10(b)_:

  



  

(i) the LBHI Entities shall have a right to assign their rights and
obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, (A) with respect to the IMD
Entities (as of the date hereof) to one or more related purchasers (in a
single transaction or a series of related

  



        
   

  



  

transactions) of (x) any or all of the IMD Business or (y) any or all of the
assets of, or entities that conduct, the IMD Business, and (B) with respect
to any other acquirors of the Retained LBHI Business, if the absence of such
Service would cause a material adverse effect on the value of the underlying
business operations or assets, and

  



  

(ii) the BarCap Entities may assign their rights and obligations hereunder,
in whole or in part, (A) with respect to any acquirors of the Business, if
the absence of such Service would cause a material adverse effect on the
value of the underlying business operations or assets, and (B) to a single
purchaser (in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of
(x) any or all of the Business or (y) any or all of the assets of, or
entities that conduct, the Business.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the total number of parties to
which each of the LBHI Entities, on one hand, and the BarCap Entities, on the
other hand, may assign their rights and obligations pursuant to _Section
9.10(a)_ shall not exceed six (i.e., up to six separate assignments for each
party to this Agreement); provided that the LBHI Entities shall have the
right to assign their rights and obligations hereunder up to two additional
parties provided that, notwithstanding Section 8.01(a), in the case of such
two additional parties, the Services pursuant to those assigned rights shall
terminate one (1) year after the Closing Date. With respect to the sale of
the following businesses  the IMD Business; the LBHI Entity private equity
business; and the businesses conducted by the LBHI Entities in each of India,
Asia and Europe - if there is an assignment hereunder to a single buyer of
more than one of the foregoing businesses, then, solely for the purposes of
this Section 9.10(b), such assignment shall count as separate assignment for
each of such businesses. For illustrative purposes, if there is an assignment
hereunder to a single buyer for the India and Asian businesses, then it shall
count as two assignments towards the total of 6. The parties agree to
negotiate in good faith if either party requests the right to make additional
assignments hereunder to a buyer of a part of such partys business to which
this Agreement relates if the absence of such Service would cause a material
adverse effect to the underlying business operations or asset being sold.

  



  

(c) Any permitted assignee in accordance with this _Section 9.10_ shall be
required to execute a counterpart to this Agreement, agreeing to be bound by
the terms and conditions set forth herein. Further, permitted assignees
hereunder shall not themselves be permitted to assign any part of the rights
or obligations assigned to them without the prior written consent of the non-
assigning party. Each party shall require any assignee or purchaser of any
business or asset that had been providing (or had been used to provide)
Services hereunder, the absence of which would cause a material adverse
effect to the Recipient, to continue to provide Services to the Recipient
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as a condition to such
assignment or purchase. For the avoidance of doubt, a change of control of an
entity shall be deemed an assignment hereunder.

  



  

(d) Except as provided in _Article 6_ with respect to Provider Indemnified
Parties, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and
their permitted successors and assigns and nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or
