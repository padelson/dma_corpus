_Article I_

 

THE OFFER

Section 1.01.  _The Offer_.

(a) __Commencement of the Offer__. __ Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and provided that the Company shall have complied in all
material respects with its obligations set forth in _Section 1.01_ (g) and
_Section 1.02_, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event,
within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof), Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to
purchase all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at a price per
share equal to the Offer Price (as adjusted as provided in _Section 1.01(c)_
, if applicable).

(b) __Terms and Conditions of the Offer__. __ The respective obligations of
Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, irrevocably accept for
payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
pursuant to the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) are subject only to the
conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ ") (without
limiting the right of Merger Sub to terminate, extend or modify the Offer to
the extent permitted under and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement). The Offer Conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and
Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub may waive, in whole or in part, any
Offer Condition at any time and from time to time, in their sole and absolute
discretion, other than the Minimum Tender Condition, which may be waived by
Parent and Merger Sub only with the prior written consent of the Company in
its sole and absolute discretion. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the
right to increase the Offer Price or to waive or make any other changes to the
terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ that unless otherwise expressly
provided herein or previously approved by the Company in writing (in its sole
and absolute discretion), Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit
Merger Sub to, (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought
to be purchased in the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iv) amend, modify or waive the
Minimum Tender Condition, the Regulatory Condition, the Restraint Condition
or the Termination Condition, (v) add to the Offer Conditions or amend, modify
or supplement the Offer, including any Offer Condition, in any manner adverse
to the Company or any holder of Company Common Stock or in any manner that
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the Offer or the Merger or (vi) extend or otherwise change the expiration
date of the Offer in any manner other than in accordance with the terms of
_Section 1.01_ (d).

(c) __Adjustments__. __ The Offer Price and the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, and such adjustment to the Offer
Price and the Merger Consideration shall provide to the holders of Company
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such action; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 1.01(c)_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

(d) __Expiration and Extension of the Offer__. __ The Offer shall initially
be scheduled to expire at midnight, New York City time, at the end of the
twentieth (20th) Business Day (determined in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
under the Exchange Act) following the commencement (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2

 



-2-  under the Exchange Act) of the Offer. Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer for any period required by applicable
Law, including any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer. If on any then-scheduled expiration date of the
Offer, any of the Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied or, to the
extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub, waived by Parent or Merger Sub,
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), subject to Parents
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.01_, extend the
Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of at least two (2)
Business Days each but no more than ten (10) Business Days each (with the
length of any such extension to be determined by Parent in its sole and
absolute discretion), until such time as such Offer Conditions are satisfied.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall
not be required to extend the Offer beyond the earliest to occur of (i) the
valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_ and (ii) the
Outside Date, and Merger Sub shall not extend the Offer beyond the Outside
Date without the Companys prior written consent. Nothing in this  _Section
1.01(d)_ shall be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner
the right of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01_.

 

(e) __Payment__. __ On the terms specified herein and subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub, waiver by
Parent or Merger Sub of the Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, at the closing of the Offer (" _Offer Closing_ "),
irrevocably accept for payment (such time of acceptance, the " _Acceptance
Time_ "), and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
(and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable
after the applicable expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended in
accordance with _Section 1.01(d)_ ) and in any event in compliance with Rule
14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

(f) __Termination of the Offer__. __ Merger Sub shall not terminate or
withdraw the Offer prior to any scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as it
may be extended in accordance with _Section 1.01(d)_ ) without the prior
written consent of the Company in its sole and absolute discretion; _provided_
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if this Agreement is
validly terminated pursuant to _Section 9.01_ prior to the Acceptance Time,
then Merger Sub shall promptly terminate the Offer and shall not purchase any
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto. If the Offer is terminated
by Merger Sub, or if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section
9.01_ prior to the Acceptance Time, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and
shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return,
all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof
in accordance with applicable Law.

(g) __Offer Documents__. __ On the date of commencement (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub
shall file with the SEC a Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together
with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_"),
which shall include as exhibits an offer to purchase and a related letter of
transmittal, a summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents
pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and the documents
attached as exhibits thereto, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "), and promptly thereafter shall
disseminate the Offer Documents to all holders of Company Common Stock as and
to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, cause the Offer Documents
to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of
applicable Laws. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to cause the Schedule
14D-9 to be mailed or otherwise disseminated together with the Offer
Documents to the holders of Company Common Stock. The Company shall promptly
furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company and
its Subsidiaries that may be required by applicable U.S. federal securities
Laws or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the
Offer Documents. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of the Recommendation of the Company Board. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become inaccurate, false or misleading in any material respect. Parent
and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents,
as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be disseminated to all holders of Company Common Stock, in each
case as soon as reasonably 

 



-3-  practicable and as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal
securities Laws. Except to the extent related to a Takeover Proposal or an
Adverse Recommendation Change occurring after the date hereof (including
Parents or Merger Subs response thereto), (i) prior to the filing of the
Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement thereto) or the
dissemination thereof to the holders of Company Common Stock, Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and to
propose comments on such documents (and shall in good faith give reasonable
consideration to any such comments received from the Company or
its Representatives), (ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the
Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any
request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Offer
Documents, and shall provide the Company with copies of all written
correspondence, and telephonic notification of any material oral
communications, between Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the
other hand, with respect thereto, and (iii) Parent and Merger Sub shall
reasonably consult with and provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the formulation of any written response to any
such written comments of the SEC or its staff, including giving reasonable
consideration in good faith to any comments provided by the Company or its
Representatives on such response. Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable
best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments
of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents.

(h) __Withholding__. _ _ Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), or any other provision of applicable Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

Section 1.02. _Company Actions_.

 

(a) __Schedule 14D-9__. On the date of the initial filing of the Schedule TO,
the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together
with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_"), which
shall describe and make the Recommendation of the Company Board with respect
to the Offer (subject to there not having been an Adverse Recommendation
Change), and promptly thereafter the Company shall disseminate the Schedule
14D-9 to all holders of Company Common Stock as and to the extent required by
applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. The Company shall also include in
the Schedule 14D-9 the Fairness Opinion and the notice and other information
required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. The Company shall cause
the Schedule 14D-9 to comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of applicable Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish
to the Company in writing all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub
that may be required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws or reasonably
requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by
it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information
shall have become inaccurate, false or misleading in any material respect.
The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected,
to be disseminated to all holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as
soon as reasonably practicable and as and to the extent required by applicable
U.S. federal securities Laws. Except to the extent related to a Takeover
Proposal or an Adverse Recommendation Change occurring after the date hereof,
(i) prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or
supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the holders of Company
Common Stock, the Company shall provide Parent and Merger Sub a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such documents (and shall in
good faith give reasonable consideration to any comments provided by Parent or
its Representatives), (ii) the Company shall promptly notify Parent and
Merger Sub upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any
request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the
Schedule 14D-9, and shall provide Parent and Merger Sub with copies of all

 



-4-  written correspondence, and telephonic notification of any material oral
communications, between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect thereto, and (iii)
the Company shall reasonably consult with and provide Parent and Merger Sub
and their respective counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
formulation of any written response to any such written comments of the SEC
or its staff, including giving reasonable consideration in good faith to any
comments provided by Parent or its Representatives on such response. The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9.

(b)  _ _Stockholder Lists__. __ In connection with the Offer and the Merger,
the Company shall instruct its transfer agent to, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its transfer agent to, promptly
furnish Merger Sub with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of
all record and beneficial holders of Company Common Stock as of the most
recent practicable date and of all those persons becoming record holders
subsequent to such date, together with copies of a list of the stockholders
of the Company, security position listings, any available computer file and
all other information in the transfer agents possession or control regarding
the names and addresses of record and beneficial owners of Company Common
Stock that Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request for the purpose of
communicating the Offer to all record and beneficial holders of Company Common
Stock, and shall furnish to Merger Sub such information (including updated
lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files) and
assistance as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request for the purpose of
communicating the Offer to all record and beneficial holders of Company Common
Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall not use or disclose the information
contained in any such labels, lists, listings and files other than in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the Company or (at
Parents election) destroy all copies of such information then in their
possession or control in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(c) __Purchased Shares__. __ The Company shall register (and shall cause its
transfer agent to register) the transfer of shares of Company Common Stock
accepted for payment by Merger Sub effective immediately after the Acceptance
Time.

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT

 

CORPORATIONS

Section 3.01.  _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or any other capital
stock of the Company, or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) __Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. _Each share of capital stock of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) __Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Company Common Stock;
Conversion of Certain Subsidiary Owned Shares__. _ _ Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is at such time owned (i) by the Company as treasury stock or (ii) by
Parent or Merger Sub, in each case shall be automatically canceled and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
Shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or
any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) will
automatically be converted into such number of fully paid and non-assessable
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that the ownership
percentage of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such
Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) __Conversion of Company Common Stock__. __ Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding (i) shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled or converted in
accordance with _Section 3.01(b)_ and (ii) except as provided in _Section
3.01(d)_ , the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive
the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate (each such certificate, a " _Certificate_ "),
and/or each holder of Book-Entry Shares, that, in either case, immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration.

(d)  _ _Appraisal Rights__. __ Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to
demand, and properly demands, appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(c)_ ,
but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. At the
Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to
be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of
the DGCL shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to convert (or
have been converted) at the Effective Time into, and shall become, the right
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(c)_
, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock or
written threats thereof, any withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and Actions
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall 

 



-7-  not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

Section 3.02. _Exchange Fund and Payment Procedures_.

 

(a) __Paying Agent__. __ Prior to the Merger Closing Date, Parent shall
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Article III_ and, in connection
therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Company. On or prior to the Merger Closing Date,
Parent, on behalf of Merger Sub, shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in
an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration as required to
be paid pursuant to this Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Subject to _Section 3.02(g)_ , the Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) __Certificate Exchange Procedures__. __ As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary form), and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable for each such share of Company Common Stock covered by such
Certificates. Each holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to
the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ , and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other
than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 3.02(b)_ , each Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to
receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this _Article III_. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

(c) __Book-Entry Shares__. __ With respect to uncertificated shares of
Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), Parent
and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent
and each holder of Book-Entry Shares to ensure that the Paying Agent will
transmit to such holder or its nominees, upon surrender of Book-Entry Shares
held of record by such holder or its nominees in accordance with customary
surrender procedures (including receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents
message" in customary form and/or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Paying Agent may reasonably request), the Merger Consideration for each
such Book-Entry Share pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, and each such Book-Entry Share shall forthwith be canceled. Payment
of the Merger Consideration with respect to any Book-Entry Share shall only be
made to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Share is registered.

(d) __No Further Transfers of or Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock__.
__ All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates or cancellation of Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be. At the close of

 



-8-  business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall
be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as provided in
this _Article III_.

(e) __Termination of the Exchange Fund__. __ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and the Surviving Corporation
shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

(f) __No Liability__. __ None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in
compliance with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered prior to the date on which the applicable Merger Consideration
would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any
such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
immediately prior to such time become the property of Parent, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) __Investment of Exchange Fund__. __ The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent. No investment
losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the
rights of any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided herein.

(h) __Lost Certificates__. __ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration.

 

Section 3.03. _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) __Treatment of Company Stock Options__.

 

(i) Effective as of the Effective Time, (A) each then-outstanding, vested and
unexercised Company Stock Option and (B) 50% of the unvested portion of each
then-outstanding Company Stock Option held, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, by the individual set forth in Section 3.03(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter (each, a " _Cash-Out Option_") shall automatically be canceled and
converted into the right to receive an amount of cash from the Surviving
Corporation equal to the product of (1) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock then underlying such Cash-Out Option multiplied by (2) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock of such Cash-Out Option, without any interest thereon,
and subject to all applicable Tax withholdings. The Surviving Corporation
shall pay the amounts set forth in this _Section 3.03(a)(i)_ within five (5)
Business Days following the Effective Time.

(ii) Effective as of the Effective Time, each then-outstanding Company Stock
Option other than a Cash-Out Option or an Underwater Option (each, a " _Roll-
Over Option_ ") shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into an
option (a " _Parent Stock Option_ ") to acquire (A) that number of whole
shares of Parent common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Parent Common
Stock") (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares) equal to the
product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such
Roll-Over Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (2) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio, (B) at an

 



-9-  exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock of such Roll-Over Option by (2) the Equity
Award Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section
3.03(a)(ii)_ , each such Parent Stock Option shall continue to have, and shall
be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding
Roll-Over Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (including all
applicable vesting acceleration provisions).

 

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, all Company Stock Options, whether vested or
unvested, that are outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time with
an exercise price per share that equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration
(each, an " _Underwater Option_ ") will not be assumed by Parent and shall
automatically be canceled and terminated without consideration upon the
Effective Time.

(b) __Treatment of Company RSUs__.

 

(i) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU
held by a non-employee director of the Company and 50% of the Company RSUs
held by the individual set forth on Section 3.03(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter (all of the foregoing, the " _Cash-Out RSUs_") that, in each case, are
then-outstanding and unvested shall vest in full and automatically be canceled
and converted into the right to receive an amount of cash from the Surviving
Corporation equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock then underlying such Cash-Out RSU multiplied by (B) the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, and subject to all applicable Tax
withholdings. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the amounts set forth in
this _Section 3.03(b)(i)_ within five (5) Business Days following the
Effective Time or such later time as is required to comply with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

 

(ii) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company RSU other than a Cash-
Out RSU (each, a " _Roll-Over RSU_ ") that is then-outstanding and unvested
shall be assumed by the Parent and shall be converted into a restricted stock
unit award that corresponds to Parent Common Stock (a " _Parent RSU_ ") with
respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest
whole number of shares) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock underlying such Roll-Over RSU multiplied by (B) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section
3.03(b)(ii)_ , each such Parent RSU shall continue to have, and shall be
subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding
Roll-Over RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (including all
applicable vesting acceleration provisions).

(c) __Treatment of Company RSAs__ _._ Effective as of the Effective Time,
each Company RSA that is then-outstanding and unvested shall be assumed by the
Parent and shall be converted into an award representing the right to receive,
on the same vesting schedule as the corresponding Company RSA, an amount in
cash (a " _Parent Cash Award_ ") equal to (A) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying such Company RSA multiplied by (B) the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, and subject to all applicable
Tax withholdings. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 3.03(c)_ ,
each such Parent Cash Award shall continue to have, and shall be subject to,
the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company
RSA immediately prior to the Effective Time (including all applicable vesting
acceleration provisions).

(d) __Treatment of Company MSUs__.

(i) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company MSU
that is then-outstanding and unvested shall automatically be canceled and
converted into: (A) the right to receive an amount of cash from the Surviving
Corporation equal to the product of (1) the Cash Out Number multiplied by (2)
the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and subject to all
applicable Tax withholdings, and (B) a Parent RSU with respect to a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole number of shares)
equal to the product of (1) the Rollover Number multiplied by (2) the Equity
Award Exchange Ratio. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the amounts set
forth in _Section 3.03(d)(i)(A)_ within five (5) Business Days

 



-10-  following the Effective Time or such later time as is required to comply
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Except as otherwise
provided in _Section 3.03(d)(i)(B)_ , each such Parent RSU shall continue to
have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the
corresponding Company MSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
all applicable vesting acceleration provisions);  _provided_ that all such
Parent RSUs shall be subject to service-based vesting only and shall no longer
be subject to any performance-based vesting criteria.

 

(ii) For purposes of this _Section 3.03(d)_ : (A) " _Total Number_ " means,
for each Company MSU, (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock earned
with respect to such Company MSU as determined in accordance with the
applicable award agreements and based on the actual achievement of relative
TSR during the Short Performance Period, determined using the following
inputs: (x) Company TSR computed by comparing (I) the value of the Merger
Consideration to (II) the average closing price of the Company Common Stock
during the First Measurement Period and (y) TSR of the Russell 2000 Index
computed by comparing (I) the average closing price of the Russell 2000 Index

of shares of Company Common Stock corresponding to such Company MSU that
vested on March 10, 2017; (B) " _Short Performance Period_ " means the portion

date that is three (3) Business Days prior to the Merger Closing Date; (C) "

Period_ " means the thirty (30) calendar days ending on the date that is three

of which is (x) the number of days that have elapsed during the applicable
three-year performance period through the Merger Closing Date and (y) the
denominator of which is 1,095; _provided_ , _however_ that the Cash Out Number
for each Company MSU held by the individual set forth in Section 3.03(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter shall equal 50% of the Total Number
corresponding to such Company MSU; and (F) " _Rollover Number_ " means, for
each Company MSU, the number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to (1)
the Total Number minus (2) the Cash Out Number. For the avoidance of doubt,
any portion of a Company MSU that is not deemed to be earned in accordance
with this _Section 3.03(d)_ will be terminated as of the Effective Time for
no consideration.

(e) __Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan__. __ With respect to the
Companys 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ "), as soon as

prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs) of each outstanding
purchase right pursuant to the ESPP. On such exercise date for the Final
Offering Period, the Company will apply the funds credited as of such date
pursuant to the ESPP within each participants payroll withholding account to
the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of the ESPP. Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective
Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger), the Company will

Intellectual Property Rights exclusively licensed to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries).

Judgment restricting or limiting in any material respect the use, licensing

including the consummation of the Offer and the Merger, will not, with
respect to any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, (i) result in Parent or any of its Affiliates being obligated to grant
to any third party any rights (including expanded rights) with respect
to Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights, except for such
obligations applicable to the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries under
Owned Company Intellectual Property resulting from Contracts to which the
Company or its Subsidiaries are a party immediately prior to the Merger
Closing Date and which apply only to the same extent as currently applicable
to the Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii) result in the Surviving

(o) During the five (5) years prior to the date hereof, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or complaint that
it has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of any license to any
Open Source Materials. To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of or has breached any of the
material terms or conditions of any material license to any Open Source
Materials in any material respect. The Company has not used, incorporated,
combined or distributed any Open Source Materials with any Software of the
Company Products that the Company intends to keep proprietary in a manner
that requires that such Software for such Company Products be (i) disclosed or
distributed or otherwise made available in source code form, (ii) licensed for
the purpose of making derivative works, (iii) redistributable at no charge or
minimal charge or (iv) licensed under the same license as such Open Source
Materials.

(p) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a member of or party

existing or future Copyrights or Patents against any person.

 

(q) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has intentionally included
in the Company Products any disabling mechanisms or protection features that

or file without the users consent.

businesses. The Company and its Subsidiaries have

 



-33-  disaster recovery and business continuity plans, procedures and facilities

business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of the
Company, there have been no materially unauthorized intrusions or breaches of
the security of such information technology systems.

 

(s) No source code of any Software used in any Company Product has been
disclosed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except (i) for
disclosure to employees or individual independent contractors of the Company
or such Subsidiaries on a need-to-know basis and who are bound
by confidentiality agreements with respect to such disclosure or (ii) to
escrow agents under source code escrow agreements with such escrow agents that
include reasonable non-disclosure provisions. Section 4.16(s) of the Company
Disclosure Letter includes a true and complete list of all such escrow
agreements and arrangements and the Company has made available to Parent all
such agreements. No condition has occurred that would be sufficient to
entitle the beneficiary under any source code escrow arrangement under which
the Company or any Subsidiary has deposited any such source code for Company
Products to require release of such source code from escrow. The consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger)
will not constitute a source code escrow release condition to require release
of such source code for Company Products from escrow.

institution has ownership rights or any ownership interest in or to any
Company Intellectual Property Rights.

Product, except for such assertions that, individually or in the aggregate,

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) there have been and are

-43- If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries desires to take an action that would
be prohibited pursuant to this _Section 6.01(a)_ without the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company may seek such written consent by sending an
email or contacting by telephone either of the two (2) Representatives of
Parent designated by Parent and listed on Section 6.01(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter (for the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph will apply in
lieu of _Section_ __ _ 11.03_ with respect to any consents sought by the
Company pursuant to this _Section 6.01(a)_ ).

(b) __Conduct of Business by Merger Sub__. __ Until the earlier of the
Effective Time and the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.01_, except as otherwise expressly contemplated pursuant to this
Agreement or as required by applicable Law, Merger Sub shall not engage in any
activity of any nature except for activities related to or in furtherance of
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(c)  _ _Notice of Changes__. Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_, each of the
Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of: (i) any written
notice or other written communication received by such Party from any person
alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection
with the Offer or the Merger if the failure to obtain such consent would
materially affect the consummation of the Offer or the Merger; and (ii) any
Actions commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened against, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
that purport to materially affect the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger, or that make allegations that, if true, would have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Until the earlier of the Effective
Time and the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_,
the Company shall promptly notify Parent of (A) any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty of the Company contained herein at any time during
the term hereof; and (B) any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy
any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, in
each case, if and only to the extent that such inaccuracy or failure to comply
would cause any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the Offer or Merger to not be satisfied at the Offer Closing or
the Merger Closing, respectively. For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.01(c)_ shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice and
shall not cure any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement.

 

Section 6.02. _Non-Solicitation; Change of Recommendation_.

 

(a) __No Solicitation__. __ Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the

the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, and shall use reasonable best efforts

submission or announcement of any inquiries, proposals or offers that
constitute or would reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover
Proposal, (ii) provide any nonpublic information concerning the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to any person or group in connection with any Takeover

be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with
any person or groups that may be ongoing with respect to any Takeover Proposal
or potential Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly after the date
hereof instruct each person (if any) that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement (other than the Confidentiality Agreement) relating
to a Takeover Proposal or potential Takeover Proposal with or for the benefit
of the 

 



-44-  Company promptly to return to the Company or destroy all information,
documents, and materials relating to the Takeover Proposal or to the Company
or its businesses, operations or affairs heretofore furnished by the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to such
person or any of its Representatives in accordance with the terms of such
confidentiality agreement, and shall enforce (including by seeking an
injunction) the contractual rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under any such agreement with respect thereto, and shall enforce, and not
waive, terminate or modify without Parents prior written consent, any
standstill or similar provision in any confidentiality, standstill or other
agreement with such person; _provided_ that the Company may waive any
standstill or similar provisions to the extent necessary to permit a person to
make, on a confidential basis to the Company Board, a Takeover Proposal,
conditioned upon such person agreeing to disclosure of such Takeover Proposal
to Parent and Merger Sub, in each case as contemplated by this _Section 6.02_
( _provided_ , _further_ that the Company may only take such action if the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that the failure of the Company Board to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law). The Company shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits
the Company from providing to Parent the information required to be provided
to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.02_.

person or group providing for (a) any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, of (1)
assets representing 20% or more of the aggregate fair market value of the
consolidated assets (including Intellectual Property Rights) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (but excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any license of Intellectual Property Rights entered into in the
ordinary course of business), or (2) shares of Company Common Stock or any
other Company Securities or Company Subsidiary Securities, which together
with any other shares of Company Common Stock or other Company Securities or
Company Subsidiary Securities beneficially owned by such person or group,
would represent 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
or other Company Securities or Company Subsidiary Securities, (b) any tender
offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person or
group owning, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock or other Company Securities or Company Subsidiary
Securities, (c) any merger, consolidation, business combination, share
exchange or similar transaction involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or group (or the shareholders
of any person) would own, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the aggregate
voting power of the Company or of the surviving entity in a merger or the
resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity
or 20% or more of the aggregate fair market value of the consolidated assets
(including Intellectual Property Rights) of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (d) any reorganization, recapitalization, extraordinary
dividend, liquidation, dissolution or any other similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its material operating Subsidiaries whose business
represents 20% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for the twelve
(12)-month period ending on January 31, 2017, other than, in each case, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any proposal or offer by

outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or (b) more than 50% of the
aggregate fair market value of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case, which the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) to be more favorable to the stockholders of the Company
from a financial point of view than the Offer and the Merger, in each case,
taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including any changes to the

 



-45-  terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent pursuant to _Section 6.02(e)_ )
that the Company Board determines to be relevant and which the Company Board
determines to be reasonably capable of being completed in accordance with its
terms (including, in the case of a cash transaction (in whole or in part), the
Company Board determining that financing is then fully committed or reasonably
determined to be available), taking into account all financial, legal,
regulatory and other aspects of such Takeover Proposal that the Company Board
determines to be relevant.

did not result from a material breach of this _Section 6.02_, and (ii) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal
and that the failure to take such action described in clause (A) or (B) of
this _Section 6.02(b)_ would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company
may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
to the person making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ that the Company shall substantially
concurrently provide to Parent any nonpublic information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any person and which was not
previously provided to Parent), and/or (B) engage in discussions or
negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal regarding such
Takeover Proposal; _provided_ that prior to or concurrently with the Company
taking any action described in clause (A) or (B) of this _Section 6.02(b)_ ,
the Company shall provide written notice to Parent of such determination of
the Company Board as provided for in this _Section 6.02(b)(ii)_.

 

(c) __Notice to Parent of Takeover Proposals__. __ The Company shall promptly
(and, in any event, within one (1) Business Day) notify Parent orally and in
writing in the event that the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives receives any Takeover Proposal, or any initial
request for nonpublic information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries related to, or from any person or group in connection with, any
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be

requests, proposals or offers) and the nature of such request, and thereafter
the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably timely basis
of the status and material details of discussions with respect thereto,
including any material changes to the terms thereof. Without limiting any of
the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1)
Business Day) notify Parent in writing if it determines to begin providing
information or to begin engaging in discussions or negotiations concerning a
Takeover Proposal pursuant to _Section 6.02(b)_ and shall in no event begin
providing such information or begin engaging in such discussions or
negotiations prior to providing such notice. The Company shall provide Parent
with at least one (1) Business Days prior notice (or such shorter notice as
may be provided to the Company Board) of each meeting of the Company Board at
which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider any Takeover
Proposal.

 

(d) __Prohibited Activities__. __ Neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw or rescind (or modify or qualify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw or rescind
(or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the
Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend the adoption of, or publicly
propose to approve, declare the advisability of or recommend the adoption of,
any Takeover Proposal, (iii) cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any confidentiality agreement,
exclusivity agreement, license agreement, letter of intent, memorandum of

or other similar Contract related to any Takeover Proposal, other than any
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement referred to in _Section 6.02(b)_ (an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ "), (iv) publicly propose or publicly announce an
intention to take any of the

 



-46-  foregoing actions, (v) following the date any Takeover Proposal or any
material modification thereto is first made public or sent or given to the

reaffirms the Recommendation within five (5) Business Days following Parents
written request to do so (which request may only be made once with respect to
any such Takeover Proposal and each material modification thereto), or (vi)
fail to include the Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or any amendment
thereof when disseminated to the Companys stockholders (any action described
in clause _(i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iv)_ (other than as it applies to clause
_(iii))_ , _(v)_ or _(vi)_ of this _Section 6.02(d)_ being referred to as an
" _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 

(e) __Change of Recommendation__. __ Notwithstanding _Section 6.02(d)_ , at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may, subject to
compliance in all material respects with the other provisions of this _Section
6.02_, (x) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(f)_ in order to
enter into an Acquisition Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal, or (y)
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event;

consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, (2) in the case of _Section 6.02(e)(x)_ , the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors) that the applicable Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company terminates this Agreement

written notice to Parent and Merger Sub, at least four (4) Business Days in
advance, that it will take the applicable action referred to in _Section

itself constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), and (4) the Company has
complied in all material respects with the following additional covenants:

 

(i) if such action is being taken pursuant to _Section 6.02(e)(x)_ , and if
requested by Parent, after providing any such Notice of Intended

Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith during
any such four (4) Business Day period (it being understood and agreed that any
material amendment to the terms of any such Superior Proposal (and in any
event including any amendment to any price term thereof) shall require a new
Notice of Intended Recommendation Change and compliance with the other
requirements of this _Section 6.02(e)_ anew except that references herein to
a four (4) Business Day period shall be deemed to be references to a two (2)
Business Day period) regarding any written and binding proposal by Parent to
amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby and at the end of such four (4) Business Day period (or
two (2) Business Day period in the case of a material amendment) the Company
Board again makes the determinations described in clauses (1) and (2) of this
_Section 6.02(e)_ with respect to such Superior Proposal; and

(ii) if such Adverse Recommendation Change is being made pursuant to _Section
6.02(e)(y)_ :

(1) such Adverse Recommendation Change is being made as a result of an event,
fact, development or occurrence that materially affects the business, assets
or operations of the Company and that was not known or reasonably foreseeable
by the Company Board as of the date hereof and becomes known to the Company
Board after the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time (each, an "

matter relating thereto or any consequences thereof, (III) the fact, in

_Section 6.02_ shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. In addition, nothing in this
Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board from making the

 _Article VII_

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 7.01. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Until the earlier of
the Effective Time and the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.01_, the Company shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to
afford to Parent, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives,
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable prior notice
to the Company, to all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries properties,
books and records (but excluding any confidential information contained in
personnel files to the extent the disclosure of such information is
prohibited by Privacy Laws and any documents, records or information that
relates to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, the process that
led to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or, subject to
the disclosure requirements set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, to any
Takeover Proposal) and to those management or other key employees of the
Company to whom Parent reasonably requests access, and, during such period,
and subject to the limitations described in parentheses above, the Company
shall furnish to Parent, as promptly as reasonably practicable, (a) all
information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request and (b) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities
laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or disclose information
where such access or disclosure would (i) reasonably be expected to jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
violate any confidentiality obligations to a third party (in which case the
Company will give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such
information or documents and the Parties will use their reasonable best
efforts to institute appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, to the
extent practical in the circumstances), or (ii) contravene any applicable Law.
Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives (as applicable) to comply with, all of their respective
obligations provided in the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to
information obtained pursuant to this _Section 7.01_.

 

Section 7.02. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Approvals; Transaction Litigation_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, each of the
Parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer Conditions and the
conditions to the Merger Closing to be satisfied, in each case, as promptly as
reasonably practicable; (ii) obtain all necessary

 



-48-  Governmental Authorizations of or by any Governmental Authority and make all
necessary registrations, declarations and filings with, and notices to, such
Governmental Authorities (including pursuant to the HSR Act) and take all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid an Action by, any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) execute
and deliver any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) vigorously defend or contest any
Action brought by any private party that would otherwise prevent or materially
impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Transaction Litigation. " _Transaction Litigation_ " means any Action
commenced or threatened against any Party or any of its Affiliates by
any private party relating to, arising out of or involving this Agreement
(including any stockholder litigation, regardless of whether the claims
therein are brought directly by stockholders or on behalf of the Company or
otherwise), the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby or that would otherwise prevent or materially impede,
interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, Transaction Litigation shall not include any Action brought or
threatened by any Governmental Authority.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees
to (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant
to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby within
ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof, (ii) make appropriate filings

(collectively, " _Specified Foreign Merger Control Laws_ "), formally or in
draft form (where pre-filing consultation is required), within ten (10)
Business Days of the date hereof, (iii) supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any Specified Foreign Merger Control
Laws, and (iv) use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken
all other actions necessary, proper or advisable consistent with this 
_Section 7.02_ to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods, or receipt of required Governmental Authorizations, as
applicable, under the HSR Act and the Specified Foreign Merger Control Laws as
soon as practicable. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties shall
request early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act. No Party
shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or withdraw
its notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act or any other filing
made pursuant to any Specified Foreign Merger Control Law or other regulatory
Law unless each of the other Parties has given its prior written consent to
such extension or delay.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Parties
hereby agree and acknowledge that neither this  _Section 7.02_ nor the
"reasonable best efforts" standard shall require, or be construed to require
Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates, in order to obtain any required approval from any Governmental
Authority or any third party, to: (i) (A) sell, lease, license, transfer,
dispose of, divest or otherwise encumber, or hold separate pending any such
action, or (B) propose, negotiate or offer to effect, or consent or commit
to, any such sale, leasing, licensing, transfer, disposal, divestiture or
other encumberment, or holding separate, before or after the Acceptance Time
or the Effective Time, of any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product
lines, businesses or interest therein of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates), or
(ii) take or agree to take any other action or agree or consent to any
limitations or restrictions on freedom of actions with respect to, or its
ability to retain, or make changes in, any such assets, licenses, operations,
rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein of Parent, the Company
or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
other Affiliates) if taking any such action described in clause _(i)_ or
_(ii)_ would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries. For the purposes of this _Section 7.02(c)_ , a
material adverse effect shall be measured relative to the size of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, regardless of whether such actions
are imposed on, or affect Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries.

(d) Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any Governmental
Authority, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other Party apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other

 



-49-  communications received by Parent or any of its Representatives, or the
Company or any of its Representatives, as the case may be, from any third
party and/or any Governmental Authority with respect to the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Company and Parent
will furnish to the other Party such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other Party may request in connection with the preparation
of any required governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in
responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including promptly
informing the other Party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making
any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, giving the
other Party the opportunity to review in advance any proposed submissions to a
Governmental Authority and considering in good faith any comments provided by
the other Party on such submission, and supplying each other with copies of
all correspondence, filings or communications between any Party, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Authority, on the other hand, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Company and Parent will give
the other Party a reasonable opportunity to attend any meetings, or to
participate in any communications with, a Governmental Authority to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority. For the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of _Section 1.01(g)_ and _Section 1.02(a)_ , and not this _Section
7.02(d)_ , shall govern the matters referred to therein.

 

(e) Each of Parent and the Company shall keep each other reasonably informed
regarding any Transaction Litigation, but only to the extent that doing so
would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Party, jeopardize any legal
privilege of such Party with respect thereto, it being agreed that each Party
will reasonably cooperate with the other Parties to permit such inspection of
or to disclose such information in a manner that does not compromise or waive
such privilege with respect thereto. The Company shall promptly advise Parent
orally and in writing and the Company shall cooperate fully with Parent (and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to cooperate
fully with Parent) in connection with, and shall consult with and permit
Parent and its Representatives to participate in, the defense, negotiations or
settlement of any Transaction Litigation and the Company shall give due
consideration to Parents advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation.
The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
its or their Representatives to, compromise, settle, come to a settlement
arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation or consent thereto unless in
each case Parent shall consent thereto in advance in writing (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 

(f) Prior to the Merger Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent
and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the New

-50-  promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act
to eliminate the effects of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. No Adverse

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
" _Company Employee_ "), for so long as such Company Employee remains employed

(b) Each Company Employee shall be given credit for all service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors for purposes
of eligibility for vacation and service recognition awards under the employee
benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their
Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee becomes a participant, and
eligibility under the Family and Medical Leave Act; _provided_ that foregoing
service credit shall not apply to the extent that its application would result
in a duplication of benefits.

 

(c) With respect to each health and welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation for the benefit of Company Employees, Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) the waiver of all
limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Company
Employees (and their eligible dependents) under such plan to the extent that
such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods were waived or satisfied under
the comparable health or welfare benefit plans of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) each Company Employee (or his or her
eligible dependents) to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid
by the Company Employee (or his or her eligible dependents) under any similar
Company Benefit Plan for the plan year that includes the Effective Time for
purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under such plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, for the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs.

 

(d) If requested by Parent not less than ten (10) Business Days before the
anticipated Effective Time, the Company Board (or the appropriate committee
thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as is
necessary to terminate the Companys 401(k) plans (collectively, the "
_Company 401(k) Plan_ "), effective as of the day prior to the day on which
the Effective Time occurs. Following the Effective Time and as soon as
practicable following receipt of a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service on the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, the
assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants, and Parent shall, to
the extent permitted by Parents applicable 401(k) plan (the " _Parent 401(k)
Plan_ "), permit the Company Employees who are then actively employed to make
rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, inclusive of loans to participants)
to the Parent 401(k) Plan, in the form of cash (or in the case of loans,
notes), in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such
Company Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan.

(e) At the Effective Time, the Parent shall assume, perform and discharge in
accordance with their applicable terms (including any applicable rights to
amend or terminate any such arrangements) all obligations of

Company Benefit Plan providing for acceleration of vesting of Company Equity
Awards and each Company Benefit Plan providing for severance or other
termination pay and/or benefits.

(f) The Company and Parent will discuss in good faith the impact of Sections
280G and 4999 of the Code with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and will discuss with each other in good faith their respective
calculations and positions with respect to the same.

 

(g) Without limiting _Section 11.05_, the Parties acknowledge and agree that
all provisions contained in this  _Section 7.04_ are included for the sole
benefit of the Parties, and that nothing herein, whether express or implied,
(i) shall create any third-party beneficiary or other rights (A) in any other
person, including any employees or former employees of the Company, any of
the Companys Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of the Company, any Company
Employee, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (B) to continued
employment with Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation), (ii) shall be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or employee
benefit plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries, or (iii) shall limit the right of
Parent or its Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation) to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company
Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries following
the Effective Time.

Section 7.05. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto existing as of the date hereof in
favor of any person who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been
at any time prior to the date hereof, a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the
Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company Bylaws, the equivalent
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company which has been made
available to Parent, or any indemnification agreement between such
Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which has been
made available to Parent, shall survive the Merger and continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their respective terms. For a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
Certificate of Incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
exculpation, limitation of liabilities and advancement of expenses with
respect to present and former directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to
have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time than are as set forth in the
Company Certificate of Incorporation or the Company Bylaws and shall not
amend, repeal or otherwise modify the Surviving Corporation Certificate of
Incorporation or the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Parties with
respect to indemnification, exculpation and limitation of liabilities of the
Indemnified Parties and advancement of expenses.

(b) Without limiting _Section 7.05(a)_ , from and after the Effective Time, in
the event of any threatened or actual Action, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a director (including in
a capacity as a member of any board committee), or officer of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold
harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each such
Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses (including payment of reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any Action to each Indemnified Party to
the fullest extent permitted by Law upon receipt of any undertaking required
by applicable Law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in
connection with any such threatened or actual Action. Any determination of
entitlement to indemnification under the preceding sentences shall be made by
an independent counsel selected jointly by the Surviving Corporation and such
Indemnified Party. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense of any matter for which such
Indemnified Party has validly sought indemnification under such
indemnification agreement; _provided_ that no Indemnified Person will be
liable for any settlement of such matter

 



-52-  effected without his or her prior written consent. Parents and the
Surviving Corporations obligations under this Section 7.05(b) shall continue
in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the Effective
Time; provided that all rights hereunder in respect of any Action asserted or
made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
Action.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party on terms with respect to
such coverage and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than those of
such policies in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an aggregate annual premium
for such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid by
the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year for such insurance
(which amount the Company represents and warrants is set forth in Section
7.05(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter) (the " _Maximum Premium_ ");
_provided_ , _ _ _further_ that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, if and to the extent available commercially,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount;
_provided_ , ___further_ that Parent may substitute therefor policies of a
reputable national insurance company (with comparable credit ratings to the
Companys existing carrier) the material terms of which, including with
respect to coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect
to any Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company (prior to
the Merger Closing Date) may (after reasonable consultation with Parent), or
at Parents written request prior to the Merger Closing Date will, or Parent
or the Surviving Corporation upon the Effective Time may, obtain in lieu of
the insurance contemplated by the preceding sentence a prepaid (or "tail")
directors and officers liability insurance policy in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six (6) years from
the Effective Time, covering each person who is covered by such policies on
the date hereof on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less
favorable than those of such policies in effect on the date hereof; _provided_
that the maximum premium for such tail insurance policy shall not be in
excess of the Maximum Premium; _provided_ , _further_ that any such tail
policy may not be amended, modified or canceled or revoked by the Company,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation in any manner that is adverse to the
beneficiaries.

 

(d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and other
assets to any person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then,
and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation and Parent, respectively,
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable successors and
assigns or transferees expressly assume the obligations set forth in this 
_Section 7.05_ unless assumed by operation of Law.

(e) From and after the Effective Time (but not prior thereto), the provisions
of this _Section 7.05_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs. The provisions of
this _Section 7.05_ are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
by contract or otherwise.

with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to

of such content to the extent replicated in whole or in part in any subsequent
press 

 



-53-  release or other public statement, and (b) the Parties may make public
statements in response to questions by the press, analysts, investors or those

by one Party in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 7.06_ and do not reveal
material nonpublic information regarding this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 7.07. _Financing Matters_. The Company shall deliver to Merger Sub, at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the Acceptance Time, a payoff letter

contrary, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, from and
after the date hereof and until the Effective Time, enter into, establish,
amend or modify any plan, program, agreement or arrangement pursuant to which
compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which benefits are provided,
in each case to any current or former director, manager, officer, employee or

by applicable Law.

Section 7.10. _No Control of the Other Party s Business_. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are
not intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
business or operations of the other at any time prior to the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company will exercise,
consistent with the terms, conditions and restrictions of this Agreement,

termination of this Agreement under circumstances in which the Company
Termination Fee is payable by the Company pursuant to this _Section 9.03_ and
the Company pays in full of the Company Termination Fee to Parent (or a
person designated by Parent in writing), such Company Termination Fee shall
be deemed to be liquidated damages, and not a penalty, payable to Parent and,
except in the case of fraud or any willful breach of this Agreement (which
fraud or willful breach shall be governed by _Section 9.02_), receipt of the
Company Termination Fee shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates for any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or any of its Affiliates
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the termination thereof or any matter forming a basis for such
termination). Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall be entitled to seek any other remedy, at law or in equity or
otherwise, including bringing or maintaining any Action against, or seeking

Representatives and assignees of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries),
arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the termination of this Agreement or any matters forming the basis
for such termination). If the Company fails promptly to pay any fee or
reimburse any amount due pursuant to this _Section 9.03_, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences an Action that results in an award
against the Company for such fee or reimbursement, the Company shall pay to
Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in
connection with such Action, together with interest on the amount of the
applicable fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the

(a) When a reference is made herein to an Article, a Section, Annex or
Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or a Section of, or an Annex
or Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

(b) The table of contents, headings and index of defined terms contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

(c) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning and
effect of the word "shall." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer
to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if." The word "or" when used herein is not exclusive. Any
references herein to "dollars" or "$" shall mean U.S. dollars. The words "as
of the date hereof," "as of the date of this Agreement" and words of
similar import shall be deemed in each case to refer to the date of this
Agreement as set forth in the Preamble hereto.

(d) The phrase "made available," when used in reference to anything made
available to Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives shall be deemed to
mean uploaded to and made available to Parent, Merger Sub and their

days prior to the date hereof in the online data room hosted on behalf of the
Company by Fenwick and West LLP under the name "Project Nitrogen."

 

(e) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed without regard to any
presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against any Party
drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted.

 

(f) References to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.
All terms defined herein shall have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein.

(g) All capitalized terms not defined in the Company Disclosure Letter shall
have the meanings ascribed to them herein. Any information set forth in one
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to
apply to and qualify (i) the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which
it corresponds in number and (ii) in the case of information set forth in
_Article IV_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, each other Section or
subsection of _Article IV_ to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on
its face that such information is relevant to such other Section or
subsection. The mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Letter as
an exception to a representation or warranty or covenant, as applicable,
shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
constitutes a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(h) The definitions contained herein are applicable to the singular as well as
the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the

TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

Section 11.10. _Specific Performance; Remedies_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not
be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby) is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
is otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties agree that, prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 9.01_, each
Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other
appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and

accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.08_, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled under the terms of this Agreement at law or
in equity.

manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

 

Section 11.12 _Counterparts; Facsimile and Electronic Signatures_. This
Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the
other Parties. This Agreement or any counterpart may be executed
and delivered by facsimile copies or delivered by electronic communications
by portable document format (.pdf), each of which shall be deemed an original.

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

 

Notwithstanding any other term or provision of the Offer or the Agreement, and
in addition to Merger Subs rights to extend, amend or terminate the Offer in
accordance with the provisions of the Agreement and applicable Law, Merger Sub
shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub
to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger
Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock
promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any
shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer and may delay
the acceptance for payment of, or, subject to the restrictions referred to
above, the payment for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered, if:

(a) there shall not have been validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn)
immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer a number of shares of
Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Common Stock
(if any) then owned by Parent or Merger Sub, equals at least one (1) share
more than half of all shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (the "
_Minimum Tender Condition_ ");

(b) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended
in accordance with the Agreement), any waiting period (and any extensions
thereof) and any Governmental Authorizations applicable to the Offer or the
consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act or any Specified Foreign Merger
Control Law shall not have expired, or been terminated or obtained, as
applicable (the " _Regulatory Condition_ "); or

(c) any of the following conditions shall have occurred and be continuing as
of the expiration of the Offer:

(i) there shall be any Restraint in effect enjoining, restraining or
otherwise preventing or prohibiting the making of the Offer or the
consummation of the Merger or the Offer (the " _Restraint Condition_ ");

 

(ii) any of the representations and warranties of the Company (A) set forth in
the first sentence of  _Section 4.01_, _Section 4.04_, _Section 4.24_,
_Section 4.25_ and _Section 4.26_ shall not be true and correct in all
respects as of the date of the Agreement and as of the expiration of the
Offer as though made as of the expiration of the Offer (except, in each case,
to the extent any such representations and warranties are made as of a
specific date, in which case such representations and warranties shall not be
true and correct in all respects as of such specific date only), (B) set
forth in _Section 4.27_ shall not be true and correct in all material
respects (disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to "materiality,"
"Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set forth therein) as
of the date of the Agreement and as of the expiration of the Offer as though
made as of the expiration of the Offer (except, in each case, to the extent
any such representations and warranties are made as of a specific date, in
which case such representations and warranties shall not be true and correct
in all material respects (disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to
"materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set
forth therein) as of such specific date only), (C) set forth in _Section
4.03(a)_ and _Section 4.03(b)_ shall not be true and correct in all respects
as of the date of the Agreement and as of the expiration of the Offer as
though made as of the expiration of the Offer (except, in each case, to the
extent any such representations and warranties are made as of a specific date,
in which case such representations and warranties shall not be true and
correct in all respects as of such specific date only), except, in the case of
this clause (C), for inaccuracies that, individually or the aggregate, would
not increase the aggregate amount payable by Merger Sub or Parent in the
Offer or the Merger by more than a _de minimis_ amount and (D) set forth in
the Agreement, other than those described in clause (A), (B) or (C), shall not
be true and correct in all respects (disregarding all qualifications or
limitations as to "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" and words of
similar import set forth therein) as of the date of the Agreement and as of
the expiration of the Offer as though made as of the expiration of the Offer
(except, in each case, to the extent any such representations and warranties
are made as of a specific date, in which case such representations and
warranties shall not be true and correct in all respects (disregarding all
qualifications or limitations as to "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect"
and

 



I-1  words of similar import set forth therein) as of such specific date only)
except, in the case of this clause (D), where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct has not had and
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect;

(iii) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material
respects with all of its obligations required to be performed or complied with
by it under the Agreement;

 

(iv) since the date of the Agreement, there shall have occurred any Material
Adverse Effect that is continuing;

 

(v) Merger Sub shall have failed to receive a certificate of the Company,
executed by the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of the
Company, dated as of the expiration date of the Offer, to the effect that the
conditions set forth in paragraphs _(c)(ii)_ , _(c)(iii)_ and _(c)(iv)_ of
this _Annex I_ have been satisfied; or

 

(vi) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms
(the " _Termination Condition_ ").

 

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights and obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate, amend
or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. The
foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub in
whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole and absolute
discretion (other than the Minimum Tender Condition). The failure by Parent or
Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
