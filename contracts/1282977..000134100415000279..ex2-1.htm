Section 2.3 Payment of Escrow. At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay (or cause
to be paid) to an escrow agent to be mutually agreed by Purchaser and the
Seller Representative (the "Escrow Agent") an amount in cash (the "Escrow Cash
Amount") and Purchaser Common Stock (the "Escrow Stock Amount") representing
7.54 percent of the aggregate amount of Closing Cash Consideration and 13.76 %
of the aggregate amount of the Closing Stock Consideration (the "Escrow
Amount") in accordance with the terms and conditions of an Escrow Agreement to
be entered into at Closing in a form to be mutually agreed by the Seller
Representative, Purchaser and the Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Agreement"). The
Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement to satisfy the obligations, if any, under Section 2.4
(Working Capital Adjustment), Section 8.8(a) (Tax Matters, Seller Indemnity)
and Article X (Indemnification), and, following the final resolution of any
such adjustments and satisfaction of any such indemnity obligations, shall be
released in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement to, as
applicable, (i) the Sellers in accordance with the Applicable Percentages set
forth opposite their names in the Transaction Consideration Disbursement
Schedule (with cash being released to the Non-Employee Sellers and Purchaser
Common Stock being released to Employee Sellers as set forth on such schedule)
and/or (ii) Purchaser as further described in the Escrow Agreement. Earnings
on payments from the Escrow Amount shall be paid concurrently to the recipient
of such payment. The Purchaser Common Stock comprising the Escrow Stock Amount
shall be registered as of the Closing Date in the name of the applicable
Seller.

  

  

Section 2.4 Working Capital Adjustment.

  

  

(a) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than one hundred (100)
days after the Closing Date, the Seller Representative shall in good faith
prepare and deliver to Purchaser (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the
Consolidated

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

Companies as of the Balance Sheet Time, disregarding minority interests, if
applicable (the "Proposed Closing Balance Sheet") and (ii) a written statement
signed by the Seller Representative setting forth in reasonable detail (and
together with reasonable supporting documentation) (A) the Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount as of the Balance Sheet Time (the "Proposed Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount") and the components of such calculation (including
the calculation of the Net Working Capital Target), as derived from the
Proposed Closing Balance Sheet, as well as details as to whether each accounts
receivable and taxes receivable of the Companies and their Subsidiaries
outstanding as of the Closing Date was paid to the Companies, their
Subsidiaries or the Purchaser as of the 90th day anniversary of the Closing
Date. The Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount derived therefrom shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied, based on the books and records of the Companies and
their Subsidiaries, on a basis and in a manner consistent with the preparation
of the sample calculation (based on the December 31, 2014 combining financial
statements of the Companies) set forth on Schedule 2.4(a) hereto.

  

  

(b) The Companies and Purchaser shall permit the Seller Representative and its
Representatives to have reasonable access to any books, records and other
documents (including work papers) necessary in connection with preparation of
the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and calculation of the Proposed Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount and provide the Seller Representative with copies
thereof (as reasonably requested by the Seller Representative), as well as to
personnel of the Consolidated Companies. If Purchaser disagrees with the
Seller Representative's calculation of the Proposed Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, Purchaser shall, within thirty (30) days after Purchaser's
receipt of the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet, notify the Seller
Representative in writing of such disagreement by setting forth Purchaser's
calculation of the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount as of the Balance
Sheet Time and describing in reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement
(an "Objection Notice"). If no Objection Notice is delivered on or prior to
the thirtieth (30th) day after Purchaser's receipt of the Proposed Closing
Balance Sheet, the Seller Representative's calculation of the Proposed Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to be binding on the parties
hereto. If an Objection Notice is timely delivered to the Seller
Representative, then Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve their disagreements with respect to the computation
of the Proposed Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount. In the event that
Purchaser and the Seller Representative are unable to resolve all such
disagreements within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Seller
Representative's receipt of such Objection Notice, Purchaser and the Seller
Representative shall submit such remaining disagreements to an independent,
nationally recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to Purchaser and the
Seller Representative (the "Auditor") for resolution.

  

  

(c) Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall use their respective
reasonable efforts to cause the Auditor to resolve all remaining disagreements
with respect to the computation of the Proposed Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount as soon as practicable, but in any event shall direct the Auditor to
render a determination within forty-five (45) days after its retention. The
Auditor shall consider only those items and amounts in Purchaser's and the
Seller Representative's respective calculations of the Proposed Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount that are identified as being in dispute between

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

Purchaser and the Seller Representative. In resolving any disputed item, the
Auditor may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for
such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by either party. The Auditor's determination of the Proposed Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount shall be based solely on written materials
submitted by Purchaser and the Seller Representative (i.e., not on independent
review) and on the definition of "Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount"
included herein. The determination of the Auditor shall be conclusive and
binding upon the parties hereto. As used herein the "Final Post-Closing
Adjustment" shall mean the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.4, and the "Final Closing Balance Sheet"
shall mean the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet as adjusted by (i) Purchaser and
the Seller Representative and/or (ii) the Auditor for any items that were
disputed pursuant to this Section 2.4.

  

  

(d) The costs and expenses of the Auditor (if any) in determining the Final
Post-Closing Adjustment shall be borne fifty percent by Purchaser, and fifty
percent by the Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers).

  

  

(e) Within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final Post-
Closing Adjustment:

  

  

(i) if the Final Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, the Seller
Representative and Purchaser shall give joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to promptly pay to an account or accounts designated by Purchaser
an amount (of which 45.595% shall be in cash and the remainder shall be in
Purchaser Common Stock) equal to the Final Post-Closing Adjustment; provided,
that Purchaser's right to payment under this Section 2.4(e)(i) shall be
limited solely to the Escrow Amount and Purchaser shall not have any claim to
any excess of the Final Post-Closing Adjustment or part thereof over the
Escrow Amount from the Seller Representative or any Seller; and

  

  

(ii) if the Final Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, Purchaser
shall promptly pay to Sellers an amount in cash and Purchaser Common Stock
(apportioned in the same manner as the Closing Consideration received by such
Sellers, assuming for these purposes the Sellers had also received the cash
delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Seller Representative at the Closing)
equal to the Final Post-Closing Adjustment in accordance with the Adjusted
Applicable Percentages set forth opposite such Sellers' names in the
Transaction Consideration Disbursement Schedule, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts designated by Seller
Representative.

  

  

(f) For purposes of calculating the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.2(a), Section 2.4 and Section 2.5, one
share shall be deemed to be valued at the average closing price of Purchaser
Common Stock for the ten trading days ending on February 6, 2015 (the "Stock
Price").

  

  

(g) To the extent there are any accounts receivable and taxes receivable
reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet that were not collected as of the
90 day anniversary of the Closing, but that were collected thereafter but on
or prior to December

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

31, 2015 (such receivables so paid, the "Late Paid Receivables"), then
Purchaser shall, promptly, but no later than January 10, 2016, pay to Sellers
an amount in cash equal to the Late Paid Receivables in accordance with the
Adjusted Applicable Percentages set forth opposite such Sellers' names in the
Transaction Consideration Disbursement Schedule, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts designated by the Seller
Representative. To the extent that any accruals for 401(k) matching
contributions reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet are not paid by the
Companies because an Employee is no longer in the employ of the Consolidated
Companies on the date when such contributions would have been made, then
Purchaser shall, promptly, but no later than January 10, 2016, pay to Sellers
an amount in cash equal to such accruals in accordance with the Adjusted
Applicable Percentages set forth opposite such Sellers' names in the
Transaction Consideration Disbursement Schedule, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts designated by the Seller
Representative.

  

  

(h) All payments made pursuant to Section 2.4 shall be treated by all parties
hereto for Tax purposes as adjustments to the Transaction Consideration.

  

  

Section 2.5 Earn-out Payment.

  

  

(a) Earn-Out Thresholds. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section
2.5, the Sellers shall be eligible to receive payment of additional
consideration consisting of the Earn-Out Cash Consideration plus, for Employee
Sellers the Earn-Out Stock Consideration, payable by Purchaser to the Sellers
in the amounts specified and in the manner set forth in Section 2.5(c) (any
such payment, an "Earn-Out Payment"), subject to and only upon the achievement
of a minimum of $80 million of CP Advisory Revenue by the Consolidated
Companies (such target, the "CP Advisory Revenue Target") during either of the
following periods:

  

  

(i) the twenty-four month period commencing on April 1, 2015 or, if later, the
Closing Date (the "First Earn-Out Period") or,

  

  

(ii) if the CP Advisory Revenue Target is not achieved in the First Earn-Out
Period, the period commencing on the first day following the end of the First
Earn-Out Period and ending on the twenty-four month anniversary of the last
day of the First Earn-Out Period (such period, the "Second Earn-Out Period").

  

  

For the avoidance of doubt, no more than one Earn-Out Payment will be made by
Purchaser, and, if the CP Advisory Revenue Target is not achieved in the First
Earn-Out Period, CP Advisory Revenues from the First Earn-Out Period shall not
carry over to the Second Earn-Out Period or otherwise be included in the
determination of whether the CP Advisory Revenue Target is achieved during the
Second Earn-Out Period.

  

  

(b) Earn-Out Statements. Within thirty (30) days following the end of the
First Earn-Out Period, and, if the Earn-Out Payment was not made in respect of
the First Earn-Out Period, within thirty (30) days following the end of the
Second Earn-Out Period, Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
will furnish to the Seller Representative (i) with respect to the First Earn-
Out Period, a detailed statement reflecting the

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

CP Advisory Revenue for such First Earn-Out Period and indicating whether any
Earn-Out Payment is due to the Sellers for such period, and (ii) with respect
to the Second Earn-Out Period (if applicable), a detailed statement reflecting
the CP Advisory Revenue for the Second Earn-Out Period and indicating whether
any Earn-Out Payment is due to the Sellers for such period (each such
statement, an "Earn-Out Statement"). Unless the Seller Representative, within
fifteen (15) days after receipt of an Earn-Out Statement, provides Purchaser
with a written notice objecting thereto and specifying, in reasonable detail,
the basis for such objection and the amount in dispute (an "Earn-Out
Objection"), such Earn-Out Statement shall be binding upon Purchaser and the
Sellers. The Seller Representative shall have reasonable access to the books,
records and other documents (including work papers) pertaining to or used in
connection with the preparation of the Earn-Out Statement and the calculation
of the Earn-Out Payment, and Purchaser shall provide the Seller Representative
with copies thereof (as reasonably requested by the Seller Representative), as
well as to personnel of Purchaser, the Companies and their Subsidiaries. In
the event there is a dispute between Purchaser and the Seller Representative
regarding an Earn-Out Payment or an Earn-Out Statement, the Seller
Representative timely provides Purchaser with an Earn-Out Objection, and such
dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days of receipt by Purchaser of the
applicable Earn-Out Objection, Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall
engage the Auditor to resolve the dispute in a manner consistent with the
provisions of Section 2.4.

  

  

(c) Earn-Out Payments. If an Earn-Out Payment becomes due and payable, (i) for
each Non-Employee Seller, any such Earn-Out Payment shall be made in cash in
the amount specified next to such Non-Employee Seller's name under the column
"Cash Consideration Paid if Earn-Out Achieved" on the Transaction
Consideration Disbursement Schedule, and (ii) for each Employee Seller, any
such Earn-Out Payment shall be made (x) partially in cash in the amount
specified next to such Employee Seller's name under the column "Cash
Consideration Paid if Earn-Out Achieved" on the Transaction Consideration
Disbursement Schedule, and (y) partially in Purchaser Common Stock, in the
number of shares specified next to such Employee Seller's name under the
column "Stock Consideration Paid if Earn-Out Achieved" on the Transaction
Consideration Disbursement Schedule. Any such cash payments shall be made by
Purchaser within five (5) Business Days following the final determination of
the Earn-Out Payment pursuant to this Section 2.5 by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account or accounts as the Seller
Representative specifies to Purchaser in writing within two (2) Business Days
following the final determination of the Earn-Out Payment pursuant to this
Section 2.5. Any such stock payments shall be made within five (5) Business
Days following the final determination of the Earn-Out Payment pursuant to
this Section 2.5 by Purchaser causing the transfer of the applicable number of
shares of Purchaser Common Stock in book-entry form to be issued in the name
of the applicable Employee Seller set forth in the Transaction Consideration
Disbursement Schedule. The Parties hereto understand and agree that the
contingent right to receive any Earn-Out Payment shall not be represented by
any form of certificate or other instrument, is not transferable, except by
operation of Legal Requirements relating to descent and distribution, divorce
and community property.

  

  

(d) Earn-Out Covenants. From the Closing Date until the end of the Second
Earn-Out Period (or, if the Earn-Out Payment is earned in the First Earn-Out
Period, the end of the First Earn-Out Period):

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

(i) Purchaser shall keep adequate books and records to the extent necessary to
enable the Seller Representative to fully review any Earn-out Statement;

  

  

(ii) within 30 days after the end of each quarter of the First Earn-out Period
and the Second Earn-Out Period (as applicable), Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to the Seller Representative a calculation of CP Advisory Revenue for
such quarter;

  

  

(iii) Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
take any action for the primary purpose or intent of adversely affecting, , in
any material respect, the opportunity of Sellers to receive the Earn-Out
Payment; and

  

  

(iv) Purchaser will operate the business of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries in good faith and consistent with Purchaser's business practices.

  

  

Section 2.6 Lock-Ups. Each Employee Seller covenants and agrees that such
Employee Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, sell, assign, pledge,
hypothecate or otherwise transfer (or enter into an obligation regarding the
future sale, assignment, pledge or transfer of) (each, a "Transfer") any
shares of Purchaser Common Stock (i) acquired as part of the Closing Stock
Consideration, on or prior to the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date or
(ii) acquired as part of the Earn-Out Stock Consideration, on or prior to the
12-month anniversary of the applicable Earn-out Payment Date (in each case,
the "Lock-Up Period"). Following the end of such Lock-Up Periods, any
Transfers of Purchaser Common Stock by Employee Sellers who remain employees
of Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries as of the date of any such Transfer
shall be made only in compliance with applicable law and Purchaser's generally
applicable trading policies and procedures for its employees. Each Employee
Seller acknowledges that the shares of Purchaser Common Stock delivered to
such Employee Seller pursuant to this Agreement shall have a legend evidencing
the Lock-Up Period restrictions (which legend shall be removed at the end of
the applicable Lock-Up Period). Prior to the end of the applicable Lock-Up
Period, Purchaser shall cause all shares of Purchaser Common Stock acquired by
Employee Sellers as part of the Closing Stock Consideration or the Earn-Out
Stock Consideration to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

  

  

Section 2.7 Seller Representative.

  

  

(a) Each Seller hereby authorizes and directs Stephen Sloan, as Seller
Representative, to act as the agent, proxy, attorney-in-fact and
representative for the Sellers and their successors and assigns for all
purposes under this Agreement, and the Seller Representative, by his signature
below, agrees to serve in such capacity.

  

  

(b) In his capacity as Seller Representative, the Seller Representative shall
have the power and authority to take such actions on behalf of each Seller as
the Seller Representative, in its sole judgment, may deem to be in the best
interests of the Sellers or otherwise appropriate on all matters related to or
arising from this Agreement. Such powers shall include, without limitation:
(i) the right to give and receive notices and other documentation pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, on behalf of the Sellers, (ii) amending and
waiving the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.12 and/or 12.13
hereof, (iii)

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

providing changes to the Transaction Consideration Disbursement Schedule, on
behalf of the Sellers, (iv) termination of the Agreement pursuant to Section
11.1 hereof, (v) incurring fees and expenses on behalf of the Sellers in
connection with this Agreement to be paid as provided herein and (vi) any
other actions contemplated by or in furtherance of this Agreement. All
actions, notices, communications and determinations by the Seller
Representative to carry out his functions shall conclusively be deemed to have
been authorized by, and shall be binding upon, the Sellers. The Seller
Representative shall be entitled to rely at all times on any directions
received from a majority in interest of the Sellers based on the Applicable
Percentages set forth in the Transaction Consideration Disbursement Schedule;
provided, however, that the Seller Representative shall not be required to
follow any such directions, and shall be under no obligation to take any
action in its capacity as the Seller Representative based upon any such
directions. The Seller Representative shall be entitled to engage such
counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as he shall deem necessary
in connection with exercising his powers and performing his functions
hereunder and shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and
advice of such Persons.

  

  

(c) The power of attorney appointing the Seller Representative as attorney-in-
fact is coupled with an interest and the death, incapacity, bankruptcy or
dissolution of any Seller shall not terminate or diminish the authority and
agency of the Seller Representative.

  

  

(d) The Seller Representative may resign at any time. Should the Seller
Representative resign or be unable to serve, a replacement Seller
Representative shall be appointed by a majority in interest of the Sellers
based on the Applicable Percentages set forth in the Transaction Consideration
Disbursement Schedule, upon prior written notice to Purchaser and each Seller.
The decisions and actions of any such replacement Seller Representative shall
be, for all purposes, those of the Seller Representative as if originally
named herein. The Seller Representative shall not be liable for any act done
or omitted as Seller Representative, except to the extent that the Seller
Representative engaged in willful misconduct. All fees and expenses, including
for attorneys, accountants and financial and other advisors, paying agents and
other persons and insurance, in each case necessary or appropriate and engaged
by the Seller Representative in the performance of its duties under this
Agreement shall be paid from the Expense Reserve or as otherwise provided in
Section 2.7(f), and the Seller Representative shall be indemnified in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.7(e). For the avoidance of doubt, neither
Purchaser nor the Companies have any liability or obligation to the Seller
Representative in respect of his fees, expenses, indemnities or other terms of
his engagement by the Sellers.

  

  

(e) The Sellers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Seller Representative and his heirs, representatives, successors
and assigns from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, actions,
causes of action, losses, damages, obligations, liabilities, costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) arising as a result of or
incurred in connection with any actions taken or omitted to be taken by the
Seller Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, except to the
extent it is demonstrated that the Seller Representative engaged in willful
misconduct. In addition, each Seller, on behalf of such Seller and such
Seller's successors, assigns and heirs, forever voluntarily releases and
discharges the Seller Representative, and his heirs, representatives,

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

successors and assigns from any and all claims, demands, suits, actions,
causes of action, losses, damages, obligations, liabilities, costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs), whether known or
unknown, anticipated or unanticipated, arising as a result of or incurred in
connection with any actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Seller
Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, except to the extent
it can be demonstrated that the Seller Representative engaged in willful
misconduct.

  

  

(f) Each Seller hereby authorizes Purchaser to pay at the Closing an aggregate
amount of $250,000 (the "Expense Reserve") to the Seller Representative, which
amount shall be deducted on a pro rata basis in accordance with the Applicable
Percentages set forth in the Transaction Consideration Disbursement Schedule
from the Closing Cash Consideration otherwise payable to the Sellers. The
Expense Reserve shall be retained by the Seller Representative in connection
with the performance of his duties and obligations under this Agreement, and
any amounts remaining from the Expense Reserve shall be paid by the Seller
Representative to the Sellers in accordance with the Applicable Percentages
set forth in the Transaction Consideration Disbursement Schedule at such time
as the Seller Representative determines in his sole discretion to be
appropriate. The Sellers shall not receive interest or other earnings on the
Expense Reserve. The Seller Representative shall have no responsibility or
liability for any loss of principal of the Expense Reserve other than as a
result of the willful misconduct of the Seller Representative. For tax
purposes, the Expense Reserve shall be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by the Sellers at the time of Closing. The Parties agree
that the Seller Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or in any
similar capacity in connection with the Expense Reserve. To the extent that
the Expense Reserve is insufficient to reimburse and/or indemnify the Seller
Representative as provided in this Agreement, the Seller Representative shall
have the power and authority to set aside and retain additional funds paid to
or received by it, or direct payment of additional funds to be made by the
Sellers (in which case the Sellers shall make such payments to the Seller
Representative and shall do so in accordance with the Applicable Percentages
set forth in the Transaction Consideration Disbursement Schedule), to satisfy
such obligations (including to establish such reserves as the Seller
Representative determines in good faith to be appropriate for costs and
expenses that are not then known or determinable). The relationship created
herein is not to be construed as a joint venture or any form of partnership
between or among the Seller Representative or any Seller for any purpose of
U.S. federal or state law, including federal or state Tax purposes. The Seller
Representative does not owe any fiduciary or other duty to any Seller.

  

  

(g) Each other Party acknowledges that the Seller Representative is a party to
this Agreement in his capacity as the Seller Representative solely for the
purpose of serving as the "Seller Representative" hereunder, and no claim
shall be brought by or on behalf of any other Party (or any of such Party's
Affiliates) against the Seller Representative (in his capacity as such) with
respect to this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or any certificate, opinion, instrument or
other document delivered hereunder or thereunder, except in the case of
willful misconduct by the Seller Representative. It is understood that any
covenant or agreement of or by the "Parties" or "each of the Parties" shall
not be deemed to require performance by, or be an agreement of, the Seller
Representative unless performance by the Representative is expressly provided
for in such covenant or the Seller Representative expressly so agrees.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

(h) Purchaser shall be able to rely conclusively on the actions, notices,
communications, determinations, consents or instructions of the Seller
Representative as to any actions, notices, communications, determinations,
consents or instructions taken or given by the Sellers under this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement, and may rely upon any such action, notice,
communication, determination, consent or instruction of the Seller
Representative as being the action, notice, communication, determination,
consent or instruction of each such Seller.

  

  

Section 2.8 Certain Adjustments to Purchaser Common Stock. If, at any time
during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, any
change in the outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall occur by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
exchange (including pursuant to a merger or consolidation) or readjustment of
shares, or any similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon (whether of
Purchaser Common Stock or of the securities of any other Person) with a record
date during such period, the Closing Stock Consideration payable to the
Sellers or the Escrow Agent under this Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the Sellers the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event. If, at any time during the period between
the Closing and the date on which the Final Post-Closing Adjustment is
determined, any change in the outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock
shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
or combination, exchange (including pursuant to a merger or consolidation) or
readjustment of shares, or any similar transaction, or any stock dividend
thereon (whether of Purchaser Common Stock or of the securities of any other
Person) with a record date during such period, any Purchaser Common Stock
payable to the Sellers pursuant to Section 2.4 shall be appropriately adjusted
to provide the Sellers the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event. If, at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the end of the First Earn-Out Period or the end of
the Second Earn-Out Period, as applicable, any change in the outstanding
shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall occur by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange
(including pursuant to a merger or consolidation) or readjustment of shares,
or any similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon (whether of
Purchaser Common Stock or of the securities of any other Person) with a record
date during such period, the Earn-Out Stock Consideration payable to the
Sellers pursuant to Section 2.5 shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the
Sellers the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event. In no event will Purchaser deliver any fractional shares to the
Sellers under this Agreement, and cash will be paid in lieu thereof with the
value of one share based on the Stock Price.

  

  

Section 2.9 Allocation of Purchase Price; Withholding.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 2.9(b), each of the Parties hereto agrees that, as set
forth in Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Revenue Ruling 99-6, for all U.S.
federal income Tax purposes (and, to the extent permissible by Legal
Requirements, state, local and non-U.S. Tax purposes), Purchaser shall be
treated as acquiring the assets of the Companies, the Sellers shall be treated
as selling their interests in the Companies, and each of the Companies'
classification as a partnership for U.S. federal income Tax purposes shall
cease. Prior to the Closing, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith and
agree on a reasonable

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

allocation of the Purchase Price to CP LP, CPE and CP CS for all U.S. federal,
state and local income Tax purposes.

  

  

(b) If Purchaser assigns all or part of its obligation to be admitted as a
member to CPE to one or more Affiliates pursuant to Section 12.11 that are
regarded as separate from Purchaser for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, then
(i) Purchaser and its Affiliate or Affiliates shall be treated as acquiring
partnership interests in CPE for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (ii) CPE's
classification as a partnership for U.S. federal income Tax purposes shall
continue, and (iii) CPE shall make an election under Section 754 of the Code
with respect to the taxable year in which the Closing occurs, or otherwise
certify that such election is in place for such year.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith and agree
on the amount of the Purchase Price that is required to be allocated among the
assets acquired as of the Closing Date that are described in Section 751 of
the Code. The Parties agree to act in accordance with such allocation for all
Tax purposes, including for purposes of the filing of any Tax Return, unless
otherwise required by Legal Requirements.

  

  

(d) Purchaser, the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, and Purchaser, the Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries shall deduct and withhold, any amounts they are
required to deduct and withhold pursuant to any provision of applicable Legal
Requirements in connection with any payments required to be made by Purchaser
or the Companies pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; provided, however,
that, if each Seller who is required to provide the certification pursuant to
Section 3.2(a)(iv) has provided such certification, and CP LP has provided the
certification required pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(v), then Purchaser, the
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries shall not deduct or withhold any

accelerate the payment, vesting or distribution of, any material compensation
or benefit (whether of severance, accrued vacation or otherwise) or increase
any material compensation or benefit or trigger any obligation to fund any
material compensation or benefit with respect to any current or former
Employee. No payment or benefit made pursuant to a Company Plan between any
current or former Employee and the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries as a
result, in whole or in part, of the transactions contemplated hereby could
reasonably result in the characterization of such payment or benefit as an
"excess parachute payment" within the

any disclosure of any such material confidential information or trade secrets

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

  

  

Except as disclosed in the Purchaser SEC Documents filed and made publicly
available on or after January 1, 2014 but prior to the date of this Agreement
(excluding any documents incorporated by reference therein, any disclosures
set forth in any risk factor section and any "forward-looking statement" (as
such term is used therein) and any disclosures or statements of similar
import), Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to the Companies and the
Sellers as follows:

  

  

Section 6.1 Authority; Organization and Qualification; Capitalization.
Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Legal Requirements of the State of Delaware and has the
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets
and properties and to conduct its business as it is now being or currently
planned by Purchaser to be conducted. Purchaser is duly qualified or licensed
to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
character of the properties owned, operated or leased by it or the nature of
the activities conducted by it make such qualification or licensing and good
standing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly qualified or
licensed and in good standing that could not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.
As of the date hereof, other than as set forth in the publicly available
Purchaser SEC Documents, there are no other outstanding (i) equity interests
or other securities of the Purchaser, (ii) securities of the Purchaser
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for equity interests or other
securities of the Purchaser or (iii) options, preemptive rights, stock
appreciation, phantom stock or profit participation rights with respect to, or
other rights to acquire from the Purchaser, or other obligations of the
Purchaser to issue, any equity interests or other securities or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for equity interests or other securities of
the Purchaser. Since December 31, 2014, Purchaser has not declared or paid any
extraordinary dividend on the Purchaser Common Stock.

Section 6.2 Enforceability; Authorization. This Agreement and each other
Transaction Document to which Purchaser is a party have been or will be duly
and validly executed and delivered by, and constitute or will constitute a
legal, valid and binding obligation of, the Purchaser, enforceable against
Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar Legal Requirements
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and each
other Transaction Document to which Purchaser is a party, and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate proceedings on the part of
Purchaser, and no other proceedings on the part of Purchaser, its stockholder
or its governing body are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents to which Purchaser is a party or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.3 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

  

  

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of this Agreement and
each other Transaction Document to which Purchaser is a party, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, do not and
will not: (i) conflict with or violate Purchaser's Charter Documents, (ii)
result in any material breach of or constitute a material default (or an event
that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a material default)
under, or materially impair the rights of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
or alter the rights or obligations of any third party under, or give rise to
any rights of termination, cancellation, modification, amendment or
acceleration of (whether after notice or lapse of time or both), or result in
the creation or imposition of an Encumbrance, other than a Permitted
Encumbrance or any Encumbrance created or imposed as a result of any financing
arrangement entered into by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on any of the properties or
assets of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, or (iii) conflict with or violate in
any material respect any Legal Requirements.

  

  

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser do not, and the
performance by Purchaser of its obligations hereunder will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Authority, except (i) the filing of any notifications
required under the HSR Act and the expiration of the required waiting period
thereunder; (ii) the filing of the 1017 Application with FINRA (and the
obtaining of the FINRA Approval, which is expected following the Closing);
(iii) the notification of the FCA in connection with the Acquisition, the
making any filings or applications with the FCA in connection with procuring
the satisfaction of the FCA Condition and the obtaining of the satisfaction of
the FCA Condition; and (iv) where the failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect or materially and adversely affect Purchaser's ability
to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents, or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 6.4 Purchaser SEC Documents and Financial Information; Internal
Controls and Procedures.

  

  

(a) Since the Reference Date, Purchaser has timely filed or otherwise timely
furnished all forms, documents and reports required to be filed or furnished,
as applicable, by it with the SEC, and Purchaser shall have timely filed or
otherwise timely furnished prior to the Closing Date all forms, documents and
reports required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC prior to such
time (collectively, the "Purchaser SEC Documents"). As of their respective
dates, the Purchaser SEC Documents complied (or shall comply, as the case may
be) in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, and
the Exchange Act, as applicable, and none of the Purchaser SEC Documents
contained (or shall contain, as the case may be) any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted (or shall omit, as the case may be) to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. None of Purchaser's Subsidiaries is required to file any
forms, reports or other documents with the SEC. As of the date of this
Agreement, no executive officer of Purchaser has failed in any respect to make
the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding
comments from, or material unresolved issue raised by, the SEC with respect to
any of the Purchaser SEC Documents.

  

  

(b) The financial statements (including all related notes and schedules) of
Purchaser included in the Purchaser SEC Documents have complied (or shall
comply, as the case may be) in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC in
effect at the time of the filing with respect thereto. Each of such financial
statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved, and fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial condition of Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the consolidated results of its
operations and its consolidated cash flows for the periods then ended.

  

  

(c) Purchaser maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
Purchaser's properties or assets. Since the Reference Date, none of Purchaser,
Purchaser's independent accountants, the Board of Directors of Purchaser or
its audit committee has received any oral or written notification of any (i)
"significant deficiency" in the internal controls over financial reporting of
Purchaser, (ii) "material weakness" in the internal controls over financial
reporting of Purchaser or (iii) fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees of Purchaser who have a significant role in the
internal controls over financial reporting of Purchaser.

  

  

(d) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Purchaser are reasonably
designed

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Purchaser in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Purchaser, as appropriate, to allow timely decision regarding
required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of Purchaser to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

  

  

Section 6.5 Compliance. Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries has complied
with in all material respects all, and is not in violation in any material
respect of any Legal Requirements applicable to Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  

  

Section 6.6 Litigation. There are no Proceedings pending, or, to Purchaser's
knowledge, threatened against Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of
their respective officers or directors) by or before any Governmental
Authority which has had, or is reasonably expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. There are no such
Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened, challenging
the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or seeking to enjoin or
prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or which would
otherwise reasonably be expected to result in a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect. Purchaser is not subject to any judgments, decrees, injunctions, or
orders of any Governmental Authority which have had, or are reasonably
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect or materially and adversely affect such Purchaser's ability to
satisfy its obligations under this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents, or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

  

  

Section 6.7 Issuance of the Shares. The shares of Purchaser Common Stock
constituting the Stock Consideration have been duly authorized and, when
issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Purchaser Common Stock, free and clear
of all Encumbrances, no current or past shareholder of Purchaser will have any
preemptive or similar rights in respect thereof and no personal liability will
attach thereto.

  

  

Section 6.8 Absence of Certain Changes; No Undisclosed Liabilities. From the
Reference Date to the date hereof: (a) the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, except for the negotiation,
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents; and (b) there has not been any change, effect, circumstance,
development or event that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have had, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.
Purchaser does not have any material liabilities or obligations, whether
accrued, absolute, fixed, contingent, or otherwise, whether due or to become
due, other than (i) liabilities that are set forth in the publicly available
Purchaser SEC Documents, (ii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business since the Reference Date that are not material in the aggregate and
(iii) liabilities under Contracts (other than in respect of a breach thereof).

Closing all funds necessary for the payment to the Sellers of the Closing Cash
Consideration and to pay all fees and expenses related to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

incurred, nor will any of them incur, directly or indirectly, any liability
for brokerage or finders' fees or agent's commissions or any similar charges
in connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby.

WARRANTIES IN THIS ARTICLE VI (OR THE PURCHASER CLOSING CERTIFICATE),

Section 8.1 Public Disclosure. From the date of this Agreement until the
Closing, Purchaser, the Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall
cooperate with each other in good faith to jointly prepare all press releases
and public announcements pertaining to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and, except as may be required by Legal Requirements, no
Party (or any Affiliate thereof) shall issue or otherwise make any public
disclosure or communication pertaining to this Agreement or transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior consent of Purchaser (in the case of the
Sellers or the Companies) or the Seller

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

Representative (in the case of Purchaser). Each Party will not unreasonably
delay, withhold or condition approval from the others with respect to any
press release or public announcement. This provision will not apply to
communications by any Party to its counsel, accountants, prospective debt
financing sources and other professional advisors.

  

  

Section 8.2 Confidentiality; Access to Information.

  

  

(a) Confidentiality. The confidentiality agreement dated March 7, 2013
previously executed by the Parties shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

  

  

(b) Access to Information. The Companies shall afford Purchaser and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, to the properties, books, records and executive and
financial personnel of the Companies and their Subsidiaries during the period
prior to the Closing to obtain all material information concerning the
business, as Purchaser may reasonably request. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, prior to Closing, the Companies shall (i) continue to
provide Purchaser and its advisors with updated financial information on a
reasonably prompt basis, and reasonable access to the Companies' financial
information used in the preparation of its Financial Statements, (ii)
reasonably cooperate with any reviews performed by Purchaser or its advisors
of any such financial statements or information and (iii) provide information,
on a reasonably prompt basis, of any changes in the professional personnel of
the Companies; provided that (x) any investigation pursuant to this Section
8.2(b) shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the conduct of the business of the Companies and their Subsidiaries and (y)
Purchaser shall not have access to personnel records of the Companies and
their Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation records,
medical histories or other information which in the Companies' good faith
opinion is sensitive or the disclosure of which could subject the Companies or
any of their Subsidiaries to risk of liability or loss of attorney-client
privilege. The Parties agree to the arrangements set forth in Schedule 8.2.

  

  

(c) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the
Companies shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser an estimated balance sheet of
the Consolidated Companies as of the Balance Sheet Time, together with the
Companies' good faith estimate of the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount
and the components of such calculation; such balance sheet and estimate will
be prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, based on the books
and records of the Consolidated Companies, in a manner and on a basis
consistent with the sample balance sheet and sample net working capital
statement attached as Schedule 2.4(a) hereto. For the avoidance of doubt, for
purposes of such estimate the Companies shall assume that all receivables will
be collected on or prior to the 90th day anniversary of the Closing Date. The
Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Purchaser
the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Consolidated Companies as of
December 31, 2014, together with such audited consolidated statements of
income and cash flows of the Consolidated Companies for the year then ended,
by March 15, 2015.

54  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

the Companies or their Subsidiaries (any such Person, a "Designated Person")
in any matter involving this Agreement, any other Transaction Documents or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, by any legal counsel
currently representing the Companies or the Subsidiaries in connection with
this Agreement, any of the other Transaction Documents or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (the "Current Representation").
Purchaser further waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause the
Companies and their Subsidiaries to waive and to not assert, any attorney-
client privilege with respect to any communication between any legal counsel
and any Designated Person occurring during the Current Representation in
connection with any Post-Closing Representation, including in connection with
a dispute with Purchaser, and following the Closing, with the Companies or
their Subsidiaries, it being the intention of the parties hereto that all such
rights to such attorney-client privilege and to control such attorney-client
privilege and attorney-client communications shall be retained by the Seller
Representative on behalf of the applicable Sellers; provided that the
foregoing waiver and acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any
communication not involving this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or to communications
with any Person other than the Designated Persons and their advisers.

  

  

(d) Nothing in this Section 8.3 shall release or discharge any Party from any
claim that such Party has breached any provision of this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document.

  

  

Section 8.4 Reasonable Efforts.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

(b) Without limiting Section 8.4(a):

  

  

(i) The Parties agree to act diligently and reasonably to provide information
and take such actions as to permit and cause the Companies to file or cause to
be filed, within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, the
1017 Application, and to respond to any communications from FINRA relating to
such filings, promptly file any additional requested information and take such
other actions as may be reasonably required to obtain the FINRA Approval

  

  

(ii) Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure the
satisfaction of the FCA Condition, including by: (A) as soon as reasonably
practicable, and in any event by no later than 10 Business Days following the
date of this Agreement, making the prescribed change in control applications
to the FCA in order to satisfy the FCA Condition; (B) responding promptly to
all inquiries and requests made by and provide all reasonable information
requested by the FCA with respect to the transactions notified to it, in
consultation with the Companies; (C) providing the

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

Company with an advance copy of the filings to be made with the FCA in order
to satisfy the FCA Condition, which filings will be redacted for any
information that is commercially sensitive and confidential to Purchaser; (D)
keeping the Companies informed of all material communications with the FCA in
respect of the FCA Condition; and (E) notifying the Companies of the
satisfaction of the FCA Condition or of any decision adopted by the FCA by no
later than the Business Day following Purchaser becoming aware of the same.

  

  

Section 8.5 Disclosure of Certain Matters. Each of Purchaser, the Sellers and
the Companies shall provide the others with prompt written notice of (i) any
material breach of such Party's representations and warranties in this
Agreement or (ii) any event, development or condition that (a) to such Party's
knowledge would cause any of such Party's representations and warranties to
become untrue or misleading in a material respect or which is expected to
materially affect such Party's ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (b) causes such Party to conclude that any
of the conditions set forth in Article IX will not be satisfied.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a breach of this Section 8.5
by any of the Parties shall not constitute a breach of a covenant applicable
to such Party for purposes of indemnification under Article X or for purposes
of Section 9.2(b) or 9.3(b).

  

  

Section 8.6 Employees and Benefits.

  

  

(a) Purchaser shall take all actions as provided in Schedule 8.6(a) at the
applicable times set forth therein.

  

  

(b) Through December 31, 2015 (the "Continuation Period"), Purchaser shall or
shall cause one of its Affiliates to continue to provide the employees of the
Companies or their Subsidiaries who remain employees of the Companies, their
Subsidiaries, the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates after the Closing (each,
a "Continuing Employee") with the same employee benefits that are provided
pursuant to the Company Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Closing;
provided, however, that to the extent a Company Plan may not be provided to
the Continuing Employees during the Continuation Period due to applicable
Legal Requirements, Purchaser shall or shall cause one of its Affiliates to
provide substitute benefits to the Continuing Employees under the employee
benefit plans and arrangements of the Purchaser and its Affiliates to the
extent such benefits are provided to similarly situated employees of the
Purchaser or its Affiliates. From January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016,
Purchaser shall or shall cause one of its Affiliates to provide the Continuing
Employees with employee benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate,
than the employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of the
Purchaser or its Affiliates.

  

  

(c) Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide to each
Continuing Employee full credit for such Continuing Employee's service with
the Companies or any of their respective Affiliates or their respective
predecessors prior to the Closing for all purposes, including for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and determination of the level of benefits (but, not for
benefit accrual purposes under a defined benefit plan), under any benefit plan
in which such Continuing Employee participates on or following the Closing to
the same extent recognized by the Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates immediately

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

prior to the Closing; provided, that such service shall not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or
coverage. Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to waive any limitation on health and
welfare coverage of such Continuing Employee due to pre-existing conditions,
waiting periods, active employment requirements, and requirements to show
evidence of good health under any applicable health and welfare plan of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to the extent such Continuing Employees
were covered under a similar Company Plan and (ii) to provide each Continuing
Employee with credit for any copayments and deductibles paid prior to the
Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deducible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any applicable plan of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

  

  

(d) Upon the written request of Purchaser to the Sellers at least five
Business Days prior to the Closing, effective as of immediately prior to the
Closing, the Companies shall terminate their defined contribution plan tax-
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the "Company 401(k) Plan"). If the
Company 401(k) Plan is terminated, Purchaser shall permit each Continuing
Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including all
participant loans) in cash or notes (in the case of participant loans) in an
amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the account
balance distributed to each such Continuing Employee from such plan to an
"eligible retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the
Code) of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Purchaser 401(k) Plan"),
subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchaser 401(k) Plan.

  

  

(e) All awards outstanding as of Closing under the Seller Equity Plans shall
(i) effective as of the Closing, vest in full, to the extent not yet vested,
and (ii) be distributed to the applicable award holder immediately following
the Closing (except to the extent distribution at such time would cause the
imposition of tax penalties pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, in which
case the distribution will be made at such time that will not cause the
imposition of tax penalties pursuant to Section 409A of the Code) in the
applicable amount determined by the Sellers in accordance with such plans.

  

  

(f) No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of
continued employment of any Continuing Employee and this Agreement shall not
be construed so as to prohibit Purchaser from having the right to terminate
the employment of any Continuing Employee after the Closing; provided that any
such termination is effected in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements.
This Section 8.6 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 8.6, express or
implied, shall confer any other Persons any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 8.6. Nothing contained herein,
express or implied, shall be construed to (i) establish, amend or modify any
Plan or other plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (ii) alter or limit
the ability of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any Plan or other plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any
time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them in
accordance with the terms of such Plan or other plan, program, agreement or
arrangement and applicable Legal Requirements.

Section 8.7 Antitrust Matters. Promptly after (but, at least within ten (10)
Business Days following) the execution of this Agreement, each of Purchaser,
on the one hand, and the Companies, on the other hand (or their respective
ultimate parent entities, if applicable), shall file the notification required
of it under the HSR Act in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and shall promptly and in good faith respond to all
information requested of it by the Federal Trade Commission and Department of
Justice in connection with such notification and otherwise cooperate in good
faith with each other and such Governmental Authorities. Each of Purchaser and
the Companies agree to request early termination of any waiting periods in
connection with such notification. Purchaser and the Companies shall (a)
promptly inform the other of any communication to or from the Federal Trade
Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) give the other
prompt notice of the commencement of any Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Authority with respect to such transactions, and (c) keep the
other reasonably informed as to the status of any such Proceeding. The fees
required to be paid in connection with the required notification under the HSR
Act shall be paid by Purchaser.

(a) Seller Indemnity. Each Seller shall severally and not jointly indemnify
and hold harmless Purchaser from and against, without duplication: (i) such
Seller's allocable share (based on such Seller's Applicable Percentage) of any
Taxes (other than any Taxes included in the determination of Final Working
Capital) imposed on or with respect to any of the Companies and any of their
respective Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (ii) any
Taxes imposed on or with respect to such Seller with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (including any Taxes imposed under Section 1445 of the Code
with respect to such Seller if such Seller did not provide a valid certificate
pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(iv) of this Agreement) and (iii) such Seller's
allocable share (based on such Seller's Applicable Percentage) of any Losses
incurred by Purchaser, any of the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries
attributable to or resulting from (A) the inaccuracy or breach of the
representations contained in Section 5.16(h) and Section 5.16(j), and (B) any
breach or non-performance of any covenant or agreement in this Section 8.8;
provided, however, that the liability under Section 8.8(a)(i) and Section
8.8(a)(iii) (combined with all other Losses paid or payable by such Seller
under Section 10.1(a) (other than, with respect to any such Seller, in respect
of any Seller Specified Representations of such Seller) and Section 10.1(b)
shall in no event exceed such Seller's Applicable Percentage of the Escrow
Amount, as set forth opposite such Seller's name on the Transaction
Consideration Disbursement Schedule, and the aggregate liability of the
Sellers under Section 8.8(a)(i) and Section 8.8(a)(iii) (together with all
Losses paid as payable by the Sellers under Section 10.1(a) and Section
10.1(b) (other than with respect to Seller Specified Representations) shall
not exceed the Escrow Amount. Purchaser shall have no claim against the
Sellers under Section 8.8(a)(i) and Section 8.8(a)(iii) other than for the
cash and Purchaser Common Stock, in each case, in the Escrow Amount. Purchaser
may also choose to (but is not required to) access the Escrow Amount if
entitled to payment under Section 8.8(a)(ii) from a Seller with respect to
Taxes imposed on or with respect to such Seller; provided, however, Purchaser
may not recover from the Escrow Amount with respect to such Seller in an
amount that exceeds such Seller's Applicable

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

Percentage of the Escrow Amount, as set forth opposite such Seller's name on
the Transaction Consummation Disbursement Schedule, taking into account all
other Losses paid or payable by such Seller under this Section 8.8(a), Section
10.1(a) (other than, with respect to any such Seller, in respect of any Seller
Specified Representations of such Seller) and Section 10.1(b).

  

  

(b) Tax Returns.

  

  

(i) The Seller Representative shall have the right and obligation to cause the
Companies to timely prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared and
filed, any Tax Return that is required to include the operations, ownership,
assets or activities of the Companies or their Subsidiaries for all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods on a basis consistent with prior practice unless otherwise
required by applicable Legal Requirements, and Purchaser shall authorize
Companies' officers to cooperate with respect thereto. Purchaser shall have
the right to review such Tax Returns, and the Sellers and the Seller
Representative will consider in good faith any comments provided by the
Purchaser. Purchaser shall have the right and obligation to cause the
Companies to timely prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared and
filed, when due, all other Tax Returns.

  

  

(ii) The Parties agree that, to the extent permitted under applicable Legal
Requirements, any deductions attributable to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the payment of Transaction Expenses, shall be
reflected in the Tax Return for the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  

  

(c) Straddle Period Tax Liabilities. Purchaser and the Sellers agree that if
the Companies and their Subsidiaries are permitted but not required under
applicable Legal Requirements to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a
Tax period, Purchaser and the Sellers shall so treat the Closing Date. Where
such treatment is not permitted, in the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall:

  

  

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (i) based upon or related to income
or receipts or (ii) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), be deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable year ended on the
Closing Date; and

  

  

(ii) in the case of Taxes not described in Section 8.8(c)(i) that are imposed
on a periodic basis and measured by the amount, value or level of any item, be
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in
the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such
Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire Straddle Period.

  

  

(d) Access to Books. The Companies, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the
other hand, agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the other Parties as
promptly as reasonably practicable, such information (including access to
books and records) and reasonable assistance (including the execution of
powers of attorney) relating to the

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

Companies and their Subsidiaries as is reasonably necessary for the
preparation and filing of any Tax Return contemplated by this Section 8.8 and
shall reasonably cooperate to cause a duly authorized representative to sign
such Tax Returns or otherwise provide the requisite powers of attorney.

  

  

(e) Amended Tax Returns. Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate to file amended
Tax Returns relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period (or the pre-Closing portion
of any Straddle Period) as reasonably requested by the Seller Representative
and shall not file any such amended Tax Returns in respect of such periods
without the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  

  

(f) Tax Refunds. Any Tax refund (including any interest in respect thereof)
received by Purchaser or any of the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries
that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period except for any such Tax refunds
specifically recorded as a receivable or other current asset in the
determination of Final Working Capital, shall be for the account of the
Sellers, and Purchaser shall pay over to the Seller Representative for
distribution to the Sellers any such refund (net of any (i) Taxes imposed on
Purchaser, any of the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries as a result of
the receipt of such refund and (ii) costs and expenses incurred by Purchaser,
any of the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries in obtaining such refund)
within ten (10) days after receipt. In the event that any refund is
subsequently denied by a Taxing Authority, the applicable Seller shall
promptly repay such refund (including interest) to Purchaser.

  

  

(g) Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other
fees and charges, including any penalties and interest ("Transfer Taxes")
incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be economically borne 50% by the Purchaser, and 50% by
the Sellers, with Sellers' portion being reflected as a Transaction Expense.
Purchaser shall file all necessary documentation and Tax Returns with respect
to such Transfer Taxes. Each Party shall reasonably cooperate with the other
Party in preparing and filing when due all necessary documentation and Tax
Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes and shall execute and deliver all
instruments and certificates reasonably required to obtain the benefit of any
available exemptions from or reduction in any such Transfer Taxes or to enable
the other Party to comply with any filing requirements relating to any such
Transfer Taxes.

  

  

(h) Purchase Price Adjustments. The Parties agree to treat any payment made
pursuant to this Section 8.8 or pursuant to Article X as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes unless otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements.

  

  

(i) Tax Audits.

  

  

(i) Purchaser shall promptly notify in writing upon receipt by Purchaser, any
of Purchaser's Affiliates or the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries, of
notice of any pending or threatened U.S. federal, state, local or foreign Tax
audits or assessments which may affect the Tax liabilities of the Sellers and
the Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries for which the Sellers
would be required to indemnify

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.8(a); provided, that failure to comply with
this provision shall not affect Purchaser's right to indemnification hereunder
except to the extent such failure results in an increase in the amount for
which the Sellers are liable under Section 8.8(a). The Parties shall fully
cooperate with each other in providing Tax information reasonably required in
connection with any audits or for other reasonable purposes.

  

  

(ii) Purchaser shall have the sole right to represent the Companies and their
Subsidiaries' interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding
relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, and to employ counsel of its choice and
at its expense. The Sellers shall have the right to participate in any such
audit or administrative or court proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser shall not be entitled to settle after the Closing Date, either
administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes
which would adversely affect in any material respect the liability for Taxes
of the Sellers or the Companies or their Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Periods without the prior written consent of the Sellers. Such consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, and shall not be
necessary to the extent that Purchaser has already been indemnified against
the effects of any such settlement.

  

  

(j) Assistance and Cooperation. The Seller Representative, on the one hand,
and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall cooperate (and Purchaser cause its
Affiliates to cooperate) with each other and with each other's agents,
including accounting firms and legal counsel, in connection with any
administrative or judicial proceeding in respect of Taxes assessed or proposed
to be assessed against any of the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries. Such
cooperation shall include each Party making all information and documents in
its possession relating to the Companies and their Subsidiaries available to
the other Party. The Parties shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules, and work
papers, and all material records and other documents relating thereto, until
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including, to the
extent notified by any Party, any extensions thereof) of the Tax period to
which such Tax Returns and other documents and information relate. Each of the
Parties shall also make available to the other Party, as reasonably requested
and available, personnel (including officers, directors, employees, and
agents) responsible for preparing, maintaining, and interpreting information
and documents relevant to Taxes, and personnel reasonably required as
witnesses or for purposes of providing information or documents in connection
with any administrative or judicial proceeding relating to Taxes. Any
information or documents provided under this Agreement shall be kept
confidential by the Party receiving such information or documents, except as
may otherwise be necessary in connection with the filing of income Tax Returns
or in connection with administrative or judicial proceedings relating to
Taxes.

  

  

(k) Expenses. Purchaser (or any of the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries)
shall bear the out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with audits and
other administrative and judicial proceedings relating to Taxes for which the
Sellers are not liable under this Agreement. Likewise, the Seller
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, shall be responsible for such out-
of-pocket expenses relating to Taxes for which the Sellers would be liable
under this Agreement.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

(l) Consistency. To the extent of any inconsistency between any provision of
Section 8.8 and Article X, the provisions of Section 8.8 shall control.

  

  

Section 8.9 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

  

  

(a) The Companies and their respective Subsidiaries shall, as applicable,
indemnify and hold harmless, and advance expenses to the respective past and
present directors, officers and managers of the Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries (collectively "DandO Indemnitees") to the same extent such DandO
Indemnitees are currently indemnified and entitled to advancement of expenses
under the applicable organizational documents of the Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries and, to the extent applicable, their employment
agreements in effect as of the date hereof, in each case for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall not, and shall
not permit any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or
modify any provision in such Company's or its Subsidiary's applicable
organizational documents relating to the exculpation or indemnification of
former officers and managers and/or directors as in effect immediately prior
to the Closing Date with respect to acts or omissions arising at or prior to
the Closing Date, except as may be required by Legal Requirements or except in
a manner no less favorable to such Persons. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Closing the Companies may
purchase directors' and officers' liability coverage and/or fiduciary
liability insurance policies; provided that the premiums or any other cost of
any such insurance shall be paid prior to the Closing and, to the extent not
paid prior to the Closing, shall constitute a Transaction Expense.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Section 8.9 shall survive the consummation of the Closing indefinitely. In the
event that any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or
assets to any Person, then, and in each case, the successors and assigns of
the Companies or their Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall be bound by the
obligations set forth in this Section 8.9.

  

  

Section 8.10 Further Assurances. From the date hereof until the earlier of the
Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article XI,
each of the Parties hereto shall execute such documents and perform such
further acts as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions hereof
and of each Transaction Document and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Companies and the Purchaser shall, on or prior to the Closing
Date, use their commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill or obtain the
fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the execution and
delivery of any documents, certificates, instruments or other papers that are
reasonably required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided that no Party shall be obligated to pay any money to
cure any breach of any representation or warranty.

  

  

Section 8.11 Termination of Affiliate Arrangements. Except as set forth in
Section 8.11 of the Companies Disclosure Schedules, each of the Sellers and
the Companies shall, and the Companies shall cause their Subsidiaries to,
immediately prior to the Closing,

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

execute and deliver such releases, termination agreements and discharges as
are necessary to (i) release and discharge such Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries) from any and all
obligations owed to the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries, (ii)
release and discharge any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries from any and
all obligations owed to such Seller or its Affiliates (other than the
Companies and their Subsidiaries) and (iii) terminate all arrangements,
commitments, contracts and understandings among the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries), on the one hand,
and the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries, on the other hand. Nothing in
this Section 8.11 shall release or discharge any Party from any claim that
such Party has breached any provision of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document.

Subsidiaries) and its and their Representatives, successors and permitted
assigns ("Purchaser Indemnitees") from and against all Losses incurred by any
Purchaser Indemnitee by reason of, arising out of or resulting from:

  

  

(i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of such Seller

contemplated hereby, including any claim that the Aggregate Consideration or
any other amount payable under this Agreement was not properly distributed to
such member or securityholder as a result of the assertion by it of any rights
under the relevant partnership or LLC Agreement or otherwise or any claim in
respect of fiduciary duties (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Proceeding brought (x) in such Person's capacity as an employee or former
employee of the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries and (y) under this
Agreement);

  

  

(iv) Transaction Expenses that remained unpaid as of immediately prior to the

Purchaser contained in this Agreement.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

Section 10.3 Defense of Claims.

  

  

(a) In the event that any Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee shall
incur any Losses in respect of which indemnification may be sought by such
party pursuant to this Article X, the party seeking such indemnification (the
"Indemnitee") shall assert a claim for indemnification by giving prompt
written notice thereof (the "Notice"), which shall describe in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances upon which the asserted claim for
indemnification is based, to the party providing indemnification (Purchaser or
the Sellers, as the case may be, the "Indemnitor") and, in the case of a
Purchaser Indemnitee, to the Escrow Agent, and shall thereafter keep the
Indemnitor reasonably informed with respect thereto; provided that failure of
the Indemnitee to give the Indemnitor prompt notice as provided herein shall
not relieve the Indemnitor of any of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent (and only to the extent) that the Indemnitor is actually and materially
prejudiced by such failure. In case any third party claim is asserted or third
party action or proceeding is brought against any Indemnitee in respect of
which indemnification may be sought by the Indemnitee pursuant to this Article
X (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnitor shall have the right to assume,
conduct and control the defense, compromise or settlement thereof, by written
notice to the Indemnitee of its intention to do so within thirty (30) days
after receipt of the Notice, at the Indemnitor's own expense, and thereupon to
prosecute in the name and on behalf of the Indemnitee any available cross-
claims, counter-claims or third party claims arising with respect to the Third
Party Claim; provided that, prior to the Indemnitor assuming control of such
defense it shall first confirm to the Indemnitee in writing that, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall be entitled
to indemnification in respect of such Third Party Claim; provided, that, the
Indemnitor shall not have the right without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim if such Third Party
Claim (i) relates to any actual or alleged criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation or (ii) seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against the Indemnitee that would reasonably be expected to
be material. If the Indemnitor shall assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim, (i) the Indemnitee shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with regards to such Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnitor and (ii) the Indemnitor shall not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
unless in the case of clause (ii), the judgment or settlement provides solely
for the payment of money by the Indemnitor (or, in the case of the Sellers,
the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Account for an amount less than the Escrow
Amount then in the Escrow Account), the Indemnitor makes (or instructs the
Escrow Agent to make) such payment (excluding, in all cases, any applicable
Deductible portion to be paid or borne by an Indemnitee under Section 10.4(c))
and the Indemnitee receives an unconditional release with respect to such
Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the assumption by the Indemnitor of the
defense of any Third Party Claim as provided in this Section 10.3(a), and
without limiting the Indemnitor's right to assume, conduct and control the
defense, compromise or settlement thereof, the Indemnitee shall be permitted
to join in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel at its
own expense; provided that if the Indemnitor assumes control of such defense
and the Indemnitee has been advised by counsel in writing that the Indemnitor
and the Indemnitee have an actual conflict with respect to such Proceeding,
the reasonable fees and

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

expenses of counsel to the Indemnitee solely in connection with such
Proceeding shall be considered "Losses" for purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) If the Indemnitor shall fail to notify the Indemnitee of its desire to
assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim within the prescribed thirty
(30) day period set forth in Section 10.3(a), or shall notify the Indemnitee
that it will not assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim, or if the
Indemnitor shall fail to conduct the defense of any such Third Party Claim in
good faith and at its expense, and such failure continues for more than ten
(10) days after written notice thereof from the Indemnitee to the Indemnitor,
then the Indemnitee may assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim in
the place of the Indemnitor by giving written notice to the Indemnitor, in
which event it shall act in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts
to conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnitor shall be
bound by any determinations made in any litigation with respect to such Third
Party Claim or any settlement thereof effected by the Indemnitee; provided
that any such determinations or settlement shall not affect the right of the
Indemnitor to dispute the Indemnitee's claim for indemnification under the
terms of Section 10.1 or Section 10.2; and provided, further, that nothing
shall prohibit the Indemnitee from taking any action required or reasonable
pending the Indemnitor informing the Indemnitee of its decision to assume or
not assume such defense.

  

  

Section 10.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Survival; Time Limitation. The representations and warranties, and the
covenants and agreements required to be performed or complied with prior to
the Closing, in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date ("Survival Period").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the representations and warranties of the
Sellers (or, in the case of Sections 5.4(a) and (b), the Companies) contained
in Section 4.1 (Authority; Organization and Qualification), Section 4.2
(Enforceability; Authorization), Section 4.3 (Title to the Units), Section 4.9
(Taxes) and Section 5.4(a) and (b) (Capitalization; Subsidiaries) (the
foregoing representations and warranties, the "Seller Specified
Representations"), (ii) the representations and warranties of the Companies
contained in Section 5.1 (Authority; Organization and Qualification), Section
5.2 (Enforceability; Authorization), Section 5.4(a) and (b) (Capitalization;
Subsidiaries), and Section 5.24 (Affiliate Transactions) (the foregoing
representations and warranties from the Companies, the "Companies Specified
Representations"), (iii) the representations and warranties of Purchaser
contained in Section 6.1 (Authority; Organization and Qualification;
Capitalization), Section 6.2 (Enforceability; Authorization) and Section 6.7
(Issuance of the Shares) (the foregoing representations and warranties from
Purchaser, the "Purchaser Specified Representations", and together with the
Seller Specified Representations and the Companies Specified Representations,
the "Specified Representations")), (iv) the covenants and agreements required
to be performed or complied with from and after the Closing (including Section
8.8) and (v) claims for Fraud of a Party (collectively, the "Surviving
Claims"), shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (or, in the case of covenants and agreements, for the
shorter period specified therein). No claim for indemnification under this
Article X shall be brought after expiration of the Survival Period, other than
claims for indemnification in respect of Surviving Claims.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

(b) Preservation of Claims. Any claim set forth in a Notice that has been
delivered in good faith in accordance with Section 10.3, and the foregoing
time frames, as applicable, shall survive until final resolution thereof.

  

  

(c) De Minimis and Deductible. No amount shall be payable under Section
10.1(a)(i), Section 10.1(b)(i) or Section 10.2(a)(i), as applicable, in
respect of any individual warranty breach (a "Warranty Breach"), other than a
Warranty Breach of a Specified Representation, unless the Losses from such
Warranty Breach exceed $10,000 (the "De Minimis Amount"). No amount shall be
payable under Section 10.1(a)(i), Section 10.1(b)(i) or Section 10.2(a)(i), as
applicable, in respect of any Warranty Breach, other than a Warranty Breach of
a Specified Representation, unless and until the aggregate amount of all
indemnifiable Losses arising from Warranty Breaches and otherwise payable to
the applicable Party or, in the case of the Sellers, Parties (disregarding,
for the avoidance of doubt, any Warranty Breaches in respect of which the
Losses did not exceed the De Minimis Amount) exceeds $200,000 (the
"Deductible"), in which event the amount payable shall include only Losses in
excess of the Deductible and all future amounts (disregarding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Warranty Breaches in respect of which the Losses did
not exceed the De Minimis Amount) that become payable under Section 10.1 or
Section 10.2 from time to time thereafter. With respect to indemnification by
the Sellers under Section 10.1(a)(i) and Section 10.1(b)(i), the Deductible
will be divided among the Sellers pro rata based on the Applicable Percentages
set forth in the Transaction Consideration Disbursement Schedule (for each
Seller, its "Sub-Deductible") and such Sub-Deductibles will be applied on a
Seller by Seller basis in respect of each Seller's applicable share of the
relevant Losses. Sellers will allocate among themselves on a pro rata basis
based on the amount of claims they would have recovered disregarding the
Deductible and Purchaser Limit any reduction of claims of Sellers resulting
from the Deductible and/or Purchaser Limit.

  

  

(d) Calculation of Losses; Duty to Mitigate. The amount of any Losses that are
indemnifiable under this Article X or Section 8.8(a) shall be net of any
amounts actually recovered by the Indemnitee under applicable insurance
policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor (less any
applicable deductibles, self-insured retentions, retroactive premiums,
increase in premiums or other amounts paid in connection with collecting such
amounts). If the Indemnitee actually receives any amounts under applicable
insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any
Losses, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnitor, then such
Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitor for any documented payment
made or expense incurred by such Indemnitor in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnitor, net of
any expenses incurred by such Indemnitee in collecting such amount. In no
event shall Indemnitee be required to commence a Proceeding in order to
satisfy its obligations pursuant to this Section 10.4(d). Each Indemnitee
shall use reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance
coverage, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible, for any Losses
payable under this Article X, in each case to the extent it is commercially
reasonable to do so, in the sole, reasonable judgment of the Indemnitee.

  

  

(e) Other Limitations. The Sellers shall not be liable under this Article X
for any Losses relating to any matter to the extent that such matter has been
taken

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

into account in the final determination of the Net Working Capital Adjustment.
No Indemnitor will be liable or otherwise responsible to an Indemnitee for any
consequential, indirect, incidental, punitive or other special damages
(including lost profits), except (i) in the case of Fraud of a Party and (ii)
to the extent such damages are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be payable by an Indemnitee to a third party.

  

  

(f) Aggregate Amount Limitation. The aggregate liability for Losses pursuant
to Section 10.1(a)(i) (other than, with respect to any such Seller, in respect
of any Seller Specified Representations of such Seller) and pursuant to
Section 10.1(b)(i) collectively shall not exceed the Escrow Amount, and
Purchaser shall have no claim against the Sellers other than for cash and
Purchaser Common Stock, in each case in the Escrow Account (other than, with
respect to any such Seller, in respect of any Seller Specified Representations
of such Seller). With respect to all Losses, other than Losses in respect of
Seller Specified Representations, Purchaser must seek recovery only from the
Escrow Account. The aggregate liability for Losses pursuant to Section
10.2(a)(i) (other than in respect of any Purchaser Specified Representations)
shall not exceed $7.2 million (the "Purchaser Limit"). Purchaser shall have
the right to either seek recovery directly against the appropriate Seller
Indemnitor or, subject to Section 10.4(g), the Escrow Account in connection
with Losses in respect of Seller Specified Representations.

  

  

(g) Seller Limitations. No Seller shall be liable (i) for Losses arising from
the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty, or the failure to
perform any covenant or agreement, by any other Seller or (ii) with respect to
indemnification under Section 10.1(b). No Seller will be liable for more than
such Seller's Applicable Percentage of Losses (set forth opposite such
Seller's name on the Transaction Consideration Disbursement Schedule) with
respect to (x) any indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1(b) or (y) any
indemnification in respect of the Capitalization Rep pursuant to Section
10.1(a)(iii). In order to achieve the foregoing, the Escrow Account will be
divided into sub-accounts (each a "Sub-Account") for each Seller, and, for the
avoidance of doubt, in the event the amount in any given Seller's Sub-Account
is insufficient to make full payment of such Seller's applicable portion of an
indemnity payment to be made, no amount may be taken from the Sub-Account of
any other Seller to satisfy such deficiency. In order to ensure that the
Purchaser Indemnitees not be disadvantaged by the order in which claims are
brought by virtue of the Sub-Account structure, if (A) a Purchaser Indemnitee
recovers any Losses in respect of a Seller Specified Representation from any
Seller's Sub-Account, (B) subsequent to such recovery, a Purchaser Indemnitee
becomes entitled to indemnification for Losses for which the Purchaser
Indemnitee's sole recourse would otherwise be limited (but for the operation
of this sentence) to the Escrow Amount ("Limited Recourse Losses") and (C) the
amount of such Limited Recourse Losses exceeds the amount then remaining in
such Seller's Sub-Account, then the Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to
recover directly from such Seller such excess amount up to the Outside Pool
Amount. As used herein, the term "Outside Pool Amount" means, at any given
time, (1) the total amount of Losses in respect of such Seller's Seller
Specified Representations which have been previously paid from Seller's Sub-
Account less (2) any amount previously paid directly (i.e. not from the Escrow
Account) by such Seller in respect of Limited Recourse Losses. For the
avoidance of doubt, a Purchaser Indemnitee shall always have the right, in its
sole discretion, to make a claim in respect of a Seller Specified
Representation directly against the applicable Seller(s).

Section 10.5 Release of Escrow Amount.

  

  

(a) Upon the final resolution of the amount of a Purchaser Indemnitee's Losses
in respect of any claim for indemnification under this Agreement for which
such Purchaser Indemnitee shall have delivered a Notice to the Sellers and the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (a "Pending
Claim"), the Seller Representative and Purchaser shall jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement to deliver to the pertinent Purchaser
Indemnitee the amount of such Losses resolved as payable from the Escrow Agent
to such Purchaser Indemnitee (subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article X, including Section 10.4(g)).

  

  

(b) On the second Business Day following the twelve (12) month anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall, with
respect to each Seller, issue a joint instruction, and the Escrow Agent shall
deliver to the Seller Representative (for distribution to such Seller) (i) the
Escrow Amount remaining in such Seller's Sub-Account minus (ii) the aggregate
amount of all Pending Claims then outstanding to the extent Losses in respect
of such Pending Claims are potentially payable from such Seller's Sub-Account.
The Escrow Agent shall retain in such Seller's Sub-Account an amount equal to
the aggregate amount of all Pending Claims outstanding to the extent Losses in
respect of such Pending Claims are potentially payable from such Seller's Sub-
Account (such Seller's "Indemnity Reserve Amount") until such claims are
finally resolved and the Escrow Agent receives notice to such effect pursuant
to joint instructions from Purchaser and the Seller Representative or until
release in accordance with Section 10.5(c).

  

  

(c) Following final resolution of any Pending Claim for which an Indemnity
Reserve Amount has been established with respect to a given Seller, the Seller
Representative and Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent under the
Escrow Agreement to deliver to the Seller Representative (for distribution to
such Seller) the excess of any Escrow Amount remaining in such Seller's Sub-
Account minus the sum of all such Seller's remaining Indemnity Reserve Amounts
in respect of Pending Claims then outstanding.

  

  

(d) Any release of a portion of the Escrow Amount to Purchaser shall consist
of (i) cash to the extent payable from the Sub-Accounts of Non-Employee
Sellers and (ii) Purchaser Common Stock to the extent payable from the Sub-
Accounts of Employee Sellers. The value of one share of Purchaser Common Stock
shall be deemed to equal the Stock Price.

  

  

Section 10.6 Exclusive Remedy. Each of Purchaser, on behalf of itself and all
other Purchaser Indemnitees, and each Seller, on behalf of itself and all
other Seller Indemnitees, hereby acknowledges and agrees that, from and after
the Closing, its sole remedy with respect to any and all claims for money
damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be pursuant and
subject to the requirements of the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article X. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing contained in
this Article X shall in any way impair, modify or otherwise limit Purchaser's
or any Seller's right to bring any claim against the other Party in accordance
with Section 12.8 based upon such other Party's Fraud, it

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

being understood that a mere breach of a representation and warranty, without
intentional and willful misrepresentation, does not constitute Fraud.

  

  

Section 10.7 Tax Matters. Other than Section 10.1(c) and Section 10.4, the
provisions of this Article X shall not apply to indemnification with respect
to matters relating to Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by Section
8.8.

  

  

Section 10.8 Seller Representative. The Seller Representative will act on
behalf of the Sellers for all purposes under this Article X.

  

  

ARTICLE XI 
 

  

  

TERMINATION

  

  

Section 11.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

  

  

(a) by mutual written agreement of Purchaser and the Sellers at any time;

  

  

(b) by either Purchaser or the Seller Representative if the Acquisition shall
not have been consummated by June 1, 2015 (the "Termination Date") for any
reason; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 11.1(b) shall not be available to any Party whose action or
failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the
Acquisition to occur on or before the Termination Date if such action or
failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

  

  

(c) by either Purchaser or the Seller Representative if a Governmental
Authority shall have issued an order, decree, judgment or ruling, in any case
having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Acquisition, which order, decree, ruling or other action is
final and nonappealable;

  

  

(d) by the Seller Representative upon a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Purchaser shall have become
untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Article IX would
not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become untrue; provided, that if such
breach by Purchaser is curable by Purchaser prior to the Termination Date,
then the Sellers may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.1(d)
for twenty (20) days after delivery of written notice from the Seller
Representative to Purchaser of such breach, provided Purchaser continues to
exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it being
understood that the Sellers may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 11.1(d) if any Seller or Company has materially breached this
Agreement or if such breach by Purchaser is cured during such twenty (20)-day
period); or

  

  

(e) by Purchaser, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Sellers or the Companies set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Sellers or the
Companies shall have become untrue,

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

in either case such that the conditions set forth in Article IX would not be
satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such representation
or warranty shall have become untrue; provided, that if such breach is curable
by the Sellers or the Company, as applicable, prior to the Termination Date,
then Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.1(e) for
twenty (20) days after delivery of written notice from Purchaser to the Seller
Representative of such breach, provided the Sellers or the Companies (as
applicable) continue to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such
breach (it being understood that Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 11.1(e) if it shall have materially breached this
Agreement or if such breach by the Sellers or the Companies is cured during
such twenty (20)-day period).

  

  

Section 11.2 Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination. Any termination of
this Agreement under Section 11.1 above will be effective immediately upon
(or, if the termination is pursuant to Section 11.1(d) or Section 11.1(e) and
the proviso therein is applicable, twenty (20) days after) the delivery of
written notice of the terminating Party to the other Parties hereto validly
terminating this Agreement in accordance with Section 11.1. In the event of
the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 11.1, this Agreement
shall be of no further force or effect and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be abandoned, except that: (i) Section 8.1 (Public Disclosure),
Section 8.2(a) (Confidentiality) and Article XII (General Provisions)
(excluding Section 12.6 thereof to the extent it relates to provisions that do
not survive) shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing
herein shall relieve any Party from liability for any knowing and intentional
breach of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.3 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses whether
or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated.

herein shall apply equally to the singular and plural forms of the terms
defined. Whenever the context shall require, any pronoun shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. When a reference is made
in this Agreement to an Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an
Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a

shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation."
Unless otherwise indicated, "as of the date hereof" shall mean "as of February
9, 2015." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. When reference is made herein to "the
business of" an entity, such reference shall be deemed to include the business
of all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such entity. Reference to the
Subsidiaries of an entity shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect

electronic data room (https://services.intralinks.com) or the Companies'
Netsuite system at least one (1) day prior to the date hereof or delivered to
Purchaser's counsel on the date hereof or as otherwise provided to Purchaser
in writing prior to the date hereof.

  

  

Section 12.3 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement and each other
document executed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and
the consummation thereof, may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same document and shall become effective
when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to the other Party, it being understood that all Parties need not
sign the same counterpart. Delivery by facsimile to counsel for the other
Party of a counterpart executed by a Party shall be deemed to meet the
requirements of the previous sentence.

  

  

Section 12.4 Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and
the documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Exhibits, Schedules, and
the Seller Consent Letter constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any
other Person any rights or remedies hereunder except for the DandO Indemnities
pursuant to Section 8.9 and the Indemnitees pursuant to Article X and Section
12.4, Section 12.8, Section 12.9, and Section 12.11.

  

  

Section 12.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement,
or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties hereto. The Parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

  

  

Section 12.6 Other Remedies; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties
hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.

  

  

Section 12.7 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

Section 12.8 Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process. Any legal action,
suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby may only be instituted in any state or
federal court in the State of New York, and each Party waives any objection
which such Party may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such action, suit or proceeding, and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction
of any such court in any such action, suit or proceeding.

  

  

Section 12.9 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION.

  

  

Section 12.10 Rules of Construction. The Parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Legal Requirement,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the Party drafting such
agreement or document.

  

  

Section 12.11 Assignment. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other Parties; provided, however, that Purchaser shall have
the right to assign all or a portion of its rights, interests and obligations
under and pursuant to this Agreement to any lender or other source of
financing to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (so long as any such
assignment shall not relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder and the
Sellers shall not be prejudiced thereby). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser may assign some or all of its rights, interests and obligations
under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Purchaser, but such assignment shall not relieve Purchaser of its obligations
hereunder and provided that the Sellers shall not be prejudiced thereby. In
the event of such an assignment, the term "Purchaser" shall be deemed to
include such Subsidiary for all purposes. Subject to the first sentence of
this Section 12.11, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

  

  

Section 12.12 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended only by the execution
of an instrument in writing manually signed on behalf of Purchaser, the
Companies and the Seller Representative.

  

  

Section 12.13 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, any Party
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

77  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

the obligations or other acts of the other Parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such Party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such
Party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party. Delay in exercising any right under
this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

  

  

Section 12.14 Disclosure Schedules. The Parties have set forth information on
their respective Disclosure Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to
the Section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one
section of a Disclosure Schedule need not be set forth in any other section or
with respect to any other Section of this Agreement so long as its relevance
to such other section of the Disclosure Schedule or Section of this Agreement
is reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed therein to the
Person to which such disclosure is being made. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that (a) the Disclosure Schedules may include certain items and
information solely for informational purposes for the convenience of the
Parties and (b) the disclosure by a Party of any matter in the Disclosure
Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by such Party
that the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or
that the matter is material.
