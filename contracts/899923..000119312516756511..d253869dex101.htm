1.8 Dissenting Shares.

 

(a) _Effect on Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder
who has made and perfected a demand for appraisal of such holders shares of
Company Capital Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and as of the
Closing has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost such holders right to
such appraisal (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the
applicable Merger Consideration, but shall be entitled to only such rights as
are granted by the DGCL. Parent shall be entitled to retain any Merger
Consideration not paid on account of such Dissenting Shares pending resolution
of the claims of such holders, and the Effective Time Holders shall not be
entitled to any portion of such retained Merger Consideration.

 

(b) _Loss of Dissenting Share Status_. Notwithstanding the provisions of
_Section 1.8(a)_, if any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who
demands appraisal of such holders shares under the DGCL shall effectively
withdraw or lose (through the failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders
right to appraisal, then as of the Closing or the occurrence of such event,
whichever occurs later, such holders shares of Company Capital Stock shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, promptly following the surrender
of the certificate or certificates representing such shares of Company
Capital Stock.

notice of any demands for appraisal of shares of Company Capital Stock

or notices served or otherwise delivered pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands for appraisal or other
instruments or notices. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal of shares of Company Capital Stock or offer to settle any such
demands.

(a) _Paying Agent_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit with

Effective Time Holders pursuant to _Sections 1.5(a)_ and _1.6_ (excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Adjustment Escrow
Amount and the portion of the Accelerable Escrow Deposit associated with
Effective Time Holders who have not delivered Joinder Agreements, Warrant
Surrender Agreements and/or Option Termination Agreements to the Parent at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, as the case may
be, all of which Escrow Amounts shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent, and
the Expense Fund, which shall be deposited with the Securityholders Agent).
The cash amount so deposited with the Paying Agent is referred to as the "
_Payment Fund_." The Paying Agent will be instructed to invest the funds
included in the Payment Fund in the manner directed by Parent and shall be
held in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the
Paying Agent Agreement. Any interest or other income resulting from the
investment of such funds shall be the property of, and will be paid to,

executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as Parent or
the Paying Agent may reasonably request, the holder of such Company Stock
Certificate shall, subject to _Section 1.9(h)_, if applicable, be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 1.5(a)_ at the time of such surrender, and the Company Stock
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. From and after the
Effective Time, each Company Stock Certificate which prior to the Effective
Time represented shares of Company Capital Stock shall be deemed to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if any, payable with
respect to such shares, and the holder of each such Company Stock Certificate
shall cease to have any rights with respect to the shares of Company Capital
Stock formerly represented thereby. Promptly following the Effective Time,
each holder of a Company Warrant who has executed and delivered
the applicable Warrant Surrender Agreement shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, if any,
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.6_.

 

(c) _Payments_. (i) On the Closing Date for each holder of Company Capital
Stock who has delivered a duly executed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying
Agent prior to the Closing Date and (ii) within three (3) Business Days
following the delivery of the Letter of Transmittal for each holder of Company
Capital Stock that delivers a duly executed Letter of Transmittal to the
Paying Agent after to the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be paid by the
Paying Agent to each such holder of Company Capital Stock the consideration
specified in _Section 1.5_, without interest. If payment of
Merger Consideration in respect of shares of Company Capital Stock converted
pursuant to _Section 1.5_ is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name a surrendered Company Stock Certificate is registered, it shall be
a condition to such payment that the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer
and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of
the registered holder of the Company Stock Certificate surrendered or shall
have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been
paid or is not payable.

 

(d) _Stock Transfer Books_. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall not be any further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock thereafter on the
records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, certificates for shares
of Outstanding Capital Stock (" _Company Stock Certificates_ ") are presented
to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration, if any, payable with respect to such shares as provided
for in _Section 1.5_. No interest shall accrue or be paid on any
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate.

(e) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Company Stock Certificate
representing shares of Outstanding Capital Stock shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the payment of any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
Company Capital Stock previously represented by such Company Stock
Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock
Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any affiliated party with respect to such Company Stock Certificate,
provided that no Stockholder shall be required to deliver a bond in respect of
such Company Stock Certificates.

 

(f) _Undistributed Payment Funds_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to Effective Time Holders as of the date that is one
hundred eighty (180) days after the date of this Agreement shall be delivered
to Parent upon demand, and Effective Time Holders who have not theretofore
received their Merger Consideration in accordance with  _Section 1.5_ and
_1.6_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims
for the Merger Consideration.

(g) _Escheat_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Parent nor any other Person shall be liable to any Effective Time
Holder or to any other Person for any amount paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar
applicable Legal Requirement. Any Merger Consideration or other amounts
remaining unclaimed by Effective Time Holders five (5) years after the
Effective Time for payments to be made in connection with the Closing or such
other relevant payment date for Further Distributions (or such earlier date
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of Parent free and clear
of any Encumbrance.

 

(h) _Withholding_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to (1) deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement (including all amounts to be
deposited into the Escrow Account in accordance with _Section 1.5(c)_) such
amounts as Parent is required to deduct or withhold under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law and (2) be provided any
reasonably requested Tax forms, including IRS Form W-9 (or any successor form)
or the appropriate IRS Form W-8 (or successor form), as applicable, or any
similar information from the Effective Time Holder and, to the extent required
by applicable Tax Legal Requirements, any beneficial owner of any interest in
any of the Effective Time Holder. To the extent such amounts are so deducted
or withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person on behalf of which such deduction or withholding was
made. Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation will cooperate in
good faith, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Paying
Agent to agree in the Paying Agent Agreement that it will cooperate in good
faith, with reasonable written requests from any Effective Time Holder
concerning reduction of or relief from potential deduction or withholding of
Tax; provided that such Effective Time Holder shall be responsible for any and
all costs and expenses that may be incurred by the Paying Agent, Parent, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation; and provided further for the avoidance
of doubt, that nothing in this _Section 1.9(h)_ shall be construed in any way
as undermining the ability of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company and the
Surviving Corporation to make such deduction or withholding, have such amount
be treated as paid to the Person on behalf of which such deduction or
withholding was made or otherwise limit any rights of any Indemnitee as set
forth in _Sections 6_ and _10_.

1.10 Post-Closing Adjustment to Purchase Price.

 

(a) _Calculation_. As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than
sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Parent shall (i) prepare or cause
to be prepared in accordance with GAAP, using the policies, conventions,
methodologies and procedures used by the Company in preparing the Company
Financial Statements, an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company
as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date
(the " _Parent Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together with a statement (the "
_Parent Closing Date Schedule_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail Parents
calculation of the Net Working Capital Amount and the Closing Net Indebtedness
Amount, and (ii) deliver to the Securityholders Agent the Parent Closing
Balance Sheet and the Parent Closing Date Schedule.

 

(b) _Review/Disputes_.

 

(i) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall provide the Securityholders Agent and any accountants, attorneys or
advisors retained by the Securityholders Agent with reasonable access, during
normal business hours, to the relevant books and records of the Surviving
Corporation used by Parent in the preparation of,

or otherwise reasonably relevant to, the Parent Closing Balance Sheet and the
Parent Closing Date Schedule. If the Securityholders Agent disputes the
calculation of the Net Working Capital Amount or the Closing Net Indebtedness
Amount set forth in the Parent Closing Balance Sheet or the Parent Closing
Date Schedule, then the Securityholders Agent shall deliver a written
notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to Parent at any time during the thirty (30)
day period commencing upon receipt by the Securityholders Agent of the Parent
Closing Balance Sheet and the Parent Closing Date Schedule (the " _Review
Period_ "). The Dispute Notice shall set forth the basis for the dispute of
any such calculation in reasonable detail.

 

(ii) If the Securityholders Agent does not deliver a Dispute Notice to Parent
prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the Surviving Corporations
calculation of the Net Working Capital Amount and the Closing Net Indebtedness
Amount set forth in the Parent Closing Balance Sheet and the Parent Closing
Date Schedule shall be deemed final and binding on Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Securityholders Agent and the Effective Time Holders for
purposes of this _Section 1.10_.

 

(iii) If the Securityholders Agent delivers a Dispute Notice to Parent prior
to the expiration of the Review Period, then the Securityholders Agent and
Parent shall negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on the Net Working
Capital Amount and/or the Closing Net Indebtedness Amount, as applicable,
within the thirty (30) day period commencing upon receipt by Parent of the
Dispute Notice. If the Securityholders Agent and Parent are unable to reach
agreement on the Net Working Capital Amount and the Closing Net Indebtedness
Amount within such thirty (30) day period, then either Parent or the
Securityholders Agent may submit the unresolved objections to KPMG LLP, or if
such accounting firm is unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, an
independent, national accounting firm reasonably acceptable to both
Parent and the Securityholders Agent (such firm, and any successor thereto,
being referred to herein as the " _Accounting Firm_ "), and such Accounting
Firm shall be directed by Parent and the Securityholders Agent to resolve
the unresolved objections in accordance with the immediately following
sentence. In connection with the resolution of any such dispute by the
Accounting Firm: (A) each of Parent and the Securityholders Agent shall have
a reasonable opportunity to meet with the Accounting Firm to provide their
views as to any disputed issues with respect to the calculation of the Net
Working Capital Amount and the Closing Net Indebtedness Amount, as applicable,
(B) the Accounting Firm shall determine the Net Working Capital Amount and
the Closing Net Indebtedness Amount, as applicable, in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event, within thirty (30) days of its engagement) and upon reaching such
determination shall deliver a copy of its calculations (the " _Expert
Calculations_ ") to the Securityholders Agent and Parent and (C) the
determination made by the Accounting Firm of the Net Working Capital Amount
and the Closing Net Indebtedness Amount, as applicable, shall be final and
binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Securityholders Agent and
the Effective Time Holders for purposes of this  _Section 1.10_, absent
manifest error. In calculating the Net Working Capital Amount and the Closing
Net Indebtedness Amount, as applicable, the Accounting Firm (x) shall be
limited to addressing the particular disputes referred to in the Dispute
Notice and (y) for each component of the Net Working Capital Amount and the
Closing Net Indebtedness Amount, as applicable, such calculation shall, with
respect to any disputed item, be no greater than the higher amount
calculated by the Securityholders Agent or Parent, and no less than the
lower amount calculated by the Securityholders Agent or Parent, as the case
may be. The Expert Calculations shall reflect in detail the differences, if
any, between the Net Working Capital Amount and the Closing Net Indebtedness
Amount, as applicable, reflected therein and the Net Working Capital Amount
and the Closing Net Indebtedness Amount, as applicable, set forth in the
Parent Closing Balance

Accounting Firm shall be paid by the prevailing party and non-
prevailing party, as determined by the Accounting Firm, in inverse proportion
with the extent to which the prevailing party prevails on an aggregate basis
based on the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute.

 

(c) _Payment upon Final Determination of Adjustments_.

 

(i) If (A) the Net Working Capital Amount as finally determined in accordance
with _Section 1.10(b)_ is less than (B) the Estimated Net Working Capital
Amount (the positive amount of such difference, the " _Working Capital
Shortfall_ ") by more than $250,000, then Parent and the Securityholders
Agent shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release from the Adjustment Escrow
an amount in cash equal to the Working Capital Shortfall and pay such amount
by delivery of immediately available funds to Parent. If the Working Capital
Shortfall exceeds the amount remaining in the Adjustment Escrow (the positive
amount of such difference, the " _Working Capital Escrow Shortfall_ "), then
Parent and Securityholders Agent shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release
from the Indemnity Escrow an amount equal to such Working Capital Escrow
Shortfall and pay such amount by delivery of immediately available funds to
Parent.

(ii) If (A) the Net Working Capital Amount as finally determined in
accordance with _Section 1.10(b)_ is greater than (B) the Estimated Net
Working Capital Amount (the positive amount of such difference, the "
_Working Capital Surplus_ ") by more than $250,000, then Parent shall pay an
amount equal to the Working Capital Surplus, less any amounts paid pursuant to
the Post-Closing Date Transaction Bonuses and payable as a result of the
payments of such Working Capital Surplus, to the Paying Agent, and cause the
Paying Agent to pay to each participating Effective Time Holder by delivery of
immediately available funds such Effective Time Holders aggregate Further
Distribution Per Share Amount of the Working Capital Surplus.

(iii) If (A) the Closing Net Indebtedness Amount as finally determined
in accordance with _Section 1.10(b)_ is greater than (B) the Estimated
Closing Net Indebtedness Amount (the positive amount of such difference, the "
_Closing Net Indebtedness Shortfall_ "), then Parent and the Securityholders
Agent shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Parent from the Adjustment
Escrow an amount in cash equal to the Closing Net Indebtedness Shortfall. If
the Closing Net Indebtedness Shortfall exceeds the amount remaining in the
Adjustment Escrow (the positive amount of such difference, the " _Net
Indebtedness Escrow Shortfall_ "), then Parent and Securityholders Agent
shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release from the Indemnity Escrow an
amount equal to such Net Indebtedness Escrow Shortfall and pay such amount by
delivery of immediately available funds to Parent.

 

(iv) If (A) the Closing Net Indebtedness Amount as finally determined in
accordance with  _Section 1.10(b)_ is less than (B) the Estimated Closing
Net Indebtedness Amount (the positive amount of such difference, the " _Net
Indebtedness Underpayment_ "), then Parent shall, no later than two (2)
Business Days after such determination (or, if any Effective Time Holder has
not exchanged such Effective Time Holders Company Stock Certificates pursuant
to _Section 1.9_, then upon such exchange by such Effective Time Holder),
fund the Paying Agent and cause the Paying Agent to pay to each participating
Effective Time Holder by delivery of immediately available funds such
Effective Time Holders aggregate Further Distribution Per Share Amount of the
Net Indebtedness Underpayment, less any amounts paid pursuant to the Post-
Closing Date Transaction Bonuses and payable as a result of the payment of
such Net Indebtedness Underpayment.

(v) After the final determination of the Closing Net Indebtedness Amount and
Net Working Capital Amount in accordance with _Section 1.10(b)_, within two
(2) Business Days following the payment of any amounts required pursuant to
clause (i) through (iii) of this _Section 1.10(c)_, Parent and
Securityholders Agent shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release from the
Adjustment Escrow the amount then remaining in the Adjustment Escrow, if any,
and pay such amount to the Paying Agent for distribution to the participating
Effective Time Holders in accordance with each such Effective Time Holders
aggregate Further Distribution Per Share Amount of the amount then remaining
in the Adjustment Escrow, less any amounts paid pursuant to the Post-Closing
Date Transaction Bonuses and payable as a result of such release from the
Adjustment Escrow.

(d) Nothing in this _Section 1.10_ shall limit any rights of any Indemnitee
as set forth in _Sections 6_ or _10_.

1.11 Earnout Payments.

 

(a) _Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment_. If Company Net Revenue for calendar
year 2017 (" _2017 Company Net Revenue_ ") exceeds Company Net Revenue for
calendar year 2016 (" _2016 Company Net Revenue_ "), then Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the Effective Time Holders in
accordance with this  _Section 1.11_ an amount equal to the difference
between the product of (i) [***] (the " _Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment_
"), and (ii) any amounts paid pursuant to the Post-Closing Date Transaction
Bonuses (including the employer portion of any payroll taxes thereon) payable
as a result of achievement of the Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment;
_provided, however_ , that the sum of the Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment
_plus_ any amounts paid pursuant to the Post-Closing Date Transaction Bonuses
(including the employer portion of any payroll taxes thereon) payable as a
result of achievement of the Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment shall in no
event exceed $85,000,000.

 

(i) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to calculate, and shall cause
its outside auditors to complete a review of, the Company Net Revenue of the
Surviving Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2017 no later than
February 15, 2018. Upon completion of such review, Parent shall deliver to the
Securityholders Agent a certificate (the " _Company Net Revenue Earnout
Certificate_ ") stating the auditor-reviewed Company Net Revenue for the
Surviving Corporation for calendar years 2016 and 2017 and setting forth the
calculation of the Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment in reasonable detail,
together with reasonable supporting information.

(ii) The Securityholders Agent and its representatives and advisers shall be
entitled to examine and have reasonable access to the books, records and
supporting information of Parent and the Surviving Corporation relating to the
calculation of the Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment. Within thirty (30)
days after receipt by the Securityholders Agent of the Company Net Revenue
Earnout Certificate, the Securityholders Agent may deliver to Parent a
written notice (the " _Earnout Calculation Notice_ ") either (i) advising
Parent that the Securityholders Agent agrees with and accepts the Company Net
Revenue Earnout Certificate or (ii) setting forth an explanation in reasonable
detail of those items in the Company Net Revenue Earnout Certificate that the
Securityholders Agent disputes and of what the Securityholders Agent
believes is the correct calculation of the Company Net Revenue Earnout
Payment. The Securityholders Agent and the accountants engaged by the
Securityholders Agent shall be entitled to review Parents and the Surviving
Corporations working papers and similar materials for purposes of reviewing
the Company Net Revenue Earnout Certificate. If the Securityholders

Agent does not submit an Earnout Calculation Notice within the 30-day period
provided herein, then the Company Net Revenue Earnout Certificate shall
become final and shall not be subject to further review, challenge or
adjustment, absent fraud or manifest error. Parent and its accountants shall
be entitled to review the working papers and similar materials relating to
the Securityholders Agent preparation of its Earnout Calculation Notice. If
Parent shall concur with the Earnout Calculation Notice, or if Parent shall
not object to the Earnout Calculation Notice in a writing received by the
Securityholders Agent within 30 days after Parents receipt of the Earnout
Calculation Notice, the calculation of the Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment
set forth in the Earnout Calculation Notice shall become final and shall not
be subject to further review, challenge or adjustment, absent fraud or
manifest error.

(iii) In the event that the Securityholders Agent and Parent are unable to
resolve any disputes regarding the Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment within
30 days after the date of Parents objection to the Earnout Calculation
Notice, then such disputes shall be referred to the Accounting Firm and the
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final and shall not be subject
to further review, challenge or adjustment, absent fraud or manifest error.
The Accounting Firm shall determine the Earnout Amount and shall be instructed
by Parent and the Securityholders Agent to use their reasonable best efforts
to reach such determination not more than 30 days after such referral. Nothing
herein shall be construed to authorize or permit the Accounting Firm to
resolve any item in dispute by making an adjustment to the Company Net
Revenue Earnout Certificate that is outside of the range for such item defined
by the Company Net Revenue Earnout Certificate and the Earnout Calculation
Notice. In calculating the Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment, the
Accounting Firm shall be limited to addressing any particular disputes
referred to in the Earnout Calculation Notice. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be paid by the prevailing party and non-
prevailing party, as determined by the Accounting Firm, in inverse proportion
with the extent to which the prevailing party prevails on an aggregate basis
based on the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute.

 

(iv) If such calculation results in a Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment
being payable to the Effective Time Holders, then within three (3) Business
Days following the final determination of the Company Net Revenue Earnout
Payment in accordance with this _Section 1.11(a)_, Parent shall pay, or cause
the Surviving Corporation to pay, the Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment to
the Effective Time Holders in accordance with _Section 1.11(c)_.

(v) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to: (A) continue
the separate existence of the Surviving Corporation as a stand-alone business
through at least December 31, 2017, (B) use commercially reasonable efforts to
achieve the greatest Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment reasonably
attainable through the application of funding, staffing and other resources
(taking into account sales productivity and metrics), (C) provide the
Securityholders Agent with a quarterly report within fifteen (15) days
following the end of each calendar quarter through December 31, 2017
summarizing in reasonable detail all material developments and circumstances
relating to the achievement of the Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment,
including the number of units of GeneSight or other products sold by the
Surviving Corporation in the period covered by such report, as well as the
Company Net Revenue during such period, (D) upon reasonable notice and at a
reasonable time following delivery of each such quarterly report, make
available the relevant members of management to meet with the Securityholders
Agent and its Representatives to discuss and respond to questions from them
with respect to such quarterly report, (E) maintain books and records in
accordance

with commercially reasonable business and accounting practices and in a manner
necessary for the Surviving Corporation to calculate Company Net Revenue for
calendar years 2016 and 2017, and (F) not take (or fail to take) any action
the primary intent or purpose of which is avoiding, frustrating or reducing
the amount of the Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment.

 

(vi) Subject to the limitations at the end of this Section 1.11 (a)(vi), in
addition to the definition of Company Net Revenue in Exhibit A, for purposes
of determining Company Net Revenue and the Company Net Revenue Earnout
Payment: (A) any revenue recognized by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent,
including the Surviving Corporation, resulting from the acquisition,
development or sale of a product that is competitive with GeneSight testing
shall be treated as Company Net Revenue generated from the sale of the
GeneSight testing; (B) any revenue recognized by Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent, including the Surviving Corporation, resulting from the sale of any
product other than GeneSight testing generated by or attributable to sales
personnel of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries shall be treated as
Company Net Revenue generated from the sale of the GeneSight testing; and (C)
any GeneSight testing revenue shall be treated as Company Net Revenue.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, (x) any GeneSight sales revenue or other
revenue generated by or attributable to sales personnel of Parent or its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) in calendar year 2016 shall not
be treated as Company Net Revenue; and (y) any GeneSight testing revenue
generated by or attributable to sales personnel of the Parent, or any
Subsidiary of Parent other than Surviving Corporation, to health care
providers in family or internal medicine practices (" _Primary Care Providers_
") who are not customers of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Date or who are not being actively pursued or targeted as a customer by the
Surviving Corporation within 45 days after either (i) an expansion of the
Medicare Local Coverage Determination to include Primary Care Providers
or (ii) other coverage decisions by additional payers that provide
reimbursement for tests ordered by Primary Care Providers shall not be treated
as Company Net Revenue.

 

(b) _Milestone Earnout Payment_.

 

(i) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to complete the Companys ongoing
prospective clinical utility study (ID Number ARX1006) (the " _Study_ ") in
accordance with the study design in effect on the date hereof. If the
Surviving Corporation achieves the main conclusion of the primary endpoint
for the Study, which shall mean a statistically significant (p value < .05)
improvement ( _i.e._ , the main conclusion calculated in accordance with the
first paragraph of Section 5.1 of the statistical analysis plan attached
hereto as _Schedule 1.11(b)_ , subject to _Section 1.11(b)(ii)_ below) in
depressive symptoms between baseline and week 8 as measured on the Hamilton
D17 scale for GeneSight-guided treatment versus treatment-as-usual (the "
_Milestone_ "), Parent shall pay or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to
the Effective Time Holders an amount equal to the difference between (i) $100
million in cash (the " _Milestone Earnout Payment_ ") and (ii) any amounts
paid pursuant to the Post-Closing Date Transaction Bonuses (including the
employer portion of any payroll taxes thereon) and payable as a result of
achievement of the Company Milestone Earnout Payment, which amount shall
be paid within three (3) Business Days following the successful achievement
of the Milestone. For avoidance of doubt, (x) only successful achievement of
the "main conclusion" of the primary endpoint described in the first
paragraph of Section 5.1 of the statistical analysis plan attached hereto as
_Schedule 1.11(b)_ shall constitute successful achievement of the Milestone
that gives rise to an obligation to pay the Milestone Earnout Payment and (y)
successful achievement of any "additional analyses" of the primary endpoint
described in the second paragraph of Section 5.1 of

the statistical analysis plan attached hereto as _Schedule 1.11(b)_ shall
neither constitute successful achievement of the Milestone nor give rise to
an obligation to pay the Milestone Earnout Payment. The complete finalized
statistical programming code to execute the statistical analysis for the main
conclusion (as defined in the first paragraph of Section 5.1 of
the statistical analysis plan including both parametric Analysis of
Covariance and non-parametric Rank Analysis of Covariance options) will be
locked and submitted to Parent at least five (5) Business Days before data un-
blinding. In addition, the complete and final analyzable final data file(s)
containing all the information needed to execute this analysis except for the
indicator for the treatment group will be locked and submitted to Parent at
least five (5) Business Days before data un-blinding. Immediately after un-
blinding, the complete and final analyzable final data file(s), containing all
the information needed to execute this analysis will be submitted to Parent.
Each of the Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment and the Milestone Earnout
Payment are referred to herein as an " _Earnout Payment_ " and together as the
" _Earnout Payments_." From the Effective Time through the completion of the
Study, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, (A) continue
the separate existence of the Surviving Corporation as a stand-alone business,
(B) provide sufficient funding, staffing and resources for the Surviving
Corporation to achieve a full read-out no later than November 1, 2017 and (C)
not take (or fail to take) any action the primary purpose or intent of which
is avoiding, frustrating or reducing the Surviving Corporations ability to
achieve the Milestone.

 

(ii) Parent and the Securityholders Agent shall mutually agree on the method
of primary efficacy analysis pursuant to Section 5.1 of _Schedule 1.11(b)_
(either parametric or non-parametric). In the event that Parent and the
Securityholders Agent are unable to agree on such method within thirty (30)
days, then such dispute shall be referred to an independent third party
mutually agreeable to Parent and the Securityholders Agent. The determination
of such third party shall be final and shall not be subject to further review,
challenge or adjustment, absent fraud, conflict of interest, or manifest
error.

(c) _Additional Escrow Deposit; Payment Procedures_. When any Earnout Payment
becomes due and payable, Parent shall pay, or cause the Surviving Corporation
to pay, 8% of the amount of such Earnout Payment, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to the Escrow Agent for deposit into the
Indemnity Escrow and pay the balance of such Earnout Payment to the Paying
Agent for distribution to the Effective Time Holders in accordance with
_Sections 1.5_ , _1.6_ and _1.7_ ; _provided, however_ , that no such deposit
into the Indemnity Escrow shall be required if an Earnout Payment is made
more than eighteen (18) months following the Effective Time unless the amounts
subject to Continuing Claims exceed the amount then held in the Indemnity
Escrow, in which case Parent shall deposit into the Indemnity Escrow the
lesser of (x) 8% of such Earnout Payment and (y) the amount by which the
amounts subject to Continuing Claims exceed the amount then held in the
Indemnity Escrow.

 

(d) _Acceleration Events_.

 

(i) The Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment will become immediately due and
payable (with the Company Net Revenue Earnout Payment amount being set at the
$85,000,000 maximum payment) upon the occurrence of the following on or prior
to December 31, 2017: the sale or other disposition of all or substantially
all of the Surviving Corporations business or assets by way of stock sale,
merger, asset sale or otherwise, or the sale, transfer, exclusive license or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company Intellectual
Property.

 

(ii) The Milestone Earnout Payment will become immediately due and payable
upon the occurrence of the following on or prior to completion of the
prospective clinical utility trial: the sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the Surviving Corporations business or assets by way of

license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company
Intellectual Property.

(e) _Setoff_. The obligation of Parent to pay, or cause to be paid, any
Earnout Payment pursuant to this _Section 1.11_ is subject to the right of
Parent or its applicable designee to reduce the amount of any such Earnout
Payment that becomes due and payable by the amount of any Damages incurred or
suffered by a Parent Indemnitee in accordance with the terms of  _Section
10.3(e)_.

(f) _Miscellaneous_. The parties hereto understand and agree that (i) the
contingent rights to receive the Earnout Payments do not constitute equity or
ownership interests in Parent or the Surviving Corporation and are not
transferable, except: (w) to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of
an Effective Time Holder or the immediate family of an Effective Time Holder
(for purposes of this paragraph, "immediate family" shall mean any
relationship by blood, marriage or adoption, not more remote than first
cousin), (x) by operation of law, including pursuant to a distribution or a
domestic relations order, in connection with a divorce settlement or with
respect to community property, (y) by will or other testamentary document or
intestate succession upon the death of an Effective Time Holder and (z) to
any Affiliate, stockholder, member or limited partner of an Effective Time
Holder that is an Entity, provided that such Effective Time Holder who so
transfers its interests is responsible to notify Parent of any such
transfer and provide any necessary information related to the transferee;
(ii) no Effective Time Holder shall have any rights as a securityholder of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation as a result of such Effective Time
Holders contingent right to receive Earnout Payments hereunder; and (iii) no
amount of interest is payable with respect to any Earnout Payment. Under
applicable Tax Law, a portion of each Earnout Payment may be treated and
reported as interest, including on any relevant Tax Return.

2\. Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as set forth in the
Disclosure Schedules prepared by the Company and delivered to Parent prior to
the execution of this Agreement setting forth exceptions to the Companys
representations and warranties set forth in this _Section 2_ in accordance
with _Section 11.19_, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and

duly organized, and is validly existing and in good standing (or its

conditioned or delayed) to the taking of such action by the Acquired Company;
or (B) such action is required to be taken by this Agreement; or (ii)
_Schedule 4.2_.

4.3 Notification. Each of the parties hereto shall refrain from taking any

to a possible Acquisition Transaction. The Company shall promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours of receipt thereof) notify Parent orally and in writing
of any inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer or request for non-
public information relating to a possible Acquisition Transaction that is
received by any Acquired Company during the Pre-Closing Period, which notice

inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer or request, and the terms and
conditions thereof; and (ii) an accurate and complete copy of all written

proposal, offer or request).

4.5 Termination of 401(k) Plan. The Company shall take (or cause to be taken)
all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the AssureRx Health Retirement
Plan (the " _401(k) Plan_ ") unless Parent, in its sole and absolute
discretion, agrees to sponsor and maintain the 401(k) Plan by providing the
Company with written notice of such election (an " _Election Notice_ ") at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Unless Parent
provides an Election Notice to the Company, the Company shall deliver to
Parent, prior to the Closing Date, evidence that the Companys board of
directors has validly adopted resolutions to terminate the 401(k) Plan (the
form and substance of which resolutions shall be reasonably satisfactory to

Date. In connection with the termination of the 401(k) Plan, Parent shall
permit each Acquired Company employee to make rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code, including all participant loans) in an amount equal to the eligible
rollover distribution portion of the account balance distributed to each such
Acquired Company employee from the 401(k) Plan to an "eligible retirement
plan" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of Parent or any
of its Affiliates (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "). In the event that the
distributions of assets from the trust of a 401(k) Plan which is terminated is
reasonably anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges, or
other fees to be imposed upon the account of any participant or beneficiary
of such terminated plan or upon any Company or plan sponsor, then the Company
shall take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of
such charges or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent prior to
the Effective Time.

4.6 Tail Insurance. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, at its
own expense, purchase through its insurance brokerage (the " _Incumbent
Brokerage_ ") an extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage (the " _D andO
Tail Policy_") for the Acquired Companies directors and officers, which shall
provide such directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years following
the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have
other terms not materially less favorable to, the insured persons than the
directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by
the Company. Parent shall cause the DandO Tail Policy to be maintained in full
force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to
be honored by the Surviving Corporation. Following the Effective Time, Parent
shall not take any steps, including the appointment of a different
broker, that would prevent the Incumbent Brokerage from representing the
Companys existing directors and officers for the purposes of the DandO Tail
Policy and any claims related thereto throughout the term of the DandO Tail
Policy. 

4.7 Director and Officer Liability. Parent and Merger Sub agree that all
rights to exculpation, expense advancement and indemnification for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time existing as of the date of
this Agreement in favor of the individuals who on or prior to the Effective
Time were the current and former directors and officers of any Acquired
Company or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their predecessors in
all of their capacities (including as a stockholder, controlling or otherwise)
or who were serving at the request of any Acquired Company as an officer
or director of any other corporation, partnership or joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise, including, in each case, the heirs,
executors, trustees, fiduciaries and administrators of any

such officer or director (each, an " _Indemnified D andO_"), as provided in any
Acquired Companys Charter Documents or in any agreement made available to
Parent, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms. In addition, for a period of six (6) years
following the Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries not to, amend, repeal or otherwise modified
in any manner that is less favorable to any Indemnified DandO in any material
respect the Charter Documents of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries in effect immediately following the Effective Time.

and (ii) (A) through December 31, 2016, welfare benefits that are no less
favorable than the compensation and benefits provided to the Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Closing, and (B) after December 31, 2016,
welfare benefits that are substantially comparable to the other compensation
and benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Affiliates (excluding the Continuing Employees), but excluding equity
compensation. This _Section 5.4_ shall not limit the obligation of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to maintain any
compensation arrangement or benefit plan that, pursuant to an existing
contract or applicable law, must be maintained for a period longer than one
year. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of
continued employment of any Continuing Employee and this Agreement shall not
be construed so as to prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from having
the right to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee, provided
that any such termination is effected in accordance with applicable law.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Parent shall give each Continuing Employee
full credit for all purposes (including for purposes of eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, early retirement eligibility and early
retirement subsidies, vesting and benefit accrual) under any employee benefit
plans, arrangements, collective agreements and employment-related
entitlements (including under any applicable pension, 401(k), savings,
medical, dental, life insurance, vacation, long-service leave or other leave
entitlements, post-retirement health and life insurance, termination
indemnity, severance or separation pay plans) provided, sponsored, maintained
or contributed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for such Continuing
Employees service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and with any
predecessor employer, to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing, except to the extent
such credit would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of
service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted
under applicable law, Parent shall not be required to provide credit for such
service for benefit accrual purposes under any employee benefit plan of Parent
that is a defined benefit pension plan.

 

(c) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive for each
Continuing Employee and his or her dependents, any waiting period provision,
payment requirement to avoid a waiting period, pre-existing condition
limitation, actively-at-work requirement and any other restriction that would
prevent immediate or full participation under the welfare plans of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries applicable to such Continuing Employee to the extent
such waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively-at-work
requirement or other restriction would not have been applicable to

such Continuing Employee under the terms of the welfare plans of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) give full credit under the welfare plans
of Parent and its Subsidiaries applicable to each Continuing Employee and his
or her dependents for all co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the
Closing in the same plan year as the Closing, and for any lifetime maximums,
as if there had been a single continuous employer.

(d) Nothing in this _Section 5.4_ shall (i) be construed as an amendment or
other modification of any Acquired Company Employee Plan, (ii) give any third
party any right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or (iii) limit the
right of Parent, the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Acquired Company
Employee Plan.

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Closing Date
Transaction Bonuses and Post-Closing Date Transaction Bonuses in accordance
with the terms of the Equity Transition Plan.

 

5.5 Provision Respecting Legal Representation; Attorney-Client Privilege.

 

(a) Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its directors, members, partners, officers, employees and
Affiliates, that Latham and Watkins LLP and Thompson Hine LLP may serve as
counsel to each and any Effective Time Holder and such Effective Time Holders
respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the " _Holder Group_
"), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Existing
Representation_ "), and that, following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, Latham and Watkins LLP (or any successor) and/or Thompson
Hine LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to the Holder Group or any
director, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the Holder Group,
in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(any such representation, a " _Post-Closing Representation_ ")
notwithstanding the Existing Representation, and each of the parties hereto
hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom,
and each of such parties shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to
waive any conflict of interest arising from the Existing Representation.

(b) From and after the Closing, Parent waives and hereby agrees not to
control or assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) to waive and to not control or assert, any attorney-client
privilege, attorney work-product protection or other similar privilege or
protection applicable to, or any expectation of client confidence with respect
to, (i) any communication between any legal counsel (including Latham and
Watkins LLP and/or Thompson Hine LLP), on the one hand, and the Holder Group,
on the other hand, regarding the negotiation, execution, and delivery of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any Post-Closing
Representation (other than any Third-Party Claim), or (ii) any other advice
given to the Holder Group by Latham and Watkins LLP and/or Thompson Hine LLP,
occurring during the Existing Representation in connection with any Post-
Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute between the
Holder Group and one or more of Parent and its Affiliates (the items listed in
clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the " _Specified Privileges_ "), it being
the intention of the parties hereto that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in _Section 1.1_ or _Section 1.2_ hereof or Section 259 of the
DGCL, the right to waive, assert and otherwise control such Specified
Privileges in any Post-Closing Representation (other than any Third Party
Claim) shall be (and are hereby) transferred to or retained by (as
applicable), and vested solely in, the Holder Group, and shall not pass to or
be claimed or used by Parent, except as provided in the last sentence of this
_Section 5.5(b)_. Furthermore, Parent (on behalf of itself and its

Affiliates) acknowledges and agrees that any advice given to or communication
with the Holder Group shall not be subject to any joint privilege (whether or
not the Company also received such advice or communication) and shall be
owned solely by the Holder Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that a dispute arises between Parent or the Company, on the one hand, and a
third party other than the Holder Group, on the other hand, the Company shall
(and shall cause its Affiliates to) assert the Specified Privileges on behalf
of the Holder Group to prevent disclosure of Privileged Materials to such
third party; provided, however, that such privilege may be waived only with
the prior written consent of the Securityholders Agent.

(c) All such Specified Privileges, and all books and records and other
documents of the Company containing any advice or communication that is
subject to any Specified Privileges (" _Privileged Materials_ "), shall be
excluded from the Merger, and shall be distributed to the Securityholders
Agent (on behalf of the Holder Group) immediately prior to the Closing with
(in the case of such books and records) no copies retained by the Company.
Absent the prior written consent of the Securityholders Agent, neither
Parent nor (following the Closing) the Company shall have a right of access to
Privileged Materials.

 

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that it has had the opportunity (including on
behalf of its Affiliates) to discuss and obtain adequate information
concerning the significance and material risks of, and reasonable available
alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other provisions of this
_Section 5.5_, including the opportunity to consult with counsel other
than Latham and Watkins LLP and Thompson Hine LLP. This _Section 5.5_ shall be
irrevocable, and no term of this _Section 5.5_ may be amended, waived or
modified, without the prior written consent of the Securityholders Agent and
each of Latham and Watkins LLP and Thompson Hine LLP.

6\. Tax Matters.

 

6.1 Liability for Taxes.

 

(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time, each Effective Time
Holder shall, severally and not jointly, hold harmless and indemnify each of
the Parent Indemnitees from and against such Effective Time Holders Pro Rata
Share of any Damages that are directly or indirectly suffered or incurred at
any time by any of the Parent Indemnitees or to which any of the Parent
Indemnitees may otherwise directly or indirectly become subject at any time
(regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any Third Party Claim)
and that arise directly or indirectly from or as a result of, or are directly
or indirectly connected with, without duplication, (1) any breach of, or
inaccuracy in, any of the representations or warranties of the Company in
_Section 2.20_, (2) Taxes imposed on any Acquired Company, or for which any
Acquired Company may otherwise be liable (including as a transferee or
successor, by contract, agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, but
excluding Contracts not primarily related to Taxes entered into in the
ordinary course of business), for any taxable year or period that ends on or
before the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion
of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date, (3) any
Transfer Taxes for which the Effective Time Holders are liable pursuant to
_Section 6.7_, and (4) any withholding Tax imposed in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any payment thereof,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, the employer portion of any payroll
and employee withholding Taxes, employment, unemployment insurance, social
security, workers compensation, and other obligations of a similar nature,
imposed in connection with any payment made pursuant to this Agreement;
_provided, however_ , in each case, that no Effective Time Holder shall be
liable for any Tax Liability to the extent such Tax Liability is taken into
account in computing Closing Net Indebtedness Amount or the Net Working
Capital Amount.

Portions of this Exhibit, indicated by the mark "[***]," were omitted and have
been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to
the Registrants application requesting confidential treatment pursuant to
Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. CONFIDENTIAL



 

(b) _Straddle Period_. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever it is
necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of any Acquired Company for a
Straddle Period, (1) the amount of any Taxes imposed on or calculated by
reference to income, gain, receipts, capital, sales, use or payment of wages
of an Acquired Company for the period ending on the Closing Date shall be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the Taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Acquired Company holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time); _provided,
however_ , that exemptions, allowances, and deductions calculated on an annual
basis, such as depreciation deductions, shall be apportioned between the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of
the Straddle period commencing after the Closing Date as described immediately
hereafter in clause (2), and (2) the amount of all other Taxes of the Acquired
Company for the portion of any Straddle Period through the and including the
Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

(c) _Controlled Foreign Corporation_. For purposes of _Section 6.1(a)_,
whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Company
under Section 951 of the Code with respect to any Subsidiary that is of a
controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of Section 957 of the Code
(a " _CFC_ ") attributable to the taxable year or period of such CFC that
begins on or before and ends after the Closing Date, the determination of
liability for any such Taxes shall be made by assuming that the taxable year
or period of the CFC consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which
ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other of which began at the
beginning of the day following the Closing Date and relevant items of income,
gain, deduction, loss or credit of the controlled foreign corporation shall
be allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the
books basis" by assuming that the books of the controlled foreign corporation
were closed at the close of the Closing Date.

6.2 Tax Returns.

 

(a) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns for any Acquired Company that relate to any Tax period ending
on or before the Closing Date which are due after the Closing Date (a " _Pre-
Closing Tax Return_ ") or Straddle Period. All such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice of the applicable Acquired
Company, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements. At least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including any extensions) of any such
Pre-Closing Tax Return or Straddle Period Tax Return, Parent shall cause a
draft copy of such Tax Return to be delivered to the Securityholders Agent
for the Securityholders Agents review and comment. Parent shall consider in
good faith any and all reasonable comments provided by the Securityholders
Agent with respect to any such Tax Returns to the extent such comments are
consistent with past practices of the applicable Acquired Company; _provided_
that such reasonable comments are delivered in writing by
the Securityholders Agent to Parent within fifteen (15) days of delivery of
the draft Tax Returns by Parent to Securityholders Agent (the " _Tax
Comments_ "). If the Securityholders Agent does not provide Tax
Comments within such period, the amount of Taxes shown to be due and payable
on such Tax Return shall be deemed to be accepted and agreed upon, and final
and conclusive, for purposes of this _Section 6.2(a)_. If Tax Comments are
timely provided by the Securityholders Agent in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, then Parent shall consider in good faith such Tax
Comments and the parties shall act in good faith to resolve any dispute prior
to the due date of any such Pre-Closing Tax Return or Straddle Period Tax
Return. If Parent and the Securityholders Agent cannot resolve any such
disputed Tax Comment, the disputed items shall be referred to a senior Tax
partner at the Accounting Firm (the " _Tax Arbitrator_ ") for prompt
resolution (in

Portions of this Exhibit, indicated by the mark "[***]," were omitted and have
been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to
the Registrants application requesting confidential treatment pursuant to
Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. CONFIDENTIAL



 

accordance with the provisions of this _Section 6.2(a)_), whose determination
shall be final and conclusive for purposes of this  _Section 6.2(a)_. The
Tax Arbitrator shall be instructed to use every reasonable effort to complete
its services as soon as practicable after such submission. If the Tax
Arbitrator is unable to resolve the dispute prior to the due date (including
any extensions) of such Tax Returns, Parent shall cause the Tax Comments with
respect to which there is no dispute among the parties to be reflected on such
Tax Returns, and the parties agree to amend any such Tax Returns to the
extent necessary based on the final determination of the Tax Arbitrator with
respect to the disputed items. The fees and expenses of the Tax Arbitrator in
connection with its work pursuant to this _Section 6.2(a)_ shall be
apportioned between the Parent and the Securityholders Agent (on behalf of
the Effective Time Holders) based upon the relative success of each such
partys claims as reflected in the determinations made by the Tax Arbitrator.
Any and all third-party costs, fees or expenses incurred by Parent, its
Affiliates or any Acquired Company in connection with any Pre-Closing Tax
Return and fifty percent (50%) of any such fees and expenses in current in
connection with any Straddle Period Tax Return, in each case prepared or
filed in connection with this _Section 6.2(a)_, shall be considered Damages
for which the Parent Indemnitees shall be indemnified and held harmless.

 

6.3 Tax Proceedings.

 

(a) Parent shall notify Securityholders Agent in writing upon receipt by
Parent, any of its Affiliates or, after the Closing Date, the Acquired
Companies of notice of any pending federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits
or assessments relating to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date or to any Straddle Period (the " _Tax Proceeding Notice_ "). The failure
to promptly give such Tax Proceeding Notice shall not, however, relieve any
Effective Time Holder of its indemnification obligations, except and only to
the extent that such Effective Time Holder is actually prejudiced thereby.

(b) The Securityholders Agent shall have the right to participate in or, upon
providing written notice to the Parent within fifteen (15) days of receipt of
such Tax Proceeding Notice, to assume the defense of any audit, investigation
or similar proceeding or claim (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") relating solely to
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date at the Securityholders
Agents expense (on behalf of the Effective Time Holders) and by the
Securityholders Agents own counsel; _provided_ that (i) Securityholders
Agent shall be obligated to keep Parent reasonably informed of all material
developments and events relating to such Tax Proceeding (including promptly
forwarding copies to the Parent of any related correspondence, and providing
the Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on any material
correspondence before the Securityholders Agents sends such correspondence
to any Tax Authority), (ii) Parent shall have the right, at Parents expense,
to participate in any Tax Proceedings with counsel selected by it, and (iii)
Securityholders Agents shall not settle, resolve, or abandon such Tax
Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) If the Securityholders Agent is not entitled to control a Tax Proceeding
under _Section 6.3(b)_, fails to give timely and duly written notification
to the Parent of its election to defend such Tax Proceeding as provided in
this Agreement, fails to diligently defend such Tax Proceeding, or otherwise
comply with its obligations in controlling such Tax Proceeding pursuant this
_Section 6.3_, Parent may, without prejudice to its right to indemnification
hereunder, assume control of such Tax Proceedings and seek indemnification for
any and all Damages based upon, arising from or relating to such Tax
Proceedings; _provided_ that (i) Parent shall be obligated to keep
Securityholders Agent reasonably informed of all material developments and
events relating to such Tax Proceeding (including promptly forwarding copies
to the Securityholders Agent of any related correspondence), (ii)
Securityholders Agent (on behalf of the Effective Time Holders) shall have
the right to participate, at its sole expense, in any Tax Proceedings with
counsel selected by it, and (iii) Parent shall not and shall not allow any
Affiliate thereof to settle, resolve, or abandon such Tax Proceeding without
the prior written consent of the Securityholders Agent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d) Parent shall have the sole right to represent each Acquired Companys
interests in any Tax Proceedings with respect to any Straddle Period,
_provided_ that (i) Parent shall be obligated to keep Securityholders Agent
reasonably informed of all material developments and events relating to such
Tax Proceeding (including promptly forwarding copies to the Securityholders
Agent of any related correspondence), and (ii) Parent shall not and shall not
allow any Affiliate thereof to settle, resolve, or abandon such Tax Proceeding
without the prior written consent of the Securityholders Agents (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

6.4 Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing Date, each of
Securityholders Agent and Parent shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to):

(a) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax
Returns or other reports with respect to sales, transfer and similar Taxes;

 

(b) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party
is responsible for preparing and filing;

 

(c) cooperate fully in preparing for and defending any audits of, or disputes
with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of any Acquired Company;

(d) make available to the other and to any taxing authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the
Acquired Companies, including any ownership information necessary to determine
the presence or absence of an "ownership change" within the meaning of Section
382 of the Code;

 

(e) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any
taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with
respect to any such taxable period; _provided_ , that Parent shall only be
obligated to furnish copies of such correspondence to Securityholders Agent
to the extent such audit or information request relates to Taxes for which
the Effective Time Holders may be liable under the terms of this Agreement;
and

(f) furnish all books and records with respect to Taxes for a period of at
least seven (7) years following the Closing Date.

6.5 Termination of Tax Sharing Arrangements. Any Tax Sharing Arrangement
entered into by any Acquired Company, other than this Agreement, shall be
terminated as to each Acquired Company on or prior to the Closing, and after
the Closing no Acquired Company shall have any Liability thereunder.

6.6 Survival, Etc.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including _Section
10_), the obligations of the parties set forth in this  _Section 6_ shall
survive the Effective Time until the date that is sixty (60) days after the
expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations (including any extensions
thereof); _provided, however_ , that if, at any time on or prior to the
expiration date referred to in this sentence, any Parent Indemnitee delivers
to the Securityholders Agent a written notice asserting a claim for recovery
under

this _Section 6_ based on such alleged breach, then the claim asserted in
such notice shall survive until such time as such claim is fully and finally
resolved. No claim made pursuant to this _Section 6_ shall be subject to the
limitations in _Section 10.3_ (except for _Sections 10.3(f)_ and _10.3(g)_ ).
The obligations of the parties set forth in this  _Section 6_ shall not be
subject to any limitation under _Section 10.3_ (except for _Sections 10.3(f)_
and _10.3(g)_ ).

 

6.7 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use,
registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable
real estate transfer Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") will be borne by 50%
by Parent and 50% by the Securityholders. Parent and the Securityholders
Agent further agree, upon request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or
any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.8 Tax Refunds. The Effective Time Holders shall be entitled to the amount
of any refund (or credit of Taxes claimed in lieu of any refund at the
election of Parent or any affiliate thereof after the Closing Date) of any
Acquired Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (to the extent
such Taxes were paid by any Acquired Company prior to the Closing or by the
Effective Time Holders pursuant to a claim for indemnification after the
Closing) which refund is actually received (or credit is actually recognized)
by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including any Acquired Company) after the
Closing, net of any cost to Parent and its Affiliates attributable to the
obtaining and receipt of such refund or credit, except to the extent such
refund or credit arises as the result of a carryback of a loss or other tax
benefit from a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date. Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Paying Agent for
distribution to the Effective Time Holders any amount to which the Effective
Time Holders are entitled pursuant to the prior sentence within five (5)
Business Days of the receipt of the applicable refund or claim of such credit
by Parent or its Subsidiaries. To the extent requested by the
Securityholders Agent, Parent will reasonably cooperate, at the expense of
the Effective Time Holders, with reasonable written requests by the
Securityholders Agent in obtaining such refund or credit, including through
the filing of amended Tax Returns for periods ending before or on the Closing
Date or refund claims. To the extent such refund or credit is subsequently
disallowed or required to be returned to the applicable Tax Authority, the
Effective Time Holders agree promptly to repay the amount of such refund or
credit, together with any interest, penalties or other additional amounts
imposed by such Tax Authority, to Parent.

6.9 Certain Actions. Except with the express written consent of the
Securityholders Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed,
conditioned or withheld, Parent shall not (i) make any election for any
Subsidiary of the Company under Section 338(g) of the Code or (ii) except in
connection with any Tax Proceeding or as otherwise governed by the procedures
governing filings of Tax Returns pursuant to _Section 6.2_, (a) amend any Tax
Return of any Acquired Company for any period ending on or before the Closing
Date, (b) change any annual Tax accounting period or any period ending on or
before the Closing Date, (c) surrender any right to claim a Tax refund for any
period ending on or before the Closing Date, or (d) consent to any extension
or waiver of the statute of limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or
assessment (other than in connection with ordinary course extenuations for
filing Tax Returns), in each case to the extent such action could reasonably
be expected to result in any increased Tax liability for which the
Securityholders would be required to provide indemnification pursuant to
_Section 6.6_ or _Section 10_ hereof. 

6.10 Coordination. If there shall be any conflicts between the provisions of
this _Section 6_ and  _Section 10_, the provisions of this _Section 6_
shall control with respect to Taxes.

Requirements.

 

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any payments made to any

Tax Returns to the greatest extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, subject to the provisions of _Section 6.11(c)_.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to sustain the tax treatment described in this _Section 6.11_ in any

of such representations and warranties, all materiality, Material Adverse
Effect and similar qualifications limiting the scope of such representations

other Damages arising from any other inaccuracies or breaches of any
representations or warranties) that have been directly or indirectly suffered
or incurred by any one or more of such Parent Indemnitees or Holder
Indemnitees, as applicable, exceeds $1,250,000 in the aggregate (the "
_Deductible Amount_ "). If the total amount of such Damages pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 10.2(a)(xi)_, on the one hand, or _Section

amounts as are deposited into the Indemnity Escrow pursuant to _Section
1.11(c)_.

 

(e) _Set Off_. Subject to the limitations and procedures set forth in this

Effective Time Holders pursuant to this Agreement against any Earnout Payments
that Parent may be obliged to make (or procure to be made) to the Effective
Time Holders pursuant to this Agreement; _provided further_ that the Parent
Indemnitees shall first seek recovery from the Indemnity Escrow or the
Accelerable Escrow (in the case of Effective Time Holders who have not
delivered a Joinder Agreement, Warrant Surrender Agreement or Option
Termination Agreement, as the case may be, prior to Parents becoming
obligated to make the payment subject to such set off, deduction or retention)
(but for such recovery from the Accelerable Escrow, the maximum amount of
recovery shall be equal to the lesser of (X) the amount of money then
remaining in the Accelerable Escrow and (Y) (i) the amount subject to such set
off _multiplied by_ (ii) a fraction, of which (A) the numerator is the amount
of money in the Accelerable Escrow Account due to those Effective Time Holders

off, reduction or retention is sought by Parent; and (B) the denominator is
the Purchase Price).

Specified Representations; or (C) to any of the matters to which _Section 6_
applies. Each Effective Time Holder shall, severally and not jointly (based on
such Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share), indemnify and hold harmless
each Parent Indemnitee from and against any Damages arising directly or
indirectly from, resulting from, or directly or indirectly

of any deductible or co-payment and all out of pocket costs related to such
recovery and net of any insurance premium increases attributable to such
insurance recovery). If any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments,
contribution payments, reimbursements or other recoveries are subsequently
recovered by an Indemnitee (or any of its Affiliates) after payment has been
made by Parent or the Effective Time Holders, as applicable, in accordance
with this _Section 10_ with respect to the Damages to which such
insurance recoveries relate, then the Indemnitee shall remit or cause to be
remitted to Parent or the Effective Time Holders, as applicable, such
insurance recoveries (net of any deductible or co-payment and all out of
pocket costs related to such recovery); provided that in no event shall any
Indemnitee have any obligation hereunder to remit any portion of such
insurance recoveries in excess of the indemnification payment or payments
actually received by such Indemnitee with respect to such Damages. 

(ii) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
_Section 10_, for purposes of computing the amount of any Damages incurred
by any Indemnitee under this _Section 10_ or _Section 6.1_, there shall be
deducted an amount equal to the net amount of any Tax benefit actually
realized in connection with such Damages on or before the year following the
year when such Damages were incurred, calculated on a with and without basis.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Parent Indemnitee
shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 10_ or
_Section 6 _for any Damages resulting from, or relating or attributable to,
any Tax attribute of any Acquired Company, including but not limited to any
net operating loss, any net operating loss carryover, any Tax credit, any Tax
credit carryover or any other Tax attribute of any Acquired Company which may
be affected in any way by the acquisition of control under the applicable
Legal Requirements, or the determination that any such Tax attribute is
subject to any limitation on its use under the applicable Legal Requirements.

agrees that such Effective Time Holder shall not have and shall not exercise
or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right
of indemnity or advancement of expenses or other right or remedy against the
Surviving Corporation or any Acquired Company in connection with
any indemnification obligation or any other Liability to which such Effective
Time Holder may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement or
any other agreement, document or instrument delivered to Parent in connection
with this Agreement. Effective as of the Closing, the Securityholders Agent,
on behalf of itself and each Effective Time Holder, and each Effective Time
Holder expressly waives and releases any and all rights of subrogation,
contribution, advancement, indemnification or other claim against Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Acquired Company.

10.5 Claim Procedures. Any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 10
_(and, at the option of any Indemnitee, any claim based upon fraud) shall be
brought and resolved exclusively as follows:

 

(a) If any Indemnitee has or claims in good faith to have incurred or
suffered, or believes in good faith that it may incur or suffer, Damages for
which it is or may be entitled to indemnification under _Section 6_ or this
_Section 10_ or for which it is or may otherwise be entitled to a monetary
remedy relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, such Indemnitee may deliver a claim notice (a
" _Claim Notice_ ") to the Securityholders Agent or Parent as applicable.
Each Claim Notice shall: (i) contain a brief description of the facts and
circumstances supporting the Indemnitees claim; and (ii) if practicable,
contain a non-binding, preliminary, good faith estimate of the amount to which
the Indemnitee might be entitled.

 

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnitee shall be entitled under  _Section 6_
or this _Section 10_ shall be determined (i) by the written agreement between
the Indemnitee and the Securityholders Agent or Parent, as applicable, (ii)
by a final judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction or (iii)
by any other means to which the Indemnitee and the Securityholders Agent or
Parent, as applicable, shall agree. The judgment or decree of a court shall be
deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no
appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally
determined.

(c) In the event that any Parent Indemnitee is determined pursuant to this
_Section 10.5_ to be entitled to indemnification, such Parent Indemnitee
shall be entitled to a distribution from the Indemnity Escrow in an amount
equal to the Damages incurred or suffered in connection therewith.

Business Days following the Indemnity Escrow Release Date, Parent and

Indemnity Escrow an amount in the aggregate equal to (A) the Indemnity Escrow
Amount _minus_ (B) any amounts released to the Parent Indemnitees from the

properly completed Letter of Transmittal and surrendered such Effective Time
Holders Company Stock Certificate in accordance with _Section 1.9(b)_
(collectively, the " _Payment Conditions_ ") prior to the date of any
scheduled release from the Indemnity Escrow, then any amount that would
otherwise be released to such Effective Time Holder shall be held by the
Paying Agent, without interest, until such holder satisfies all of such
Effective Time Holders applicable Payment Conditions; (ii) amounts to be
released from the Indemnity Escrow to be distributed to each such Effective
Time Holder shall be deemed to be the product of (A) the aggregate amount to
be released from the Indemnity Escrow to such Effective Time Holder;
_multiplied by_ (B) such Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share (excluding
all shares of Company Preferred Stock that are designated as "Series D
Preferred Stock" and shares of Series D Preferred Stock subject to Company

the date that is five (5) years following the Closing Date (the "

Accelerable Escrow Deposit, it being acknowledged and agreed that such amount

10.7 Defense of Third Party Claims. The party making a claim for
indemnification under this Section 10.7 is referred to as the " _Indemnified
Party_ ," and the party against whom such claim for indemnification is
asserted under this _Section 10.7_ is referred to as the " _Indemnifying
Party_."

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against
the Company, Parent or any other Person) made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of any of the foregoing (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against
such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice
thereof. The failure to promptly give such written notice shall not, however,
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and
only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced
thereby. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party
Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Damages that have been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate
in or, upon providing written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) days of receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim in which the
Indemnifying Party acknowledges without qualification its indemnification
obligation hereunder (subject only to the applicable limitations set forth in
this _Section 10.7_), to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Partys expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel,
which counsel must be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party
Claim, subject to _Section 10.7(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
reasonably in the defense thereof. The Indemnified Party shall have the right
to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected
by it, subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the defense
thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of
the Indemnified Party, _provided_ , that if in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the Indemnified Party, there are legal defenses available to an
Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party, such fees and disbursements shall be at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or
defend such Third Party Claim, fails to give timely and sufficient
notification to the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as
provided in this Agreement, or fails to diligently defend such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, subject to _Section 10.7(b)_, without
prejudice to its right to indemnification hereunder, defend such Third Party
Claim and may seek indemnification for any and all Damages based upon,
arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim in accordance with this
Section 10\. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 10.7_, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume
control of a Third Party Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall control such
Third Party Claim, if (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, investigation or
allegation, (ii) the Third Party Claim seeks injunctive or other equitable
relief or relief other than for monetary Damages against the Indemnified Party
(except, in each

case, where such injunctive or other equitable relief is merely incidental to
a primary claim or claims for monetary Damages), (iii) an actual or
readily apparent conflict of interest (in the opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Party) exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party with respect to the Third Party Claim that precludes effective joint
representation or (iv) a claim is made by a Parent Indemnitee and the amounts
reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with such Third Party Claim,
together with all other outstanding claims on the Indemnity Escrow, exceed the
amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow. If, pursuant to this _Section
10.7(a)_, the Indemnified Party so contests, defends, litigates or settles a
Third Party Claim for which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder, the
Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party for the
reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses of defending the Third Party
Claim which are incurred from time to time, promptly following the
presentation to the Indemnifying Party of itemized bills for such attorneys
fees and other expenses, subject, however, to any applicable limitations set
forth in this _Section 10.7_. Subject to any applicable limitations set forth
in this _Section 10.7_, all expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by
the Indemnifying Party in connection with the foregoing shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party.

 

(b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed so long as: (i) a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim
that (A) does not impose injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates (including any equitable remedies
or other obligations or restrictions upon the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates), (B) would not lead to any liability or the creation of a
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates, (C) provides, in customary form, for the full,
unconditional written release of each Indemnified Party and its Affiliates
from all Liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party
Claim, and (D) does not adversely affect the conduct of the business of the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party
provides written notice to the Indemnified Party that it desires to accept and
agree to such offer and the terms thereof. If the Indemnified Party has
assumed the defense pursuant to  _Section 10.7(a)_, it shall not agree to
any settlement without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(c) _Cooperation_. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate in good faith with each other in all reasonable respects in
connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including, upon the
reasonable request of the defending party, providing copies of records within
the non-defending partys possession or control relating to such Third Party
Claim and making available, without expense (other than reimbursement of
actual out-of-pocket expenses), Representatives of the non-defending party as
may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third
Party Claim.

10.8 Exclusive Remedy. Except (a) in the event of fraud and (b) for equitable
remedies, from and after the Effective Time, the rights to indemnification,
compensation and reimbursement set forth in this _Section 10_ shall be the
sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the Parent Indemnitees with respect to
any breach of this Agreement.

 

10.9 Order of Recovery. In the event any Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled
to any indemnification payment pursuant to this  _Section 10_, such amount
shall be paid first from the Indemnity Escrow and, to the extent there are
insufficient funds in the Indemnity Escrow, then the remainder from pursuant
to _Section 10.3(e)_ before recovery can be made against any Effective Time
Holder; provided that in the case of Effective Time Holders who have not
delivered a Joinder Agreement, Warrant Surrender Agreement or Option
Termination Agreement, as the case may be, prior to Parents
becoming entitled to such indemnification payment, amounts shall be paid
first from the Accelerable Escrow prior to set off, deduction or retention
pursuant to _Section 10.3(e)_.

11\. Miscellaneous Provisions.

 

11.1 Securityholders Agent.

 

(a) _Appointment_. By virtue of the adoption and approval of this Agreement,
the Joinder Agreements, the Warrant Surrender Agreements and the Option
Termination Agreements and without any further action by any of the Effective
Time Holders or the Company, the Effective Time Holders irrevocably nominate,
constitute and appoint Fortis Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, as the exclusive agent and true and lawful attorney in fact of the
Effective Time Holders (the " _Securityholders  Agent_"), with full power of
substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of the Effective Time
Holders for purposes of executing any documents and taking or refraining from
any actions that the Securityholders Agent may, in the Securityholders
Agents sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or
appropriate in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the
Paying Agent Agreement, the Securityholders Agent engagement agreement, and
any other agreement, document or instrument referred to in or contemplated by
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement, and any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or any such other agreement,
document or instrument, including with respect to, any claim for
indemnification under _Sections 6_ and _10_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Securityholders Agent shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the
Effective Time Holders, except as expressly provided herein and in the Escrow
Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement, the Securityholders Agent engagement
agreement. The Securityholders Agent hereby accepts its appointment as
Securityholders Agent.

 

(b) _Authority_. The Effective Time Holders grant to the Securityholders
Agent full authority to execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file on
behalf of such Effective Time Holders (in the name of any or all of the
Effective Time Holders or otherwise) any and all documents that the
Securityholders Agent may, in its sole discretion, determine to
be necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such forms and containing such
provisions as the Securityholders Agent may, in its sole discretion,
determine to be appropriate, in performing its duties as contemplated by
_Section 11.1(a)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement or in any other agreement executed in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby: (i) each Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled
to deal exclusively with the Securityholders Agent on all matters relating
to any claim for indemnification under _Section 10_; and (ii) each Parent
Indemnitee shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of
any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on
behalf of any Effective Time Holder by the Securityholders Agent, and on any
other action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any Effective Time
Holder by the Securityholders Agent, as fully binding upon such Effective
Time Holder and such Effective Time Holders successors as if expressly
confirmed and ratified in writing by such Effective Time Holder. All actions,
decisions and instructions of the Securityholders Agent taken, made or given
pursuant to the authority granted to the Securityholders Agent pursuant to
this _Section 11.1_ shall be conclusive and binding upon each Effective Time
Holder, and no such holder shall have the right to object to, dissent from,
protest or otherwise contest the same. The terms and conditions of this
Agreement are hereby made, and are hereby acknowledged to be, dependent upon
the determinations and actions that are contemplated or permitted to be made
by the Securityholders Agent pursuant to this _Section 11.1_, and the rights
of all Effective Time Holders shall be qualified by and dependent upon such
determinations and actions, irrespective of whether the Securityholders
Agent is acting as an agent or power of attorney of such Effective Time
Holder.

been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to
the Registrants application requesting confidential treatment pursuant to
Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. CONFIDENTIAL



 

(c) _Power of Attorney_. The Effective Time Holders recognize and intend that
the power of attorney granted in  _Section 11.1(a)_, immunity and indemnity
granted to the Securityholders Agent Group: (i) is coupled with an interest
and is irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the Securityholders Agent; (iii)
shall survive the death, incapacity, dissolution, liquidation or winding up
of each of the Effective Time Holders and shall be binding on any successor
thereto; and (iv) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Effective
Time Holder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in any
Further Distributions.

(d) _Replacement_. The Securityholders Agent (i) may resign at any time upon
thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Advisory Group or (ii) may be
removed and replaced by consent of those Effective Time Holders who
contributed at least fifty percent (50%) of the Indemnity Escrow. If the
Securityholders Agent shall be removed by the Effective Time Holders, or
shall die, resign, become disabled or otherwise be unable to fulfill its
responsibilities hereunder, the Effective Time Holders shall (by consent of
those Persons who contributed at least fifty percent (50%) of the Indemnity
Escrow), within ten (10) days after such removal, death, disability or
inability, appoint a successor to the Securityholders Agent and
immediately thereafter notify Parent of the identity of such successor. Any
such successor shall succeed the Securityholders Agent as Securityholders
Agent hereunder. If for any reason there is no Securityholders Agent at any
time, all references herein to the Securityholders Agent shall be deemed to
refer to the Effective Time Holders.

(e) _Expense Fund_. The Expense Fund shall be used (i) for the purposes of
paying directly, or reimbursing the Securityholders Agent for, any expenses
incurred by the Securityholders Agent pursuant to this Agreement and any
other agreement, document or instrument referred to in or contemplated by
this Agreement and any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or any
such other agreement, document or instrument, or (ii) as otherwise determined
by the Advisory Group. The Securityholders Agent will hold these funds
separate from its other funds, will not use these funds for its operating
expenses or any other purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Securityholders
Agent is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations or advice
and shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the
Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Securityholders Agent is not acting as a withholding agent or
in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense Fund, and has no tax
reporting or income distribution obligations. The Effective Time Holders will
not receive any interest on the Expense Fund and assign to the
Securityholders Agent any such interest. Subject to prior written consent by
the Advisory Group, the Securityholders Agent may, as reasonably
necessary, contribute funds to the Expense Fund from any Further
Distributions otherwise distributable to the Effective Time Holders. As soon
as practicable following the completion of the Securityholders Agents
responsibilities, the Securityholders Agent shall disburse the balance of
the Expense Fund to the Effective Time Holders in proportion to their
respective Pro Rata Share in such manner as the Securityholders Agent
determines reasonably appropriate, including, if the Securityholders Agent
elects, through a paying agent for further distribution.

(f) _Access_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide the Securityholders Agent with reasonable
access to information about the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable
assistance of the officers and employees of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation for purposes of performing its duties and exercising its rights
under this Agreement, provided, that the Securityholders Agent shall treat
confidentially any nonpublic information about the Surviving
Corporation (except in connection with the performance by the
Securityholders Agent of its duties or the exercise of its rights under this
Agreement).

(g) _Limitation of Liability_. Certain Effective Time Holders have entered
into an engagement agreement with the Securityholders Agent to provide
direction to the Securityholders Agent in connection with its services under
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement and the
Securityholders Agent engagement agreement (such Effective Time Holders,
including their individual representatives and any advisory group formed on
behalf of the Company or the Effective Time Holders, collectively hereinafter
referred to as the " _Advisory Group_ "). Neither the Securityholders Agent
nor its members, managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and
employees nor any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the "
_Securityholders  Agent Group_"), shall be liable to any Effective Time
Holder for any action or failure to act in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Securityholders Agents responsibilities hereunder,
under the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement or under
any Securityholders Agent engagement agreement, unless and only to the
extent such action or failure to act constitutes gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Securityholders Agent shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the
Merger Consideration Certificate, (ii) rely upon any signature reasonably
believed by it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has
proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Effective Time Holder
or other party.

(h) _Indemnification_. The Effective Time Holders shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Securityholders Agent Group from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, costs, expenses (including fees,
disbursements and costs of counsel and other skilled professionals and in
connection with seeking recovery from insurers), judgments, fines or amounts
paid in settlement (collectively, the " _Securityholders  Agent Expenses_")
incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Securityholders Agent Group and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder, under the Escrow
Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement or under any Securityholders Agent
engagement agreement. Such Securityholders Agent Expenses may be recovered
first, from the Expense Fund, second, from any distribution of any Further
Distributions otherwise distributable to the Effective Time Holders at the
time of distribution, and third, directly from the Effective Time Holders. The
Effective Time Holders acknowledge that the Securityholders Agent shall not
be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties
or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying
Agent Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby. Furthermore, the
Securityholders Agent shall not be required to take any action unless the
Securityholders Agent has been provided with funds, security or indemnities
which, in its reasonable determination, are sufficient to protect the
Securityholders Agent against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may
be incurred by the Securityholders Agent in performing such actions.

11.2 Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be
delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents,
and shall take such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request
(prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of carrying out or
evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

11.3 No Waiver Relating to Claims for Fraud. The Liability of any Person under
_Section 10_ will be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other
Liability that such Person may have at law or in equity based on such Persons
fraudulent acts or omissions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, none of the provisions set forth in this
Agreement, including the provisions set forth in _Section 10_, shall be
deemed a waiver by any party to this Agreement of any right or remedy which
such party may have at law or in equity based on any other Persons
fraudulent acts or omissions, nor will any such provisions limit, or be deemed
to limit: (a) the amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any claim for fraud
against such other Person; (b) the time period during which a claim for fraud
may be brought against such other Person; or (c) the recourse which any such
party may seek against such other Person with respect to a claim for fraud.

however_ , that the foregoing shall not preclude communications or disclosures
necessary to implement the provisions of this Agreement. Following the
Effective Time, neither the Securityholders Agent nor any of its Affiliates
shall make any press release or other public announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent that
such party shall be so obligated by law, in which case such party shall advise
Parent thereof and the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued.

 

11.18 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other agreements referred to
herein set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings among or between any of the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree

matter of such disclosure (without reference to any document referred to

terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words

exclusive. Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to
"Sections," "Schedules" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer to Sections of
