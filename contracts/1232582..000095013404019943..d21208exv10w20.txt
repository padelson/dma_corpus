Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1. Nothing in this Section 9.3(b)(ii) shall
limit (1) the indemnitee\'s right not to proceed to and conclude Closing
hereunder or terminate pursuant to and in accordance with Article X or (2)
the indemnification obligations of an indemnitor other than with respect to
those described in this Section 9.3(b)(ii).   For purposes of certainty, set
forth below are three illustrations as to the manner in which the foregoing
provisions of this Section 9.3(b)(ii) would operate:   Illustration No. 1
(Post-Signing Period Breaches of $4.5 million)   If (A) as of the Effective
Date, Company had knowledge of one or more circumstances that would otherwise
provide a claim for indemnification but for the application of this Section
9.3(b)(ii) (each a "Breach") in this Agreement ("Pre-Signing Breaches"), (B)
between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, the Company obtains
knowledge of one or more Breaches made by the Owners in this Agreement or

("Post-Singing Breaches"), the Losses in respect of which are $4.5 million,
and (C) notwithstanding such Pre-Signing Breaches and Post-Signing Breaches
and the Losses in respect thereof, Company elects to complete the
Transactions, then (a) Owners shall not be obligated, liable or responsible
to Company for any Losses in respect of the Pre-Signing Breaches, (b) Owners
shall be liable with respect to the first $2.0 million of such Losses in
respect of Post-Signing Breaches ($200,000 of which shall be applied to
the Threshold with respect to any applicable representations and warranties),
and (y) to the extent that the amount of such Losses is agreed upon prior
to Closing, the same shall be credited against the Sale Consideration and (z)
to the extent that the amount of such Losses is not agreed upon prior to
Closing, such Losses shall be subject to indemnification in favor of Company
pursuant to Section 9.1, and (c) Owners shall not be obligated, liable or
responsible to Company for the remaining $2.5 million of Losses in excess of
$2.0 million.   Illustration No. 2 (Post-Signing Period Breaches of $2.0
million)   If (A) as of the Effective Date, Company had knowledge of one
or more Pre-Signing Breaches, (B) between the Effective Date and the Closing
Date, Company obtains knowledge of one or more Post-Signing Breaches, the
Losses in respect of which are $2.0 million, and (C) notwithstanding such
Pre-Signing Breaches and Post-Signing Breaches and the Losses in respect
thereof, Company elects to complete the Transactions, then (a) Owners shall
not be obligated, liable or responsible to Company for any Losses in respect
of the Pre-Signing Breaches, and (b) Owners shall be liable with respect to
$2.0 million of such Losses in respect of Post-Signing Breaches ($200,000 of
which shall be applied to the Threshold with respect to any applicable
representations and warranties), and (y) to the extent that the amount of
such Losses is agreed upon prior to Closing, the same shall be credited
against the Sale Consideration and (z) to the extent that the amount of such
Losses is not agreed upon prior to Closing, such Losses shall be subject to
indemnification in favor of Company pursuant to Section 9.1.   Illustration
No. 3 (Post-Signing Period Breaches of $100,000)   If (A) as of the
Effective Date, Company had knowledge of one or more Pre-Signing Breaches,
(B) between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, Company obtains  
54   knowledge of one or more Post-Signing Breaches, the Losses in respect
of which are $100,000, and (C) notwithstanding such Pre-Signing Breaches,
and Post-Signing Breaches and the Losses in respect thereof, Company elects
to complete the Transactions, then (a) Owners shall not be obligated, liable
or responsible to Company for any Losses in respect of the Pre-Signing
Breaches, and (b) the amount of Losses in respect of Post-Signing Breaches
($100,000) shall be applied to the Threshold with respect to any applicable
representations and warranties and shall be subject to indemnification in
favor of Company pursuant to Section 9.1 (but only to the extent that
additional Losses resulting from one or more Breaches hereunder are
discovered by Company after the Closing, but before the expiration of the
survival periods set forth in Section 9.3(a), exceed $100,000).   (c) (i)
Neither Owners, on the one hand, nor Company, on the other hand, shall have
any liability under Section 9.1(a)(i) (other than claims relating to Section
3.2(c)) or Section 9.2(a)(i), respectively, unless, in each case, the
aggregate of all Losses relating thereto for which either such Parties would,
but for this proviso, in the aggregate be liable exceeds on a
cumulative basis an amount equal to Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000)
(the "Threshold"), subject to reduction on account of previous Post-Signing
Breaches relating to applicable representations and warranties as provided
above, and then to the extent of all of such Losses (i.e., from the first
dollar of such Losses); and (ii) such Party\'s aggregate liability under such
Sections shall in no event exceed Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) (the
"Cap").   (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
(i) except in the case of actual fraud by a Party, the liability of each
Party resulting from the breach or default by such Party shall be limited to
actual damages incurred by the injured Party and (ii) except in the case of
actual fraud by a Party, the Parties waive their rights to recover from the
other Parties consequential, punitive, exemplary, and speculative damages or
any other remedies available in contract, tort, law or otherwise. The Parties
shall have the right to adjust the Sale Consideration by the reasonably
estimated amount of (i) any indemnification claims for Losses resulting from
any inaccuracy, breach or violation of any representation or warranty made by
a Party in this Agreement which in the aggregate exceed the Threshold and
that become known between the Effective Date and the Closing Date and (ii)
any other indemnification claims known at Closing, and in respect of both (i)
and (ii) other than any such claims that expressly do not survive
Closing.   (e) Recourse: The indemnity obligation of the Operating
Partnership, on one hand, and Owners, on the other hand, shall be with full
recourse to the indemnifying party. In addition, Owners\' indemnification
obligations shall also provide recourse as follows: First to the collateral
that remains subject to the Pledge Agreements, and then, to the extent that
such obligations are unsatisfied from such collateral, to the Guaranty.  
9.4 Notification of Claims.   (a) A Person that may be entitled to be
indemnified under this Agreement (the "Indemnified Party"), shall promptly
notify the Party liable for such indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party")
in writing of any pending or threatened claim or demand that the Indemnified
Party has determined has given or could reasonable give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending or threatened claim
or demand   55   asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party,
such claim being a "Third Party Claim"), describing in reasonable detail the
facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or
demand; provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article
IX except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure,
except that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation or
warranty must be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable period
specified in Section 9.3(a) for giving written notification.   (b) Upon
receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified Party
pursuant to Article IX, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to assume the defense and control of any Third Party Claim
and the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and
at its own expense. Each Owner or Company, as the case may be, shall, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates to cooperate fully with the Indemnifying
Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party does not, within ten Business Days after notice of
any Third Party Claim, assume the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of
such Third Party Claim at the expense and for the account of the Indemnifying
Party, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party at any time prior to the compromise, settlement or final
determination thereof. The Indemnifying Party shall be authorized to consent
to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third
Party Claim that does not require any admission of liability by the
Indemnified Party without the consent of any Indemnified Party, provided that
the Indemnifying Party shall (i) pay (up to the Cap, if applicable) or cause
to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment
concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement, (ii) not encumber any
of the assets of any Indemnified Party or agree to any restriction or
condition that would apply to or adversely affect the conduct of any
Indemnified Party\'s business and (iii) obtain, as a condition of
any settlement or other resolution, a complete and unconditional release of
any Indemnified Party from all liability with respect to such Third Party
Claim.   (c) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives a notice of a
claim for indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to Article IX that
does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party within 30 days following its receipt of such notice if the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under this
Article IX. If the Indemnifying Party does not so notify the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected the claim
specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice.   ARTICLE X

Operating Partnership, if there has been a material violation or breach by
Owners of any covenant contained in this Agreement or a material inaccuracy,
violation or breach of any representation or warranty contained in Section
3.2(c) and such inaccuracy, violation or breach has not been waived by the
Company and, in any such case, has not been cured by Owners within ten (10)
days after written notice thereof from Company or Operating Partnership (and,
in such event, Company and Operating Partnership shall have the option of (i)

Company/Operating Partnership and Owners shall have the option to extend the
Outside Date on five (5) days prior written notice to the other Party up to
thirty (30) days, if the sole reason that the Closing has not occurred is due

believes that such closing conditions can be satisfied within such extension
period; provided further that, in each case, the terminating Party is not in

received from such condemnation, if any, and any Insurance Policies or any
insurance policies of the Company or the Operating Partnership provided,
however, if Company and/or Operating Partnership exercise its right to

receive any proceeds, awards, credits or other payments arising under
Sections 8.1 or 8.2.   58    10.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of
termination of this Agreement automatically or by any Party as provided
above, the provisions of this Agreement shall immediately become void and of
no further force and effect, and, subject to the delivery of the Deposit to
the Party entitled thereto hereunder, no Party shall have any further rights
or obligations under this Agreement except for those expressly stated to
survive the termination hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Deposit shall be returned to Operating Partnership in all
events of termination of this Agreement except to the extent any such
termination is solely the result of a breach by Operating Partnership and/or
Company. Except in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 10.1(c)
above, no Party shall have any obligation to reimburse the other Party or
Parties for any of the expenses incurred by such Party or Parties in
connection with this Transaction, including but not limited to those
described in Section 7.5 above.   ARTICLE XI  TAX PROTECTION   11.1
Restrictions on Transfer of Contributed Properties/Reduction of Indebtedness
by Company.   (a) Company by this Agreement agrees that, during the
Protected Period, it shall not nor shall it cause the Operating Partnership
or any of their subsidiaries to sell, transfer, exchange or otherwise dispose
of all or any portion of their interest in the Contributed Properties, or
engage in a merger, sale of all or substantially all of its assets or a
liquidation or dissolution of Company, Operating Partnership or any of
Company\'s or Operating Partnership\'s subsidiaries, if as a result of which
a Beneficial Owner or its Protected Transferees will recognize any Built-in-
Gain for federal income tax purposes (a "Taxable Event"). Company by this
Agreement further agrees that in the event it causes a Taxable Event to occur
at any time during the Protected Period, Company shall pay or shall cause the
Operating Partnership or their subsidiaries to pay to each affected
Beneficial Owner and its Protected Transferees an amount equal to the Taxable
Event Payment (as defined below). Upon the occurrence of a Taxable Event,
Operating Partnership shall promptly notify the affected Beneficial Owner and
each of its Protected Transferees to the extent the identity and address of
such Protected Transferee is known by Operating Partnership. Upon the later
of (i) 10 Business Days of the receipt by Operating Partnership from the
Beneficial Owner or Protected Transferee of the information required to
determine the Taxable Event Payment or (ii) 10 Business Days before the next
estimated tax payment is due; the Operating Partnership will pay the
applicable Taxable Event Payment by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the applicable Person. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Taxable Event Payment" means as to each affected Beneficial Owner
or Protected Transferee an amount equal to the sum of (i) the federal, state,
and local income Taxes payable by such person resulting from the recognition
of Built-in-Gain as a result of the occurrence of the Taxable Event (taking
into account the deductibility of state and local taxes for federal and state
tax purposes) and (ii) an additional payment in an amount equal to the amount
such that, after payment by such Person of all Taxes (taking into account
the deductibility of state and local taxes for federal and state tax
purposes) on amounts received under clause (i) and this clause (ii), such
Person retains an amount equal to the amount described in clause (i).  
59    (b) Company covenants that the "traditional method"
(without curative allocations), as defined in Treas. Reg. 1.704-3(b), of
allocating income, gain, loss and deduction to account for the variation
between the fair market value and adjusted basis of the property for federal
income tax purposes, shall be used (i) with respect to the contribution of
the Contributed Properties, and (ii) with respect to any revaluation of the
Contributed Properties, pursuant to Treas. Reg. Sections
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g) and 1.704 3(a)(6).   (c) Company
covenants that, subject to the exceptions provided herein, it will not reduce
or cause a reduction in the indebtedness secured by the Contributed
Properties that would trigger gain or at-risk capture to a Beneficial Owner
or its Protected Transferees (except for gains resulting from normal
amortization of existing debt as provided on the amortization schedule
on Schedule 11.1(c) and income allocated pursuant to Section 704(c) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") due to amortization
and depreciation) during the Protected Period. Company by this Agreement
further agrees that in the event it breaches this covenant in Section 11.1(c)
during the Protected Period, Company shall pay or cause the Operating
Partnership or their subsidiaries to pay to each Beneficial Owner and its
Protected Transferees an amount equal to the Taxable Event Payment, computed
as if the events set forth in the preceding sentence were a Taxable
Event.   (d) No Taxable Event Payments or other liability or obligation
of Company or its affiliates shall be triggered pursuant to this Article XI
for any sale, transfer, distribution or disposition of the Properties other
than Contributed Properties or for any reduction of indebtedness secured by
the Properties other than Contributed Properties.   (e) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the restrictions, obligations and Liabilities of the Company and
its affiliates provided in this Article XI shall terminate and be of no force
or effect as to any Beneficial Owner and its Protected Transferees at such
time that the Unit Sales Limitation is not satisfied as to such Beneficial
Owner and its Protected Transferees. The making of a Taxable Event Payment by
the Company, the Operating Partnership or any of their affiliates under this
Section 11.1 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of a Owner, its
Beneficial Owners and its Protected Transferees with respect to any tax
liability incurred in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be construed to permit a party to receive a double benefit or
compensation respect to a Taxable Event (it being understood and agreed that
the payments referenced in clauses (i) and (ii) in the definition of Taxable
Event Payment in Section 11.1(a) above shall not be considered a "double
benefit".   (f) No Beneficial Owner or its Protected Transferees shall have
any right to participate in (i) any audit, conference or other proceeding
with the Internal Revenue Service or the relevant state or local authorities,
or any judicial proceedings concerning the determination of the tax liability
of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any of their subsidiaries, (ii)
any administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the
taxing authority in respect of any such proceeding or (iii) any compromise
or settlement of any adjustment or deficiency proposed, asserted or assessed
as a result of any such proceeding.   (g) Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Article XI and for the avoidance of doubt, the provisions
of this Article XI shall not apply to the Designated Properties,  
60   including any restrictions or limitations on the taxable disposition
of the Designated Properties or the prepayment, defeasance or other reduction
of the indebtedness applicable to the Designated Properties.   ARTICLE
