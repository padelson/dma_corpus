this Agreement that have not been finally determined as of such date
(including any potential Third-Party Claim referred to in _Section 10.05_,
whether or not such claim has actually been made or threatened against the
Indemnified Party) (the " _Outstanding Claims_ "), the number of OP Units
delivered to PELP (for the benefit of the Contributors) upon the Termination
Date shall be equal to the number of OP Units then held by the Escrow Agent
in the Escrow Account, less the number of OP Units equal to the sum of any
amounts subject to the Outstanding Claims divided by the Implied Valuation
(rounded up to the nearest whole number). If at any time after
the Termination Date or Statute of Limitations Termination Date, as
applicable, the number of OP Units then held by the Escrow Agent in the
Escrow Account exceeds the number of OP Units equal to the sum of any amounts
subject to the Outstanding Claims divided by the Implied Valuation (rounded
up to the nearest whole number), the Contributors' Representative and PEGC I
OP shall execute and deliver a certificate requesting the Escrow Agent to
deliver such excess number of OP Units to PELP (for the benefit of the
Contributors) and the Escrow Agent shall deliver to PELP (for the benefit of
the Contributors) such excess number of OP Units.

  



  

Section 1.05 _OP Unit Consideration Adjustments_.

  



  

(a) _Calculation of Estimates_. At least two (2) Business Days prior
to the close of business on the Closing Date, the
Contributors' Representative shall cause to be prepared and delivered to PEGC
I OP an unaudited balance sheet of the Contributed Companies, their
Subsidiaries and the Contributed Businesses as of 11:59 p.m. (New York City

(the " _Closing OP Unit Consideration Estimate_ ") setting forth (i) the
Contributors' Representative's estimate of (x) the Closing Specified Net

amount of Closing Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount_
") and (z) the Contribution Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated
Contribution Transaction Expenses_ ") and (ii) the Stated Value of New
Properties Acquired and the Debt Consent Adjustment Amount as mutually agreed
to by the parties hereto. The Closing OP Unit Consideration Estimate shall
reflect the Contributors' Representative's good faith estimate (based on
reasonable assumptions) of the Estimated Adjusted OP Unit Consideration,
calculated consistent with each of (1) the applicable definitions set forth in
this Agreement and (2) the Agreed Principles.

(b) _Calculation of Actual Adjusted OP Unit Consideration Amount_.

  



  

(i) Within ten (10) days following the Closing Date, PEGC I OP and the
Contributors' Representative shall appoint FTI Consulting, Inc. or, if such
firm refuses such assignment, a nationally recognized accounting firm that has
not performed work for, and is otherwise independent of, each of PEGC I OP,
the Contributed Companies, the Contributors and the
Contributors' Representative and that is reasonably acceptable to PEGC I OP
and the Contributors' Representative (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "),
to prepare and deliver to PEGC I OP and the Contributors' Representative
within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date a statement (the " _Actual
Adjusted OP Unit Consideration Statement_ ") setting forth the Independent
Accounting Firm's calculation of (x) (1) the Closing Specified Net Assets, (2)
the actual Closing Indebtedness (the " _Actual Closing Indebtedness_ ") and
(3) the Actual Contribution Transaction Expenses, (y) the Actual Adjusted OP
Unit Consideration Amount derived from such calculations and (z) the Stated
Value of New Properties Acquired and the Debt Consent Adjustment Amount set
forth on the Closing OP Unit Consideration Estimate. The Actual Adjusted OP
Unit Consideration Statement shall be calculated as of 11:59 p.m. (New York
City time) on the day before the Closing Date, consistent with each of (1) the
applicable definitions set forth in this Agreement, (2) the calculation of
the Stated Value of New Properties Acquired set forth on the Closing OP Unit
Consideration Estimate and (3) the Agreed Principles.

  



  

(ii) Each of the parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and Representatives to, provide full cooperation to the
Independent Accounting Firm, including providing the Independent Accounting
Firm with all relevant information, books and records and any work papers
relating to the preparation of the Actual Adjusted OP Unit Consideration
Statement and all other items reasonably requested by the Independent
Accounting Firm.

  



  

(iii) The engagement letter with the Independent Accounting Firm shall
stipulate that (w) prior to the delivery of the Actual Adjusted OP Unit
Consideration Statement, each of the Contributors' Representative and PEGC I
OP shall be entitled, upon reasonable notice to the Independent Accounting
Firm and the other party, to meet with the Independent Accounting Firm on one
or more occasions to present information or analysis that it deems relevant
to the calculation of the Actual Adjusted OP Unit Consideration Amount, (x)
the Independent Accounting Firm shall consider such information and analysis
in good faith prior to the delivery of the Actual Adjusted OP Unit
Consideration Statement, and if the Independent Accounting Firm elects not to
follow any such information and analysis, the Actual Adjusted OP Unit
Consideration Statement, or accompanying materials delivered concurrently
therewith, shall explain in reasonable detail the reasons the Independent
Accounting Firm so elected, (y) Representatives of the
Contributors' Representative and PEGC I OP shall be entitled to attend any
such meeting and (z) the calculation of the Actual Adjusted OP
Unit Consideration Amount shall be in all respects consistent with the
requirements therefor set forth in the last sentence of _Section 1.05(b)(i)_.

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

(iv) If either the Contributors' Representative or PEGC I OP disagrees
with the Independent Accounting Firm's calculations in the Actual Adjusted OP
Unit Consideration Statement, it shall notify the other party and the
Independent Accounting Firm of such disagreement in writing (the " _Notice of
Disagreement_ "), setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such
disagreement, within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Actual Adjusted
OP Unit Consideration Statement. Any Notice of Disagreement may reference
only disagreements based on mathematical errors or based on assertions that
the Independent Accounting Firm's calculation of the Actual Adjusted OP Unit
Consideration Amount is inconsistent with the requirements set forth in the
last sentence of _Section 1.05(b)(i)_. If neither the Contributors'
Representative nor PEGC I OP provides a Notice of Disagreement within such
thirty (30)-day period, the parties hereto shall be deemed to have agreed with
all calculations set forth on the Actual Adjusted OP Unit Consideration
Statement, which shall be final and binding on the parties hereto.

  



  

(v) If a Notice of Disagreement is timely provided, PEGC I OP (and/or
its Representatives) and the Contributors' Representative shall use their
reasonable best efforts for a period of ten (10) days (or such longer period
as they may mutually agree in writing) to resolve any disagreements set forth
on the Notice of Disagreement. If, at the end of such period, they are unable
to resolve all disagreements, then any remaining disagreements shall be
resolved by a nationally recognized accounting firm that has not
performed work for, and is otherwise independent of, each of PEGC I OP, the
Contributed Companies, the Contributors and the Contributors' Representative
and that is reasonably acceptable to PEGC I OP and the Contributors'
Representative (the " _Reviewing Accounting Firm_ ").

  



  

(vi) Each of PEGC I OP and the Contributors' Representative shall
promptly provide their respective assertions regarding the Actual Adjusted OP
Unit Consideration Statement and, to the extent relevant thereto, supporting
materials, in writing to the Reviewing Accounting Firm and to each other. The
Reviewing Accounting Firm shall be instructed to render its determination with
respect to all disagreements as soon as reasonably possible, but in any event
within sixty (60) days following the day on which the disagreement is
referred to the Reviewing Accounting Firm. The Reviewing Accounting Firm shall
base its determination solely on the written submissions of PEGC I OP and the
Contributors' Representative, and shall not conduct an independent
investigation. In resolving any disputed item, the Reviewing Accounting Firm
may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by PEGC I OP or the Contributors' Representative, or less than
the smallest value for such item claimed by either PEGC I OP or the
Contributors' Representative (except as necessary in the Reviewing Accounting
Firm's judgment to reflect the Reviewing Accounting Firm's resolution of
another disputed item). The determination of the Reviewing Accounting
Firm shall be final and binding on the parties hereto. PEGC I OP and the
Contributors' Representative shall reflect those determinations in a revised
Actual Adjusted OP Unit Consideration Statement, and such statement, as
revised, shall thereafter be for all purposes under this Agreement the
"Actual Adjusted OP Unit Consideration Statement" and the Actual Adjusted OP
Unit Consideration Amount set forth thereon shall thereafter be for all
purposes under this Agreement the " _Actual Adjusted OP Unit
Consideration Amount_."

(vii) All expenses relating to the engagement of the Independent
Accounting Firm and the Reviewing Accounting Firm in connection with this 
_Section 1.05_ shall be paid by PEGC I OP, but borne equally by PEGC I OP and
the Contributors (as provided in _clause (c)_ below).

  



  

(c) Promptly following the determination of the Actual Adjusted OP Unit
Consideration Amount, in the event that the Actual Adjusted OP
Unit Consideration Amount is: (i) less than the Estimated Adjusted OP Unit
Consideration Amount (such difference, a " _Shortfall Amount_ "), PELP (on
behalf of the Contributors) shall deliver to PEGC I OP an aggregate number of
OP Units (rounded up to the nearest whole number) equal to (x) the sum of the
Shortfall Amount plus the expenses of the Contributors contemplated in 
_Section 1.05(b)(vii)_ , divided by (y) the Implied Valuation (rounded up to
the nearest whole number), together with an amount in cash equal to any
distributions paid on such number of OP Units from the Closing through the
date the Shortfall Amount is so delivered; or (ii) greater than the Estimated
Adjusted OP Unit Consideration Amount (such excess, an " _Excess Amount_
"), PEGC I OP or its agent shall deliver to PELP (for the benefit of the
Contributors) an aggregate number of OP Units (rounded up to the nearest
whole number) as is equal to (A) the difference of (x) the Excess Amount, less
the expenses of the Contributors contemplated in _Section 1.05(b)(vii)_ ,
divided by (B) the Implied Valuation, together with an amount in cash equal to
any distributions paid on such amount of OP Units from the Closing through
the date the Excess Amount is so delivered.

  



  

Section 1.06 _Earn-Out_. In addition to the Closing Consideration received
pursuant to _Sections 1.03_ and _1.05_ , the Contributors shall be entitled
to receive additional OP Units in accordance with the terms set forth in this
_Section 1.06_ (the " _Contingent Consideration_ ").

  



  

(a) _Contingent Consideration_. PEGC I OP shall issue and deliver to
PELP (for the benefit of the Contributors) Contingent Consideration
in connection with: (x) equity capital raised by PEGC III (the " _PEGC III
Earn-Out_ "); and (y) a Liquidity Event (the " _Liquidity Event Earn-Out_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the number of OP Units issued
in connection with the PEGC III Earn-Out and the Liquidity Event Earn-Out
exceed twelve million four hundred ninety thousand (12,490,196) OP Units in
the aggregate (the " _Contingent Consideration Cap_ "). The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the Contingent Consideration is, or will be
issued, for the benefit of the Contributors in exchange for the
contribution of tangible and intangible assets by the Contributors to PEGC I
OP at the Closing, the full value of which assets cannot be determined at the
time of the Closing.

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

(i) _PEGC III Earn-Out_.

  



  

(A) The Contributors shall earn Contingent Consideration in
connection with the PEGC III Earn-Out (the " _PEGC III Earn-Out Unit Amount_
") as follows:

  



  

(1) If the aggregate amount of equity capital (calculated on a gross
basis) received prior to December 31, 2019 by PEGC III through its issuance
of PEGC III Common Stock (the " _PEGC III Aggregate Equity Capital Amount_ ")
is greater than or equal to one billion, five hundred million dollars
($1,500,000,000), then the Contributors shall earn, subject to the Contingent
Consideration Cap, a PEGC III Earn-Out Unit Amount equal to eight million
(8,000,000) OP Units;

  



  

(2) If the PEGC III Aggregate Equity Capital Amount is greater than or
equal to five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) but less than one
billion, five hundred million dollars ($1,500,000,000), then the Contributors
shall earn, subject to the Contingent Consideration Cap, a PEGC III Earn-Out
Unit Amount equal to such number of OP Units (rounded up to the nearest whole
number) as is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the PEGC III
Qualifying Equity Capital Amount by one-hundred and twenty-five (125); or

  



  

(3) If the PEGC III Aggregate Equity Capital Amount is less than five
hundred million dollars ($500,000,000), then the Contributors shall earn no
PEGC III Earn-Out Unit Amount.

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
the PEGC III Advisory Agreement is terminated or otherwise amended in any
manner which would cause PEGC I and its Subsidiaries to no longer provide
PEGC III Services to PEGC III, the Contributors shall earn no PEGC III Earn-
Out Unit Amount with respect to any amounts of equity capital received by
PEGC III through its issuance of PEGC III Common Stock following such
termination or amendment.

  



  

(B) PEGC I OP shall issue and deliver to the Contributors' Representative
(for the benefit of the Contributors) annual consideration in connection with
the portions of the PEGC III Earn-Out Unit Amount earned in accordance with
this _Section 1.06(a)(i)_ during the calendar years 2017, 2018 and 2019;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the PEGC III Aggregate Equity Capital Amount
reaches one billion, five hundred million dollars ($1,500,000,000) on a date
prior to December 31, 2019 (the " _PEGC III Earn-Out Completion Date_ "), a
final delivery will be made as promptly as practicable thereafter for any
earned but undelivered portions of the PEGC III Earn-Out Unit Amount (each
annual delivery and the final delivery, if any, a " _PEGC III Earn-Out Unit
Delivery_ "). As promptly as practicable following each of December 31, 2017,
December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, or the PEGC III Earn-Out Completion
Date, if any, the Contributors' Representative shall prepare and deliver to
PEGC I OP a statement (each, a " _PEGC III Earn-Out Statement_ ") setting
forth in writing and in reasonable detail the number of OP Units comprising
the applicable PEGC III Earn-Out Unit Delivery, if any, deliverable to the
Contributors; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that PEGC I OP shall have the right,
in its sole and absolute discretion, to engage the Independent
Accounting Firm to review the accuracy of such statements in accordance with
_Section 1.06(c)_.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(C) At all times prior to December 31, 2019, in the event Jeffrey S.
Edison is not the Chief Executive Officer of PEGC I, PEGC I OP shall, and
shall cause PEGC I and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
managers and employees (i) to comply with the terms of the PEGC III Advisory
Agreement and use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the PEGC III
Services in good faith and in an economically rational manner that is
consistent with (x) reasonable business practices (including with respect to
capital expenditures and employee hires) and (y) the historical provision of
similar services by NTR I LLC under the Advisory Agreement, and (ii) not to
take any actions or fail to take any actions that are intended, or that have
the principal effect, of artificially decreasing the PEGC III Earnout.

  



  

(D) As a condition to consummating any Sale Event or MandA Event prior to
December 31, 2019, PEGC I OP shall require the terms of such Sale Event or
MandA Event to contain proper provisions such that the purchaser or surviving
entity, as applicable, of such Sale Event or MandA Event shall: (x) assume all
of PEGC I OP's remaining obligations with respect to the PEGC III Earn-Out
under this _Section 1.06(a)(i)_ ; and (y) permit the Contributors to continue
their efforts to raise equity capital for PEGC III in order to achieve the
PEGC III Earn-Out for the period of time between the closing of such Sale
Event or MandA Event through December 31, 2019 in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 1.06(a)(i)_.

  



  

(E) Notwithstanding the payment mechanics set forth in _Section
1.06(a)(i)(B)_ , if a Sale Event or MandA Event shall occur prior to
December 31, 2019, the Contributors' Representative and PEGC I OP shall each
use their reasonable best efforts to (x) agree, in good faith, on an amount
of OP Units of the PEGC III Earn-Out earned by the Contributors through the
closing date of such Sale Event or MandA Event, and (y) take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Contributors (or their designees) will be issued
and delivered such OP Units, with a view toward ensuring that such OP Units
will be given the opportunity to participate in the benefits of such Sale
Event or MandA Event to the same extent as other holders of OP Units.

  



  

(F) Subject to the approval of PEGC I OP in its sole and absolute
discretion, PEGC I OP may, at the request of the Contributors'
Representative, substitute an alternative earn-out (the " _Substituted Earn-
Out_ ") for the PEGC III Earn-Out if the economics to the Contributed
Companies, their Subsidiaries and the Contributed Businesses of the
Substituted Earn-Out are the same as, or better than, the economics to the
Contributed Companies, their Subsidiaries and the Contributed Businesses of
the PEGC III Earn-Out; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that PEGC I OP and PEGC I OP
shall have no obligation to consider such a substitution request and can
reject such a substitution request for any or no reason in PEGC I OP's sole
and absolute discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, any Substituted Earn-Out
shall also be subject to the Contingent Consideration Cap on the same terms
and in the same manner as the PEGC III Earn-Out.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(ii) _Liquidity Event Earn-Out_.

  



  

(A) The Contributors shall earn Contingent Consideration in
connection with the Liquidity Event Earn-Out (the " _Liquidity Event Earn-Out
Unit Amount_ ") as follows:

  



  

(1) If PEGC I achieves a Liquidity Event prior to December 31, 2019,
then the Contributors shall earn, subject to the Contingent
Consideration Cap, a Liquidity Event Earn-Out Unit Amount equal to:

  



  

a. Five million (5,000,000) OP Units, if the Liquidity Event involves a
Liquidity Event Price Per Share greater than or equal to ten dollars and
twenty cents ($10.20);

  



  

b. Such number of OP Units (rounded up to the nearest whole number) as
is equal to three million (3,000,000) plus the product of (x) the quotient
obtained by dividing the Liquidity Event Price Per Share Spread by one dollar
and forty cents ($1.40) and (y) two million (2,000,000), if the Liquidity
Event involves a Liquidity Event Price Per Share greater than or equal to
eight dollars and eighty cents ($8.80) but less than ten dollars and twenty
cents ($10.20); or

  



  

c. Three million (3,000,000) OP Units if the Liquidity Event involves a
Liquidity Event Price Per Share of less than eight dollars and eighty cents
($8.80);

  



  

(2) If PEGC I achieves a Liquidity Event between January 1, 2020 and
December 31, 2020, then the Contributors shall earn, subject to
the Contingent Consideration Cap, a Liquidity Event Earn-Out Unit Amount
equal to two-thirds (2/3) of the Liquidity Event Earn-Out Unit Amount that
would otherwise have been earned if the Liquidity Event had been achieved
prior to December 31, 2019 in accordance with _Section 1.06(a)(ii)(A)(1)_
above (rounded up to the nearest whole number);

  



  

(3) If PEGC I achieves a Liquidity Event between January 1, 2021 and
December 31, 2021, then the Contributors shall earn, subject to
the Contingent Consideration Cap, a Liquidity Event Earn-Out Unit Amount
equal to one-third (1/3) of the Liquidity Event Earn-Out Unit Amount that
would otherwise have been earned if the Liquidity Event had been achieved
prior to December 31, 2019 in accordance with _Section 1.06(a)(ii)(A)(1)_
above (rounded up to the nearest whole number); or

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

(4) If PEGC I achieves a Liquidity Event after December 31, 2021, then
the Contributors shall earn no Liquidity Event Earn-Out Unit Amount.

  



  

(B) PEGC I OP shall issue and deliver to the Contributors'
Representative (for the benefit of the Contributors) consideration in
connection with the Liquidity Event Earn-Out Unit Amount earned in accordance
with this _Section 1.06(a)(ii)_ (the " _Liquidity Event Earn-Out Unit
Delivery_ " and, together with the PEGC III Earn-Out Unit Delivery, the "
_Earn-Out Unit Deliveries_ "). As promptly as practicable following a
Liquidity Event, the Contributors' Representative shall prepare and deliver to
PEGC I OP a statement (the " _Liquidity Event Earn-Out Statement_ " and,
together with the PEGC III Earn-Out Statements, the " _Earn-Out Statements_
") setting forth in writing and in reasonable detail the number of OP Units
comprising the Liquidity Event Earn-Out Unit Delivery, if any, deliverable to
the Contributors; _provided_ , _however_ , that PEGC I OP shall have the
right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to engage the Independent
Accounting Firm to review the accuracy of such statement in accordance with
_Section 1.06(c)_. Notwithstanding the payment mechanics set forth in this
_Section 1.06(a)(ii)(B)_ , if the Liquidity Event giving rise to the
Liquidity Event Earn-Out is a Sale Event or an MandA Event, the Contributors'
Representative and PEGC I OP each shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take all actions necessary to ensure that the Contributors (or their
designees) will be issued and delivered the OP Units payable in connection
with such Sale Event or MandA Event as of immediately prior to the consummation
of such Sale Event or MandA Event (but expressly conditioned on the closing
thereof), with a view toward ensuring that such OP Units will be given the
opportunity to participate in the benefits of the Sale Event or MandA Event to
the same extent as other holders of OP Units.

  



  

(C) In the event PEGC I OP or the Contributors' Representative
determines that any Extraordinary Transaction prior to December 31, 2021
results in a dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits
intended to be made available to the Contributors under the Liquidity Event
Earn-Out, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith and consider such
factors as may be reasonably appropriate to equitably adjust the Liquidity
Event Earn-Out to take into account the effects of such Extraordinary
Transaction.

  



  

(b) _Access to Information_. Upon or prior to the delivery of an Earn-
Out Statement, the Contributors' Representative and the
Independent Accounting Firm (if engaged by PEGC I OP in accordance with
_Section 1.06(c)_ ) shall be entitled to, and PEGC I OP shall, and shall
cause its respective Affiliates and Representatives to, provide full
cooperation to the Contributors' Representative and the Independent
Accounting Firm, including providing the Contributors' Representative and the
Independent Accounting Firm with all relevant information, books and records
and any work papers relating to the preparation of such Earn-Out
Statement and all other items reasonably requested by the Contributors'
Representative or the Independent Accounting Firm.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

(c) _Disputes of Earn-Out Statements_.

  



  

(i) Within fifteen (15) days following the delivery of an Earn-Out
Statement by the Contributors' Representative, PEGC I OP may deliver to the
Contributors' Representative a written notice (a " _Notice of Review_ ")
setting forth, in reasonable detail and to the extent practicable, specific
amounts in the Earn-Out Statement that PEGC I OP would like the
Independent Accounting Firm to review and revise (to the extent that the
Independent Accounting Firm deems such revisions necessary to comply with the
provisions of this _Section 1.06_ ) (the " _Disputed Earn-Out Amount_ "). PEGC
I OP shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to reach its conclusions
regarding the Disputed Earn-Out Amount and, based thereon, the amount of
Contingent Consideration, within sixty (60) days after its appointment and
provide a written explanation of its decision (the " _Disputed Earn-Out
Statement_ ").

  



  

(ii) The engagement letter with the Independent Accounting Firm shall
stipulate that (w) prior to the delivery of the Disputed Earn-Out Statement,
the Contributors' Representative and PEGC I OP shall be entitled, upon
reasonable notice to the Independent Accounting Firm and the other party, to
meet with the Independent Accounting Firm on one or more occasions to present
information or analysis that it deems relevant to the calculation of the
Disputed Earn-Out Amount, (x) the Independent Accounting Firm shall consider
such information and analysis in good faith prior to the delivery of the
Disputed Earn-Out Statement, and if the Independent Accounting Firm elects
not to follow any such information and analysis, the Disputed Earn-Out
Statement, or accompanying materials delivered concurrently therewith, shall
explain in reasonable detail the reasons the Independent Accounting Firm so
elected, (y) Representatives of the Contributors' Representative and PEGC I
OP shall be entitled to attend any such meeting and (z) the calculation
of the Disputed Earn-Out Amount shall be in all respects consistent with the
requirements in this _Section 1.06_.

  



  

(iii) If either the Contributors' Representative or PEGC I OP disagrees
with the Independent Accounting Firm's calculations in the Disputed Earn-Out
Statement, it shall notify the other party and the Independent Accounting Firm
of such disagreement in writing (" _Notice of Earn-Out Disagreement_ "),
setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such
disagreement, within fifteen (15) days after its receipt of the Disputed
Earn-Out Statement. Any Notice of Earn-Out Disagreement may reference only
disagreements based on mathematical errors or based on assertions that the
Independent Accounting Firm's calculation of the Disputed Earn-Out Amount is
inconsistent with the requirements set forth in this _Section 1.06_. If
neither the Contributors' Representative nor PEGC I OP provides a Notice of
Earn-Out Disagreement within such fifteen (15)-day period, the parties
hereto shall be deemed to have agreed with all calculations set forth on the
Disputed Earn-Out Statement, which shall be final and binding on the parties
hereto.

  



  

(iv) If a Notice of Earn-Out Disagreement is timely provided, all
remaining disagreements shall be resolved by the Reviewing Accounting Firm.

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

(v) Each of the Contributors' Representative and PEGC I OP shall
promptly, provide their respective assertions regarding the Disputed Earn-Out
Statement and, to the extent relevant thereto, supporting materials, in
writing to the Reviewing Accounting Firm and to each other. The Reviewing
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to render its determination with respect
to all disagreements as soon as reasonably possible, but in any event within
thirty (30) days following the day on which the disagreement is referred
to the Reviewing Accounting Firm. The Reviewing Accounting Firm shall base
its determination solely on the written submissions of PEGC I OP and the
Contributors' Representative, and shall not conduct an independent
investigation. In resolving any disputed item, the Reviewing Accounting Firm
may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either PEGC I OP or the Contributors' Representative, or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either PEGC I OP or the
Contributors' Representative (except as necessary in the Reviewing Accounting
Firm's judgment to reflect the Reviewing Accounting Firm's resolution of
another disputed item). The determination of the Reviewing Accounting
Firm shall be final and binding on the parties hereto. PEGC I OP and the
Contributors' Representative shall reflect those determinations in a revised
Disputed Earn-Out Statement, and such statement, as revised, shall thereafter
be for all purposes under this Agreement the " _Disputed Earn-Out Statement_
" and the Contingent Consideration set forth thereon shall be thereafter
be for all purposes under this Agreement the " _Contingent Consideration_."

  



  

(vi) All expenses relating to the engagement of the Independent
Accounting Firm and the Reviewing Accounting Firm in connection with this 
_Section 1.06_ shall be paid by PEGC I OP, but borne equally by PEGC I OP and
the Contributors (as provided in _clause (d)_  below).

  



  

(d) _Earn-Out Unit Deliveries_. Within fifteen (15) days following the
delivery of an Earn-Out Statement by the Contributors' Representative, PEGC I
OP shall issue and deliver to PELP (for the benefit of the Contributors) the
Earn-Out Unit Delivery, if any, set forth on the Earn-Out Statement with
respect to all amounts that are not under review by the Independent Accounting
Firm in accordance with _Section 1.06(c)_ (an " _Undisputed Earn-Out Amount_
"). In addition, in the event a Notice of Review is timely delivered pursuant
to _Section 1.06(c)_ , then, within five (5) days after the date that the
calculation of an Earn-Out Unit Delivery becomes final pursuant to _Section
1.06(c)_ , (i) PEGC I OP shall deliver to PELP (for the benefit of the
Contributors) the Earn-Out Unit Delivery less any Undisputed Earn-Out Amount
previously delivered by PEGC I OP to PELP (for the benefit of the
Contributors). The Contributors' Representative shall cause the Contributors'
share of the Independent Accounting Firm's and the Reviewing Accounting
Firm's expenses contemplated in _Section 1.06(c)(vi)_  to be satisfied by
delivery of a number of OP Units equal to (x) such expenses divided by the
Implied Valuation (rounded up to the nearest whole number). With each Earn-
Out Unit Delivery, PEGC I OP shall also deliver an amount in cash equal to any
distributions paid on such amount of OP Units from the date of the Earn-Out
Statement relating to such OP Units through the date such OP Units are so
delivered.

  



  

(e) _No Security_. The parties hereto understand and agree that: (i)
the contingent rights to receive any Earn-Out Unit Delivery shall not be
represented by any form of certificate or other instrument, are not
transferable, except by operation of Laws relating to descent and
distribution, divorce and community property, and do not constitute an equity
or ownership interest in PEGC I or PEGC I OP; (ii) the Contributors shall not
have any rights as a securityholder of PEGC I or PEGC I OP as a result of the

Section 1.07 _Treatment of New Properties Acquired_. If, prior to the
Closing, PELP or any of its Subsidiaries acquires real estate assets
constituting New Properties Acquired, including through an exchange
transaction qualifying under Section 1031 (or any successor statute) of the
Code (a " _1031 Exchange_ "), subject to Section 6.01(a)(xvii), then at the
Closing such properties will be deemed Owned Real Property or Ground Leased
Real Property (as applicable), any entity owning such properties at the
Closing shall be a Contributed Company, and the aggregate Stated Value of New
Properties Acquired on the Closing OP Unit Consideration Estimate will
reflect an increase equal to the Stated Value of such New Properties Acquired.
For the avoidance of doubt, any Indebtedness incurred in connection with New
Properties Acquired will be included in Closing Indebtedness.

  



  

Section 1.08 _Treatment of PEGC I Class B Units_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of the PEGC I OP Partnership
Agreement (including full satisfaction of all performance hurdles set forth
therein), the parties anticipate that at the Closing all Restricted Class B
Units in PEGC I OP will become Unrestricted Class B Units in PEGC I OP and,
to the extent the requirements for conversion of such Unrestricted Class B
Units to OP Units under the PEGC I OP Partnership Agreement are satisfied,
such Unrestricted Class B Units will automatically convert to OP Units
pursuant to the terms of the PEGC I OP Partnership Agreement. The parties
agree to, prior to the Closing, work together to determine; (i) whether the
requirements set forth in the PEGC I OP Partnership Agreement (including those
in Section 16.2(a) thereof) for the Restricted Class B Units' becoming
Unrestricted Class B Units have been or will be satisfied and, as a result,
whether the Restricted Class B Units in PEGC I OP will become Unrestricted
Class B Units in PEGC I OP; and (ii) whether the requirements for conversion
of such Unrestricted Class B Units in PEGC I OP to OP Units under the PEGC I
OP Partnership Agreement (including those in Section 16.4 thereof) are
satisfied and if so, how many Unrestricted Class B Units will automatically be
converted to OP Units pursuant thereto.

  



  

(b) Such OP Units (i.e., Unrestricted Class B Units in PEGC I OP
converted to OP Units pursuant to _Section 1.08(a))_ held by NTR I LLC, which
is not a Contributed Company, are expected to be distributed to NTR I LLC's
direct and indirect owners in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization.

  



  

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of the PEGC I OP Partnership
Agreement, any remaining Unrestricted Class B Units held by NTR I LLC that
are not converted to OP Units will be retained by NTR I LLC, or distributed to
PELP and retained by PELP, until the requirements for conversion of such
Unrestricted Class B Units to OP Units under the PEGC I OP Partnership
Agreement (including those in Section 16.4 thereof) are satisfied, at which
time such Unrestricted Class B Units will automatically be converted to OP
Units pursuant thereto, and such OP Units are expected to be distributed to
NTR I LLC's or PELP's (as applicable) direct and indirect owners in
accordance with the Plan of Reorganization. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that after the Closing, any remaining
PEGC I Class B Units shall be handled in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the PEGC I OP Partnership Agreement.

17

 



    



  

(b) Each Contributor agrees that (i) this Agreement is not intended to,
and does not, create or impose any fiduciary or other similar duty on the

shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the opinions and advice of such
Persons and shall have no liability for any actions (or elections not to act)

such OP Units to PELP (for the benefit of the Contributors). PEGC I OP and
its Affiliates shall have no liability to any party arising from or in
connection with, the Contributors' Representative's determination of the
relative allocation among the Contributors of payments to or by the
Contributors under this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement, or any failure
by the Contributors' Representative to fulfill his obligations to the
Contributors.

  



  

(e) In the event the Contributors' Representative is unwilling or
unable to continue to act as the Contributors' Representative, PELP, or its
permitted assigns shall appoint his successor. Each successor Contributors'

Section 1.10 _Intended Tax Treatment_. Except to the extent reasonably agreed
upon by the Contributors' Representative and PEGC I OP, the parties intend
that (a) the Contributions shall be treated and reported for federal income
tax purposes as a tax-free contribution of property in exchange for OP Units
(including Contingent Consideration) under Section 721(a) of the Code (to
which the "traditional method" (without curative allocations) as set forth in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(b) shall be applied in respect of each
asset contributed in the Contributions) and, (b) to the extent any cash is
being paid by PEGC I OP to, directly or indirectly, the Contributors, such
cash payment shall be treated as a reimbursement of preformation capital
expenditures within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-4(d).
In addition, the parties agree that all liabilities to be repaid by PEGC I OP
at the Closing in connection with the Contributions are "qualified
liabilities" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-5 and
will be assumed (or taken subject to) by PEGC I OP prior to such repayment.
The parties agree to report the Contributions consistent with this intended
Tax treatment on all applicable income Tax returns, and no party shall take a
position on any applicable income Tax return that would be inconsistent with
the intended Tax treatment described in this _Section 1.10 _ unless otherwise
required by a final determination within the meaning of Section 1313 of the
Code.

  



  

Article II. 
  
  _Representations and Warranties Relating to Each Contributor_ 
  _and the Contributed Interests_

  



  

Except as set forth in the Schedules, each Contributor hereby represents and
warrants to PEGC I OP, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as
though made on the Closing Date, except to the extent such representations and
warranties expressly relate to another date (in which case as of such other
date), as follows:

  



  

Section 2.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Such Contributor is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite power and
authority to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and
assets, including the Contributed Interests, and to conduct its businesses as
presently conducted. Such Contributor has made available to PEGC I OP true
and complete copies of its certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or
comparable documents), in each case as amended through the date hereof.

  



  

Section 2.02 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. Such
Contributor has the requisite power and authority to execute this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or is specified to be, a party
and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery by such
Contributor of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or
is specified to be, a party and the consummation by such Contributor of the
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary limited liability
company or partnership actions by such Contributor. Such Contributor has duly
executed and delivered this Agreement and, at or before the Closing, such
Contributor will have duly executed and delivered each Ancillary Agreement to
which it is, or is specified to be, a party, and this Agreement constitutes,
and each Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or is specified to be, a party
will after the Closing constitute, assuming due and valid authorization,
execution and delivery hereof and thereof by PEGC I OP, its legal, valid and
binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,
except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other applicable Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting the enforcement
of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless
of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

Section 2.03 _No Conflicts; Consents_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.03_
, the execution and delivery by such Contributor of this Agreement do not,
the execution and delivery by such Contributor of each Ancillary Agreement to
which it is, or is specified to be, a party will not, and the consummation of
the Transactions and compliance by such Contributor with the terms hereof and
thereof will not contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation of or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give
rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation, or to loss of a material benefit under, or to increased,
additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements of any Person
under, or require any Consent of any Person under, or result in the creation
of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets
of such Contributor under, any provision of: (a) the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws (or comparable documents) of such Contributor; (b)
any Material Contract to which such Contributor is a party; or (c) any
Judgment or Law applicable to such Contributor. No material Consent or
Judgment of, or Filing with, any Governmental Entity is required to be
obtained or made by or with respect to such Contributor in connection with
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions or the ownership by PEGC I
OP of any Contributed Company following the Closing, other than: (x) Filings
and Consents under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
(the " _HSR Act_ "); (y) such Filings and Consents as may be required in
connection with the contribution of the Insurance Business as set forth on
_Schedule 7.01(a)_ ; and (z) such Filings and Consents as may be required in
connection with the Taxes described in  _Section 6.07_.

  



  

Section 2.04 _The Contributed Interests_. Other than as contemplated by the
Plan of Reorganization, such Contributor, directly or through one or more
wholly owned Subsidiaries, has good and valid title to the Contributed
Interests set forth next to such Contributor's name on _Exhibit A_ , free and
clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens. Assuming PEGC I OP has the
requisite power and authority to be the lawful owner of such Contributed
Interests, at Closing, upon Contributor's receipt of the Closing
Consideration, good and valid title to the Contributed Interests will pass to
PEGC I OP, free and clear of any Liens (other than Permitted Liens and liens
arising out of acts of PEGC I OP or its Affiliates). Other than this
Agreement, such Contributed Interests are not subject to any voting trust
agreement or other Contract, including any Contract restricting or
otherwise relating to the voting dividend rights or disposition of such
Contributed Interests.

  



  

Section 2.05 _Concentration of Ownership_. No Contributor, nor any Person to
which such Contributor may distribute OP Units as part of a post-Closing
distribution set forth on _Schedule 2.05_ (the " _Post-Closing Distributions_
"), shall collectively beneficially own greater than fifteen percent (15%) of
the fully diluted number of shares outstanding of PEGC I Common Stock
immediately following the Closing and the completion of the Post-Closing
Distributions.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

Section 2.06 _Accredited Investor; Investment Decision_. As of the Closing,
no Contributor, nor any Person to which such Contributor may distribute OP
Units, is a Non-Accredited Investor. Such Contributor acknowledges that it has
received such information as such Contributor deems necessary in order to
make an investment decision with regard to the OP Units.

  



  

Section 2.07 _U.S. Investor_. Such Contributor is a United States person (as
defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code).

  



  

Section 2.08 _Restricted Securities_. Such Contributor understands that the
OP Units have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act,
by reason of a specific exemption from the registration provisions of the
Securities Act, which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature
of the investment intent and the accuracy of each Contributor's
representations as expressed in this Agreement. Such Contributor understands
that the OP Units are "restricted securities" under applicable U.S.
federal and state securities Laws and that, pursuant to these Laws, such
Contributor must hold the OP Units indefinitely unless they are registered
with the SEC and qualified by state authorities, or an exemption from such
registration and qualification requirements is available. Such Contributor
acknowledges that PEGC I OP has no obligation to register or qualify the OP
Units for resale. Such Contributor further acknowledges that if an exemption
from registration or qualification is available, it may be conditioned
on various requirements, including, but not limited to, the time and manner
of sale, the holding period for the OP Units, and on requirements relating to
PEGC I OP, which are outside of such Contributor's control, and which PEGC I
OP is under no obligation, and may not be able, to satisfy. Such Contributor
acknowledges that the OP Units are subject to the terms of the PEGC I OP
Partnership Agreement, which has been filed with the SEC by PEGC I.

  



  

Section 2.09 _No Public Market_. Such Contributor understands that no public
market now exists for the OP Units, and that neither PEGC nor PEGC I OP has
made any representation that a public market will ever exist for the OP Units.

  



  

Section 2.10 _Legends_. Such Contributor understands that any certificate
representing the OP Units may bear any legend set forth in, or expressly
required by, the Ancillary Agreements or required by the PEGC I OP
Partnership Agreement or the following legend:

  



  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND
HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR IN CONNECTION
WITH, THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION THEREOF. NO SUCH TRANSFER MAY BE EFFECTED
WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATED THERETO OR AN OPINION OF
COUNSEL IN A FORM SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT
REQUIRED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES
LAWS."

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

Section 2.11 _No Additional Representations or Warranties_. Except as
provided in this _Article II_  and in _Article III_ , no Contributor nor any
of its Affiliates (other than the Contributors' Representative with
respect to _Article IV_ ), nor any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, stockholders, partners, members or representatives has made, or is
making, any representation or warranty whatsoever to PEGC I or PEGC I OP or
their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, stockholders,
partners, members or representatives in connection with the Transactions.

severally, represent and warrant to PEGC I OP, as of the date hereof and as

carry on its business as presently conducted. Each of the Contributed
Companies and Subsidiaries thereof is duly qualified and in good standing to
do business in each jurisdiction (with respect to jurisdictions which
recognize such concept) in which the conduct or nature of its business, or
the ownership, leasing or holding of its properties, makes such qualification
necessary; except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a significant impact on the business or operations of the
Contributed Companies, considered as a whole.

  



  

(b)  The Contributors, on behalf of each Contributed Company, have
delivered to PEGC I OP true and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws (or comparable documents), each as amended to date,
of such Contributed Company and each Subsidiary thereof.

more Contributed Companies or Subsidiaries thereof, free and clear of all
Liens other than Permitted Liens. No legend or other reference to any
purported Lien appears upon any certificate representing the
Contributed Interests or any equity interests or other securities of any
Subsidiary thereof. The Contributed Interests and all the outstanding shares
of capital stock of each Contributed Company Subsidiary are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to or issued in
violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal,
preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under any provision
of applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
documents) of any Contributed Company or Subsidiary thereof or any Contract
to which any Contributed Company or Subsidiary thereof is a party or
otherwise bound. There is no Voting Debt of any Contributed Company or
Subsidiary thereof. There are no Convertible Securities of any Contributed

Contributed Company has the requisite power and authority to execute and
deliver the Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or is specified to be, a
party and to consummate the Transactions to which it is, or is specified to

consummation by such Contributed Company of the Transactions to which it is,
or is specified to be, a party have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate, limited liability company or partnership actions by
such Contributed Company. Each Contributed Company at or before the Closing
will have duly executed and delivered each Ancillary Agreement to which it
is, or is specified to be, a party and each Ancillary Agreement to which it
is, or is specified to be, a party will after the Closing constitute,
assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery thereof by PEGC I
OP and other parties thereto, such Contributed Company's legal, valid and
binding obligation, enforceable against such Contributed Company
in accordance with its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect,
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general

require any Consent of any Person under, or result in the creation of any
Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of any
Contributed Company or Subsidiary thereof under, any provision of: (a) the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable documents) of any
Contributed Company or Subsidiary thereof; (b) any Contract or Benefit Plan to
which any Contributed Company or Subsidiary thereof is a party or by which
any of their respective properties or assets is bound; or (c) any
Permit, Judgment or Law applicable to any Contributed Company or Subsidiary
thereof or their respective properties or assets; except in each of clauses

the aggregate, a material effect on the business or operations of any
individual Contributed Company. No material Consent of, or Filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to

without the prior written consent of PEGC I and PEGC I OP, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (iv) each party shall

his or her heirs and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of PEGC I, PEGC I OP and the Contributed Companies
and their Subsidiaries and shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse
to the DandO Indemnified Parties (including their successors, assigns and

result in an adverse economic effect on PEGC I OP (or, if such amendment
would result in an adverse economic effect on PEGC I OP, the Contributors
shall indemnify PEGC I OP for such adverse economic effect) and shall not
delay the Closing to any material extent.

below) from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by such PEGC I
Indemnitee in connection with or arising from (i) Taxes imposed on any
Contributed Company or Subsidiary thereof or for which such Contributed
Company or such Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, as a result of having
been a member of a Contributed Company Group (including Taxes for which the
Contributed Company or any Subsidiary thereof may be liable pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or similar provisions of state, local or
foreign Law as a result of having been a member of a Contributed Company Group
and any Taxes resulting from the Contributed Company or any Subsidiary
thereof ceasing to be a member of any Contributed Company Group), (ii) Taxes
imposed on any Contributed Company or Subsidiary thereof, or for which any
Contributor or Contributed Company or Subsidiary thereof may otherwise be
liable, for any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing
Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date, (iii) any breach of any
representation or warranty of such Contributor or any Contributed Company or
Subsidiary thereof contained herein relating to Taxes, in any Ancillary
Agreement or any certificate or supplemental disclosures delivered pursuant
hereto or thereto (it being agreed and acknowledged by the parties that such
representations and warranties shall be deemed not qualified by any
references therein to materiality or to whether or not such breach results or
may result in a Contributor Material Adverse Effect or a Contributed Company
Material Adverse Effect solely for the purpose of calculating the amount of
Losses, but not for the purpose of determining whether there has been a breach
of such representations and warranties), and (iv) any breach of any covenant
of such Contributor or any Contributed Company or Subsidiary thereof
contained herein or in any Ancillary Agreement (other than the Tax Protection
Agreement) relating to Taxes; _provided_ , that (1) the Contributors shall
have no liability under this _Section 8.01(a)_ for Taxes to the extent
included or reflected in a contra-asset, liability or obligation accrued or
reserved for in the Audited Balance Sheet or included in the determination of

 and (2) the first (but not the sole) source of recovery under this _Section
8.01(a)_ shall be the Escrow Account.

  



  

(b) For purposes of _Section 8.01(a)_ , whenever it is necessary to
determine the liability for Taxes of a Contributed Company or any Subsidiary
thereof for a Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes of such
Contributed Company or Subsidiary thereof for the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall be determined by
assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two (2) taxable years or
periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which
began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date and items of
income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of such Contributed Company or
Subsidiary thereof for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two
(2) taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming
that the books of such Contributed Company or Subsidiary thereof were closed
at the close of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that exemptions,
allowances, deductions or Taxes that are calculated on an annual basis, such
as property Taxes and depreciation deductions, shall be apportioned between
such two taxable years or periods on a daily basis.

  



  

   

66

 



    



  

(c) The obligations of the Contributors under this _Section 8.01(a)_
shall be: (i) joint and several among the Contributors that are wholly-owned,
directly or indirectly, by PELP and (ii) otherwise individual and several with
respect to those Contributors listed on _Schedule 10.01(d)_.

  



  

(d) PEGC I OP shall be liable for and pay, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Contributor Indemnitee from and against any and all Losses
suffered or incurred by such Contributor Indemnitee in connection with or
arising from any breach of any covenant of PEGC I OP relating to Taxes
contained herein.

  



  

Section 8.02 _Tax Returns; Tax Refunds_.

  



  

(a) The Contributors shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when
due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns
that are required to be filed by or with respect to each Contributed Company
and Subsidiary thereof on or prior to the Closing Date and shall remit or
cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. PEGC I OP
shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) all other Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or
with respect to each Contributed Company and Subsidiary thereof after the
Closing Date and shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect
of such Tax Returns; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such Tax Return
relates to a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or to any
Straddle Period, PEGC I OP shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to the
Contributors' Representative for the Contributors' Representative's review and
approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the due date
(taking into account any extension) for the filing of such Tax Return.

  



  

(b) All Tax Returns that the Contributors are required to file or cause
to be filed in accordance with _Section 8.02(a)_ shall be prepared and filed
in a manner consistent with past practice and, on such Tax Returns, no
position shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is inconsistent
with positions taken, elections made or methods used in preparing and filing
similar Tax Returns in prior periods (including positions, elections or
methods that would have the effect of deferring income to periods
ending after the Closing Date or accelerating deductions to periods ending on
or before the Closing Date).

  



  

(c) PEGC I OP and its Affiliates shall promptly pay to the Contributors
any refunds received by PEGC I OP or any of its Affiliates for Taxes of the
Contributed Companies and their Subsidiaries attributable to any taxable year
or period that ends on or before the Closing Date or, with respect to any
Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including
the Closing Date.

PEGC I's management team, the Contributors' Representative shall notify PEGC
I OP in writing upon receipt by the Contributors' Representative or any of its
Affiliates of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or
foreign Tax audits or assessments relating to any taxable period ending on
or before the Closing Date or to any Straddle Period relating to a Tax
liability for which the Contributors would be required to indemnify PEGC I OP
pursuant to _Section 8.01_. If the Contributors' Representative is not a
member of PEGC I's management team, each of the Contributors' Representative
and PEGC I OP, as applicable, shall notify the other party in writing
upon receipt by the applicable party or any of its Affiliates (including, in
the case of PEGC I OP after the Closing Date, any Contributed Company or
Subsidiary thereof) of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state,
local or foreign Tax audits or assessments relating to any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date or to any Straddle Period relating to a
Tax liability for which the Contributors would be required to indemnify PEGC
I OP pursuant to _Section 8.01_.

  



  

(b) The Contributors shall have the sole right to represent the
Contributed Companies' and each Subsidiary thereof's interests in any Tax
audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to a Tax liability for
which the Contributors would be required to indemnify PEGC I OP pursuant to
_Section 8.01_ or that relates to a taxable year or period ending on or before
the Closing Date, and to employ counsel of the Contributors' choice at the
Contributors' expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Contributors shall
have no right to represent a Contributed Company's or Subsidiary thereof's
interests in any such Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding except
to the extent the Contributors' Representative shall have first notified PEGC
I OP in writing of Contributors' intention to do so and of the identity of
counsel, if any, chosen by the Contributors in connection therewith;
_provided_ , _further_ , that PEGC I OP and its representatives shall be
permitted, at PEGC I OP's expense, to be present at, and participate in, any
such audit or proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Contributors nor any Contributor Affiliate shall be entitled to settle, either
administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes
which could adversely affect the liability for Taxes of any Contributed
Company, Subsidiary thereof or Affiliate thereof for any period after the
Closing Date to any extent unless the Contributors have indemnified each PEGC
I Indemnitee against the effects of any such settlement (including the
imposition of income Tax deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis or cost
adjustments, the lengthening of any amortization or depreciation periods, the
denial of amortization or depreciation deductions or the reduction of loss or
credit carryforwards) and the Contributors have obtained the prior
written consent of PEGC I OP, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(c) PEGC I OP shall have the sole right to represent the Contributed
Companies' and each Subsidiary thereof's interests in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding relating to Tax liabilities other than
those for which the Contributors have exercised such right pursuant to
_Section 8.03(b)_ and to employ counsel of PEGC I OP's choice at PEGC I OP's
expense; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that to the extent such Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding relates to a Tax liability for which
the Contributors would be required to indemnify PEGC I OP pursuant to
_Section 8.01_ or that relates to a taxable year or period ending on or
before the Closing Date, PEGC I OP shall keep the Contributors' Representative
reasonably informed of the progress of such Tax audit or administrative or
court proceeding and shall not effect any settlement or compromise with
respect to which any Contributor is liable without obtaining the
Contributors' Representative's prior written consent thereto, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

   

68

 



    



  

(d) Nothing herein shall be construed to impose on PEGC I OP any
obligation to defend a Contributed Company or Subsidiary thereof in any
Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding.

  



  

Section 8.04 _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, each
Contributor and PEGC I OP shall (and shall cause their respective

reduce), or file Tax Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes

Taxes);

  



  

(b) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such
other party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with 
_Section 8.02_ , and in connection therewith, provide the other party with any

(e) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from
any taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request
with respect to any Taxes or Tax Returns of each Contributed Company and
Subsidiary thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that PEGC I OP shall only be
obligated to furnish copies of such correspondence to the Contributors'
Representative to the extent such audit or information request relates to
Taxes for which the Contributors may be liable under the terms of this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.05 _Termination of Tax Allocation Agreements_. Any Tax Sharing
Arrangement entered into by any Contributor or Contributor Affiliate, on
the one hand, and any Contributed Company or Subsidiary thereof, on the other
hand, shall be terminated as to such Contributed Company or Subsidiary on or
prior to the Closing, and after the Closing neither such Contributed Company
nor any Subsidiary thereof shall have any liability thereunder.

(i) unless the aggregate of all Losses for which PEGC I OP would,
but for this _clause (i)_, be liable thereunder exceeds, on a cumulative
basis, an amount equal to the Deductible, in which event PEGC I OP shall be
liable for all such Losses in excess of the Deductible (subject to the other
limitations in this _clause (b)_ and this _Article X_ ); or

  



  

(ii) in excess of an amount equal to the Cap;

  



  

   

72 
--- 

 



    



  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Deductible nor the Cap shall apply
to any claims of, or causes of action arising out of, involving or
otherwise in respect of (i) any Fundamental Representation or (ii) Fraud.

  



  

Section 10.03 _Calculation of Losses_. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under _Article VIII_ or this _Article X _shall
be net of (i) any amounts recovered and actually received by the Indemnified
Party under any insurance policy with respect to such Loss, and (ii) any
amounts actually recovered from other third parties with respect to such Loss.
In the event any Indemnified Party is entitled to any insurance proceeds,
indemnity payments or any third-party recoveries in respect of any Losses for
which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Article VIII_ or this _Article X_ , such Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, receive or realize such proceeds,
payments or recoveries. In the event that any such insurance proceeds,
indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries are realized by an
Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt by such Indemnified Party of any
indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the claims to which such
insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries relate,
appropriate refunds shall be made promptly by the relevant Indemnified
Parties of all or the relevant portion of such indemnification payment, net of
costs incurred by such indemnified Party to obtain such insurance proceeds,
indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries.

  



  

Section 10.04 _PEGC Disclosure Committee_. (a) On the last day of each
quarter following the Closing Date, (b) on the date that is ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Termination Date and (c) on the date that is ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Statute of Limitations Termination Date, the
PEGC Disclosure Committee shall convene to discuss any potential
indemnification claims by any PEGC I Indemnitee under this _Article X_ or
_Section 8.01(a)_ and the senior management of PEGC I shall promptly (and in
any event within one (1) Business Day of each such meeting) inform the
Special Committee of any Losses reasonably determined by the PEGC
Disclosure Committee in good faith to have been suffered by a PEGC I
Indemnitee for which indemnification is available under this _Article X_ or
_Section 8.01(a)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the PEGC Disclosure Committee
shall continue to meet until no claims for indemnification may be made under
_Section 10.01(a)_ or _Section 8.01(a)(i)_ , _(ii)_ or _(iii)_.

Section 10.05 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements; Termination of Indemnification_. The representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained herein, in the Ancillary Agreements and in
any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto shall survive the
Closing as follows: (a) the Fundamental Representations shall survive until
the six (6) year anniversary of the Closing; (b) all other representations and
warranties shall survive through the Termination Date (except that the
representations and warranties relating to Taxes contained in _Section 3.15_
and _Section 3.25_ shall survive through the Statute of Limitations
Termination Date); (c) the covenants to be performed at or before the Closing
shall survive until one hundred thirty-five (135) days after the Closing;
and (d) all other covenants shall survive for one hundred thirty-five (135)

The rights of each PEGC I Indemnitee under _Section 10.01(a)_ , and the rights
of each Contributor Indemnitee under _Section 10.02(a)_ , after the Closing
shall not be affected by any knowledge at or before the execution hereof or
at or before the Closing of any breach of representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement, whether such knowledge came from any Contributor, PEGC I OP or
any other Person, or any waiver of condition set forth in _Article VII_. The
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless any party: (w) pursuant to
_Sections 8.01(a)(i)_ , (ii) or (iii) shall terminate on the Statute of
Limitations Termination Date; (x) pursuant to _Section 10.01(a)(i)_ or
_Section 10.02(a)(i)_ shall terminate when the applicable representation or
warranty terminates in accordance with this _Section 10.05_; (y) pursuant to
_Section 8.01(a)(iv)_ , _Section 8.01(d)_ , _Section 10.01(a)(ii)_ , _Section
10.01(a)(iii)_ or _Section 10.02(a)(ii)_ shall terminate when the applicable
covenant terminates in accordance with this _Section 10.05_; and (z)
pursuant to the other clauses of _Section 10.01(a)_ and _Section 10.02(a)_
shall terminate on the Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with
respect to any Losses as to which (1) the PEGC Disclosure Committee has
determined a claim may be made, but such claim has not been communicated to
the Special Committee pursuant to _Section 10.04_ , (2) the Indemnified Party
shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period, made a claim by
delivering a notice of such claim in accordance with _Section 10.06_ to the
Indemnifying Party specifying, the basis of the claim and, to the extent
practical, the Losses incurred prior to the expiration of the applicable
period or (3) to the extent arising out of a Third-Party Claim (including any
claim by any Governmental Entity), (x) such Losses were asserted in
writing prior to the expiration of the applicable period, (y) such claim is
made in respect of a reasonably estimated amount of Losses (if then known or
estimable) reasonably expected to arise in connection with such Third-Party
Claim and (z) such Third-Party Claim has been actually commenced or
threatened.

  



  

Section 10.06 _Procedures_.

  



  

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. In order for a Person (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided
for under _Section 10.01_ or _Section 10.02_ in respect of, arising out of
or involving a claim made by any Person not a party hereto against the
Indemnified Party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must,
within thirty (30) days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written
notice of the commencement of a Third-Party Claim or the threat of a Third-
Party Claim, notify the indemnifying party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in
writing of such actual or threatened Third-Party Claim (such notice, a "
_Third-Party Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to
timely give a Third-Party Claim Notice shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall
have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure or
(ii) the Indemnified Party fails to provide such Third-Party Claim Notice in
accordance with this _Section 10.06_ prior to the expiration of
the applicable period set forth in _Section 10.05_. For the avoidance of
doubt, in instances where PEGC I OP is the Indemnified Party, the
aforementioned thirty (30) day period shall not begin with respect to a
potential Third-Party Claim until such time as the Special Committee has been
informed of such Claim pursuant to _Section 10.04_.

  



  

   

74 
--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Assumption_. If a Third-Party Claim is made against an
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in
the defense thereof and (unless the Indemnifying Party fails to provide
reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Party of its willingness and
financial capacity to defend such Third-Party Claim), if it so chooses, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party by
providing the Indemnified Party with written notice of such election within
thirty (30) days after its receipt of the applicable Third-Party Claim
Notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that such counsel is not reasonably
objected to by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third-Party Claim in accordance with this _Section 10.06(b)_,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any
legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
with the defense thereof (which, for the sake of clarity, will not be Losses
indemnifiable under this _Article X_ ). Any such participation or assumption
shall not constitute a waiver by any party of any attorney-client privilege in
connection with such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third-Party Claim in accordance with this _Section
10.06(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the
Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. The Indemnifying Party shall
be liable (subject to _Section 10.06_ below) for the fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third-Party Claim, all
the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party
Claim, and making employees available at such times and places as may be
reasonably necessary to defend against such Third-Party Claim for the purpose
of providing additional information, explanation or testimony in connection
with such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of
a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not agree to the entry of
any Judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to such
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless such
settlement: (xx) does not involve any finding or admission of any violation of
Law; (yy) does not involve any relief other than monetary damages that are
satisfied in full out of the Escrowed Consideration in the Escrow Account (in
accordance with _Section 10.08_ below); and (zz) completely, finally and
unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party in connection with such Third-
Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not
be entitled to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim (and shall be
liable for the fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party
in defending such Third-Party Claim) if: (yyy) the Third-Party Claim seeks an
injunction or other equitable relief or relief other than monetary damages
for which the Indemnified Party could be entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement; or (zzz) the Third-Party Claim is a criminal Proceeding, or
relates to such a Proceeding, or the underlying facts or circumstances of
which would reasonably be expected to give rise to such a Proceeding. If the
Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall not agree to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement or compromise with respect to such Third-Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

  



  

(c) Regardless of whether the defense of a Third-Party Claim is
controlled by the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, the
controlling party shall not, without the prior written consent of the non-
controlling party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) cause, or agree to, the waiver of the
attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product immunity or any other
privilege or protection in respect of confidential legal memoranda and other
privileged materials drafted by, or otherwise reflecting the legal advice of,
internal or outside counsel of an Indemnified Party (the " _Subject Materials_
") relating to such Third-Party Claim. Each party hereto mutually
acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that (i)
each shares a common legal interest in preparing for the defense of legal
proceedings, or potential legal proceedings, arising out of, relating to or
in respect of any actual or threatened Third-Party Claim or any related claim
or counterclaim, (ii) the sharing of Subject Materials will further
such common legal interest, and (iii) by disclosing any Subject Materials to
and/or sharing any Subject Materials with the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall not waive the attorney-client privilege, attorney
work-product immunity or any other privilege or protection. The Indemnified
Party shall not be required to make available to the Indemnifying Party any
information that is subject to an attorney-client or other applicable legal
privilege that based on the advice of outside counsel would be impaired by
such disclosure or any confidentiality restriction under applicable Law.

  



  

   

75 
--- 

 



    



  

(d) _Direct Claims_. In the event any Indemnified Party has a
claim against any Indemnifying Party under _Section 10.01_ or _Section
10.02_ that does not involve a Third-Party Claim (such claim, a " _Direct
Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such Direct Claim to
the Indemnifying Party (such notice, a " _Direct Claim Notice_ "); _provided_
,  _however_ , that failure to timely give a Direct Claim Notice shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent that (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure or (ii) the Indemnified Party fails to provide such
Direct Claim Notice in accordance with this _Section 10.06_ prior to
the expiration of the applicable period set forth in _Section 10.05_. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)
days following its receipt of such Direct Claim Notice that the Indemnifying
Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under _Section 10.01(a)_
or _Section 10.02(a)_ , such Direct Claim shall be conclusively deemed a Loss
indemnifiable under this Agreement (subject to the limitations in this
_Article X_ ).

  



  

(e) At any time after delivery of a Direct Claim Notice, at the
reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party
shall grant the Indemnifying Party and its representatives all reasonable
access to the books, records, employees and properties of such Indemnified
Party to the extent reasonably related to the matters to which the applicable
Direct Claim relates; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no Indemnified Party
shall be obligated to grant access to, disclose or otherwise provide any
information the disclosure of which, in the reasonable judgment of the
Indemnified Party is subject to attorney-client privilege or attorney-
work product doctrine that would be waived if provided to the Indemnifying
Party in the manner requested ( _provided_ , that if information is withheld
pursuant to this proviso the Indemnified Party shall provide a list or other
reasonable description to the Indemnifying Party of the information withheld
without any requirement to disclose or include any privileged material in any
such list or description). All such access shall be granted during normal
business hours and shall be granted under the conditions which shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of such Indemnified
Party.

  



  

(f) _Coordination with Tax Contests_. If there shall be any
conflicts between the provisions of this _Section 10.06_ and _Article VIII_
, the provisions of _Article VIII_ shall control with respect to Tax contests.

  



  

Section 10.07 _Mitigation of Losses_. An Indemnified Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to mitigate any Losses for which it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Article VIII_ and this _Article X_. The
Indemnifying Party(ies) shall have the right, but not the obligation, and
shall be afforded the opportunity by the Indemnified Party to the extent
reasonably possible, to take all available steps to minimize Losses for which
the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification before such Losses
actually are incurred by the Indemnified Party.

Section 10.08 _Claims Against the Escrow Account; Payment of Defense Costs
and Settlements_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 10.01(b)(ii)_ and _Section 8.01(a)_ , the
first (but not the sole) source of recovery for all Claims for Losses by PEGC
I Indemnitees under _Article VIII_ and this _Article X_ shall be the Escrowed
Consideration in the Escrow Account;  _provided_ , that in no event shall the
Contributors have any liability under _Section 10.01(a)(i)_ (other than with
respect to claims of, or causes of action arising out of, involving or
otherwise in respect of any Fundamental Representation or Fraud) in excess of
the Cap. PEGC I OP shall have the right to notify the Escrow Agent of any
claim for indemnification made by any PEGC I Indemnitee pursuant to _Article
VIII_ or this _Article X_. Promptly following the final determination of any
claim for indemnification made by any PEGC I Indemnitee pursuant to _Article
VIII_ or this _Article X_ , upon request by PEGC I OP, the Contributors'
Representative shall execute and deliver a certificate requesting the Escrow
Agent to deliver to PEGC I OP the number of OP Units (not to exceed the number
of OP Units in the Escrow Account) equal to the amount of such claim as
finally determined in accordance with _Article VIII_ or this _Article X_
divided by the Implied Valuation (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

  



  

(b) If the Contributors' Representative or any Contributor assumes
the defense of any Third-Party Claim for which the PEGC I Indemnitees have or
may seek indemnification under this _Article X_ , reasonable expenses incurred
by the Contributors' Representative or any Contributor in connection
therewith, including reasonable legal costs and expenses, shall be paid to the
Contributors' Representative or such Contributor(s), as applicable, in cash
by PEGC I OP from time to time upon request. Concurrently with such payment,
PEGC I OP and the Contributors' Representative shall execute and deliver a
certificate requesting the Escrow Agent to deliver to PEGC I OP the number of
OP Units (not to exceed the number of OP Units in the Escrow Account) equal
to the amount of such payment divided by the Implied Valuation (rounded up to
the nearest whole number).

  



  

(c) If one or more of the Contributors is an Indemnifying Party in
connection with a Third-Party Claim, any obligation to pay
settlements, penalties, fines or other similar amounts to the applicable
third party(ies) shall be made or satisfied in cash by PEGC I OP.
Concurrently with such payment, PEGC I OP and the Contributors'
Representative shall execute and deliver a certificate requesting the Escrow
Agent to deliver to PEGC I OP the number of OP Units (not to exceed the number
of OP Units in the Escrow Account) equal to the amount of such payment
divided by the Implied Valuation (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

Section 10.09 _Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Except with
respect to Fraud, Willful Misconduct and for claims for specific performance
of covenants and agreements, and subject to _Section 10.12_ hereof, following
the Closing, indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the parties and any parties claiming by or through
any party (including the Indemnified Parties) related to or arising from any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in,
or otherwise pursuant to, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and
none of PEGC I, PEGC OP, the Contributors, any Contributed Company or the
Contributors' Representative (or, for the sake of clarity, any of their
respective partners, members, shareholders, control Persons or employees)
shall have any other rights or remedies in connection with any breach of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or any other liability arising out of the
negotiation, entry into or consummation of the Transactions, whether based on
contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise.
All representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements are contractual in nature only and subject to the sole
and exclusive remedies set forth in this _Article X_. Furthermore, each of
PEGC I, PEGC OP, the Contributors and the Contributors' Representative
acknowledge and agree that:

  



  

(i) the parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights,
liabilities and obligations respecting the Transactions exclusively
in contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement
and, except for Fraud, hereby waive any statutory and common law remedies,
including remedies that may be available under Environmental Laws, with
respect to matters relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including with respect to any environmental, health or safety
matters);

  



  

(ii) the sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and/or the Ancillary Agreements (including any
representations and warranties set forth herein, made in connection herewith
or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), or any Action otherwise
arising out of or related to the Transactions, shall be those remedies
available at law or in equity for breach of contract only (as such
contractual remedies have been further limited or excluded pursuant to the
express terms of this Agreement, and excepting Fraud); and

  



  

(iii) the parties each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement
embodies the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived
from arm's-length negotiations, and the parties specifically acknowledge that
no party has any special relationship with another party that would justify
any expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an
arm's-length transaction.

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made to the Closing Consideration
pursuant to _Section 1.05_ shall not be considered "remedies" for purposes of
this _Section 10.09_ and shall not be limited by the terms of this _Section
10.09_.

  



  

Section 10.10 _Tax Treatment_. All amounts paid or settled in OP Units with
respect to Losses under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties hereto
for all federal and applicable state income Tax purposes as adjustments to the
total consideration payable for the Contributions unless otherwise required
by Law.

Section 10.11 _Release_. Effective as of, and expressly conditioned upon, the
Closing, each Contributor, on behalf of such Contributor and each of
such Contributor's Subsidiaries, general partners, managing members and its
and their respective Related Persons (collectively, the " _Releasors_ "),
releases and forever discharges PEGC I, PEGC I OP, each Contributed Company
and each Subsidiary thereof, and each of their respective individual, joint
or mutual, past, present and future Representatives, successors and assigns
(individually, a " _Releasee_ " and collectively, " _Releasees_ "), from any
and all claims, demands, Proceedings, causes of action and Judgments that
such Releasor now has, has ever had or may hereafter have against the
respective Releasees, in each case of any nature (whether absolute or
contingent, asserted or unasserted, known or unknown, primary or secondary,
direct or indirect, and whether or not accrued), arising contemporaneously
with or before the Closing Date or on account of or arising out of any
matter, cause or event occurring contemporaneously with or before the Closing
Date (collectively, the " _Released Claims_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the term "Released Claims" shall not include claims brought by
Releasors with respect to (a) the obligations or PEGC I, PEGC I OP or their
respective Subsidiaries under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, (b)
any claim related to employment with PEGC I, PEGC I OP, the Contributors, the
Contributed Companies or any of their Subsidiaries or (c) any rights to
indemnification or reimbursement from any Contributed Company or
Subsidiary thereof, whether pursuant to their respective certificate of
incorporation or by-laws (or comparable documents), Contract or otherwise and
whether or not relating to claims pending on, or asserted after, the Closing
Date. Each Contributor, on behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries and
executive officers, hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or
indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or
causing to be commenced, any Proceeding of any kind against any Releasee,
based upon any Released Claim.

  



  

Section 10.12 _Title Claims_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
from and after the Closing and the issuance of the Title Policies
herein described, to the extent that the substance of the Real Estate Title
Representations are also covered by one or more of the Title Policies, PEGC I
OP agrees that it will not unreasonably curtail the senior management team of
PEGC I OP from pursuing any claim with respect to a breach or violation of
such Real Estate Title Representations first against the Title Company. To the
extent any claim against the Title Company fails to reasonably compensate
PEGC I OP for any loss, cost or damage as a result of the matter giving rise
to the breach or violation of such Real Estate Title Representation (including
a denial of any claim made on a Title Policy (in whole or in part)), then
PEGC I OP shall have the right to pursue any deficiency in accordance with the
terms and provisions hereof as a result of the breach or violation of such
representation or warranty. In no event shall any recovery under the
Title Policies reduce or otherwise affect either the Cap or Deductible
described herein. Furthermore, in the event that PEGC 1 OP makes a claim
against a Title Policy (a " _Subject Title Claim_ ") with respect to any
matter that is covered by a Real Estate Title Representation, and such
Subject Title Claim is made prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period for such representation and warranty as provided for herein (" _RE
Title Survival Period_ "), then PEGC 1 OP shall have the right to deliver
written notice of such Subject Title Claim to the Contributors' Representative
(a " _Subject Title Claim Notice_ "). In the event that PEGC 1 OP delivers a
Subject Title Claim Notice to Contributors' Representative, and the Subject
Title Claim described therein is thereafter denied (in whole or in part) by
the Title Company which issued the Title Policy under which such Subject
Title Claim was made, then the RE Title Survival Period of the Real
Estate Title Representation which is covered by such Subject Title Claim
shall be deemed to have automatically been extended with respect to such
Subject Title Claim by a number of days equal to the number of days falling
within the period that commences on the date on which the Subject Title Claim
Notice was delivered to the Contributors' Representative and ends on the date
on which written notice of the Title Company's denial (in whole or in part)
of the Subject Title Claim was delivered to PEGC 1 OP. For clarity, the terms
and provisions of this _Section 10.12_ shall in no way limit or impair the
rights of PEGC I OP under the terms and provisions of _Section 7.02_ hereof.

hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by any party (including by

OP's sale, disposition or other transfer, in whole or in part, of the shares
of capital stock or other equity interests in, or business or assets or
properties of, any Contributed Company or Subsidiary thereof, the Contributors
hereby agree that PEGC I OP may assign, in whole or in part, any

Section 11.11 _Dispute Resolution_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
1.05_ and _Section 1.06_ , any Covered Claim, including the determination of
the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be finally
resolved by binding arbitration in New York, New York under JAMS
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures as those rules exist on the
effective date of this Agreement (the " _Rules_ ") and in accordance with the
Expedited Procedures set forth in those Rules, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2
of those Rules, except as modified by this Agreement. Each party hereto hereby
waives any right it may otherwise have to resolution of any Covered Claim by
any means other than arbitration pursuant to this _Section 11.11_. As a
minimum set of rules in the arbitration, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

(a) The arbitration will be held before a panel of three (3)
arbitrators. Within fifteen (15) days after the commencement of
arbitration, each party shall select one person to act as arbitrator, and the
two so selected shall select a third arbitrator within thirty (30) days of
the commencement of the arbitration. If the arbitrators selected by the
parties are unable or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator within the
allotted time, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by JAMS in accordance
with the Rules. All arbitrators serve as neutral, independent and impartial
arbitrators, and each party shall communicate its choice of a party-appointed
arbitrator only to the JAMS Case Manager in charge of the filing. Neither
party is to inform any of the arbitrators as to which of the parties may have
appointed them.

  



  

(b) The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the
arbitration proceeding and the award, including the hearing, except as may be
necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a
judicial challenge to an Award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise
required by any Law or Judgment.

  



  

(c) In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement,
the arbitrators are not empowered to award punitive or exemplary
damages, except where permitted by statute, and the parties waive any right
to recover any such damages.

  



  

(d) In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement,
the arbitrators shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and
attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with
the arbitration. If the arbitrators determine a party to be the prevailing
party under circumstances where the prevailing party won on some but not all
of the claims and counterclaims, the arbitrators may award the prevailing
party an appropriate percentage of the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably
incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration.

Section 11.12 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against,
and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought
against, the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then
only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with
respect to such party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement
(and then only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such
named party in this Agreement and not otherwise), no past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of
the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) for any one or more of the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any one or more
of each Contributor, Contributed Company, the Contributors' Representative,
PEGC I or PEGC I OP under this Agreement (whether for indemnification or
otherwise) or of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 11.13 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representations_.

  



  

(a) PEGC I and PEGC I OP acknowledge that Latham and Watkins LLP and
other legal counsel (" _Prior Counsel_ ") have, on or prior to the Closing
Date, represented one or more of the Contributors, Contributed Companies, and
the Contributors' Representative and their respective Subsidiaries and other
Affiliates, and their respective officers, employees and directors in one or
more matters relating to this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby (including any matter that may be related to
a litigation, claim or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement or
such other agreements or in connection with such transactions) (each, an "
_Existing Representation_ "), and that, in the event of any post-Closing
matters (x) relating to this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby (including any matter that may be related to
a litigation, claim or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement or
such other agreements or in connection with such transactions) and (y) in
which PEGC I or PEGC I OP or any of their respective Affiliates (including the
Contributed Companies and their respective Subsidiaries), on the one hand,
and one or more Contributor or the Contributors' Representative, on the other
hand, are or may be adverse to each other (each, a " _Post-Closing Matter_
"), that each Contributor and the Contributors' Representative reasonably
anticipate that Prior Counsel will represent them in connection with such
matters. Accordingly, each of PEGC I, PEGC I OP and the Contributed Companies
hereby (i) waives and shall not assert, and agrees after the Closing to
cause its Affiliates to waive and to not assert, any conflict of interest
arising out of or relating to the representation by one or more Prior Counsel
of one or more Contributor or the Contributors' Representative in connection
with one or more Post-Closing Matters (the " _Post-Closing Representations_
") _,_ and (ii) agrees that, in the event that a Post-Closing Matter arises,
Prior Counsel may represent one or more Contributor or the Contributors'
Representative in a Post-Closing Matter even though the interests of such
Person(s) may be directly adverse to PEGC I, PEGC I OP, any of the Contributed
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, and even though Prior
Counsel may (i) have represented any of the Contributed Companies or their
respective Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute or
(ii) be currently representing any of the Contributors or the Contributors'
Representative or any of their respective Affiliates. Without limiting the
foregoing, each of PEGC I, PEGC I OP and the Contributed Companies (on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates) consents to the disclosure by Prior Counsel, in
connection with one or more Post-Closing Representations, to the Contributors
or Contributors' Representative of any information learned by Prior Counsel
in the course of one or more Existing Representations, whether or not such
information is subject to the attorney-client privilege of the Contributed
Companies or any of their Subsidiaries and/or Prior Counsel's duty of
confidentiality as to the Contributed Companies or any of their Subsidiaries
and whether or not such disclosure is made before or after the Closing.

--- 

 



    



  

(b) Each of PEGC I and PEGC I OP, and the Contributors'
Representative (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) waives and shall
not assert, and agrees after the Closing to cause its Affiliates to waive and
to not assert, any attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product
protection or expectation of client confidence with respect to any
communication between Prior Counsel, on the one hand, and any Contributed
Company, on the other hand, or any advice given to any Contributed Company by
Prior Counsel, occurring during one or more Existing Representations (the "
_Pre-Closing Privileges_ ") in connection with any Post-
Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute between any
Contributed Company and one or more of the Contributors or the Contributors'
Representative and their respective Affiliates. Furthermore, each of PEGC I
and PEGC I OP, and the Contributors' Representative (on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates) acknowledges and agrees that with respect to any Post-Closing
Matters, any advice given to or communication with any of the Contributed
Companies shall not be subject to any joint privilege (whether or not the
Contributors' Representative or one more of its Subsidiaries also received
such advice or communication) and shall be owned solely by such Contributed
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises
between PEGC I or PEGC I OP, or the Contributors' Representative or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a third party other than
a Contributed Company, on the other hand, the Contributors' Representative
shall (and shall cause his Affiliates to) assert the Pre-Closing Privileges
on behalf of the Contributed Companies to prevent disclosure of Privileged
Materials to such third party.

  



  

(c) All such Pre-Closing Privileges, and the portion of any books
and records and other documents of the Contributors'
Representative containing any advice or communication that is subject to any
Pre-Closing Privilege (" _Privileged Materials_ "), shall be distributed to
the applicable Contributed Company immediately prior to the Closing with (in
the case of such books and records) no copies retained by the Contributors'
Representative.

  



  

(d) PEGC I and PEGC I OP hereby acknowledge that each has had the
opportunity (including on behalf of its Affiliates) to discuss and
obtain adequate information concerning the significance and material risks
of, and reasonable available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and
other provisions of this Agreement, including the opportunity to consult with
counsel other than Prior Counsel. This _Section 11.13_ shall be irrevocable,
and no term of this _Section 11.13_ may be amended, waived or modified,
without the prior written consent of the PEGC I, PEGC I OP and the
Contributors' Representative and Prior Counsel affected thereby.

Representative have duly executed this Agreement under seal as of the date
first written above.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements
contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as

control with such Person. For the purposes of this definition, "control" when
used with respect to any Person means the possession, directly or indirectly,
of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies
of such Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by
contract or otherwise, and the terms "controlling" and "controlled" have
meanings correlative to the foregoing.

approval).

  



  

Section 1.6 " _Approved Liability_ " means:

requirements are satisfied:

  



  

(i) the liability is secured by real property or other assets (the "
_Collateral_ ") owned directly by the Operating Partnership or by an entity
whose separate existence from the Operating Partnership is disregarded for
U.S. federal income tax purposes;

  



  

(ii) on the date on which the Operating Partnership designated such
liability as an Approved Liability, the outstanding principal amount (and any
accrued and unpaid interest) of the liability and any other Approved
Liabilities secured by such Collateral at such time was no more than 65% of
the fair market value (as reasonably determined in good faith by the Operating
Partnership) of the Collateral at such time, _provided_ that if interest on
such liability is "pay in kind" or otherwise not required to be paid (in
cash) at least annually or if the documents evidencing such liability permit
the borrower to borrow additional amounts that are secured by the Collateral,
the outstanding principal amount of such liability shall include the maximum
amount that could be so added to the principal amount of such liability
without a default;

  



  

(iii) no other Person has executed any guarantees with respect to such
liability other than: (A) guarantees by the Protected Partners; (B)
guarantees by Affiliates of the Operating Partnership, provided that each
applicable Protected Partner indemnifies each such Affiliate against any
liability of such Affiliate (to the extent such liability does not exceed such
Protected Partner's Required Liability Amount) arising solely from the
existence or performance of such guarantee; and (C) non-recourse carve
out guarantees (i.e., bad-boy guarantees);

  



  

(iv) the Collateral does not provide security for another liability
(other than another Approved Liability) that ranks senior to, or _pari passu_
with, the liability described in clause (i) above; and

  



  

(v) the liability is a Guarantee Permissible Liability.

  



  

For purposes of determining whether clause (ii) has been satisfied in
situations where one or more potential Approved Liabilities are secured by
more than one item of Collateral, the Operating Partnership shall allocate
such liabilities among such items of Collateral in proportion to their
relative fair market values (as reasonably determined in good faith by the
Operating Partnership); or

  



  

   

2

such agreement.

  



  

Section 1.11 " _Contribution Transactions_ " means the acquisition of a
portfolio of properties pursuant to the Contribution Agreement.

such liability shall be refinanced, otherwise repaid, or guaranteed by any of
the REIT, the Operating Partnership, or one or more of their Affiliates, or
guaranteed by one or more partners of the Operating Partnership, or (b) that
would otherwise result in any reduction in the amount of Nonrecourse
Liabilities or Approved Liabilities allocated to a Protected Partner; in each
case other than fixed scheduled payments of principal occurring prior to the
maturity date of such liability.

Transfer, _the sum of_ (i) _the product of_ (A) the amount of income or gain
recognized by such Protected Partner under Section 704(c) of the Code in
respect of such Tax Protection Period Transfer (taking into account any
adjustments under Section 743 of the Code to which such Protected Partner is
entitled) _multiplied by_ (B) the Make Whole Tax Rate, _plus _ (ii) an amount
equal to the combined U.S. federal and applicable state income taxes
(calculated using the Make Whole Tax Rate) imposed on such Protected Partner
as a result of the receipt by such Protected Partner of a payment under
_Section 2.2_ (the " _Gross Up Amount_ ");

  



  

(b) with respect to any Protected Partner that recognizes income or
gain as a result of a breach by the Operating Partnership of the
provisions of _Section 2.4_ hereof, _the sum of_ (i) _the product of_ (A) the
amount of income or gain recognized by such Protected Partner by reason of
such breach, _multiplied by_ (B) the Make Whole Tax Rate, _plus_ (ii) an
amount equal to the combined U.S. federal and applicable state income taxes
(calculated using the Make Whole Tax Rate) imposed on such Protected Partner
as a result of the receipt by such Protected Partner of a payment under
_Section 2.4_ (the " _Debt Gross Up Amount_ "); and

  



  

(c) with respect to any Protected Partner that recognizes income or
gain as a result of a Fundamental Transaction described in clause (ii) of
_Section 2.1(a)_ or as a result of the receipt of consideration payable
pursuant to _Section 3.5_ , _the sum of _ (i) _the product of_ (A) the amount
of income or gain recognized by such Protected Partner in respect of such
transaction,  _multiplied by_ (B) the Make Whole Tax Rate, _plus_ (ii) an
amount equal to the combined U.S. federal and applicable state income taxes
(calculated using the Make Whole Tax Rate) imposed on such Protected Partner

Transaction Gross Up Amount_ ").

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, each Make Whole Amount shall be calculated
pursuant to the formula set forth above, and the actual taxes or tax
attributes of the Protected Partners shall not be taken into account. For
purposes of calculating the amount of Section 704(c) gain that is allocated
to a Protected Partner, (i) subject to clause (ii) below, any "reverse
Section 704(c) gain" allocated to such Protected Partner pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-3(a)(6) shall not be taken into account, _provided_
, _however_ , that (ii) if, as a result of adjustments to the Gross Asset
Value (as defined in the OP Agreement) of the Protected Properties pursuant
to clause (b) of the definition of Gross Asset Value as set forth in the OP
Agreement, all or a portion of the gain recognized by the Operating
Partnership that would have been Section 704(c) gain without regard to such
adjustments becomes or is treated as "reverse Section 704(c) gain" or
Section 704(b) gain under Section 704 of the Code, then such gain shall
continue to be treated as Section 704(c) gain.

any Tax Protection Period Transfer of a Protected Property (including any
interest therein or in the entity owning, directly or indirectly, the

Partner, then the Operating Partnership shall pay such excess to such
Protected Partner within ten (10) business days after the date of such
determination, and if such estimated Make Whole Amount exceeds the true Make
Whole Amount, then such Protected Partner shall pay such excess to the

such Protected Partner.

Period Transfer or Fundamental Transaction by a Protected Partner or the
Partners' Representative in its capacity as, or acting for, an owner of OP
Units or shares of the REIT shall not constitute a waiver of such Protected
Partner's right to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ as a
result of such Tax Protection Period Transfer or Fundamental Transaction.

  



  

Section 2.3 _Section 704(c) Methodology_. The Operating Partnership
shall use the traditional method (without curative allocations) as set forth
in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(b) with respect to the Protected
Properties. A good faith estimate of the initial amount of Section 704(c) gain
allocable to each Protected Property as of the Closing Date of the
Contribution Transactions is set forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto. The parties
acknowledge that the initial amount of such Section 704(c) gain may be
adjusted over time, including as required by Section 704(c) of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

Section 2.4 _Nonrecourse Liability Maintenance and Debt Guarantee_.

  



  

(a) During the Tax Protection Period, the Operating Partnership shall:
(i) use its commercially reasonable best efforts to maintain on a continuous
basis an amount of Nonrecourse Liabilities that would be allocated to each
Protected Partner under Treasury Regulations Section 1.752-3 and for purposes
of Section 465(b)(6) of the Code at least equal to the Required Liability
Amount with respect to such Protected Partner; (ii) allocate excess
nonrecourse liabilities (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.752-3(a)(3)) in a manner that results in the greatest amount of excess
nonrecourse liabilities being allocated to the Protected Partners; and (iii)
provide the Partners' Representative, promptly upon request, with a
description of the nature and amount of any Approved Liabilities that are
available to be guaranteed by the Protected Partners pursuant to _Section
2.4(b)_ of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) During the Tax Protection Period, in the event that the amount of
Nonrecourse Liabilities allocated to any Protected Partner is, or is expected
to be, less than the Required Liability Amount with respect to such Protected
Partner (such shortfall, an " _Allocation Shortfall_ "), the Operating
Partnership shall provide such Protected Partner with (i) written notice of
such Allocation Shortfall, which notice shall be provided no later than
thirty (30) days prior to the occurrence of such Allocation Shortfall, and
(ii) the opportunity to execute an enforceable guarantee (a " _Guarantee_ ")
on a form provided by the Partners' Representative and approved by the
Operating Partnership (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), of
one or more Approved Liabilities in an amount up to such Allocation Shortfall
(each such opportunity, a " _Guarantee Opportunity_ "). The Guarantee
provided by any Protected Partner shall not be subordinated (i.e., have
relatively higher economic risk) to any other guarantees of the same debt
covered by such Protected Partner's Guarantee. The Operating Partnership shall
have the discretion to identify the Approved Liability or Approved
Liabilities that shall be made available for guarantee by each
Protected Partner. Each Protected Partner that is a Pass Through Entity and
its indirect owners may allocate the Guarantee Opportunity afforded to such
Protected Partner in any manner they choose. The Operating Partnership agrees
to file its tax returns allocating any debt subject to a Guarantee to the
applicable Protected Partners without disclosure (relating to the avoidance of
penalties), except to the extent that the Operating Partnership is required
to do otherwise as a result of (i) a final determination to the
contrary within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or comparable
applicable state law) or (ii) a change in applicable tax law after the date
this Agreement is executed. Each Protected Partner shall bear the costs
incurred by it in connection with the execution of any Guarantee to which it
is a party. To the extent a Protected Partner executes a Guarantee, the
Operating Partnership shall deliver a copy of such Guarantee to the
applicable lender promptly after receiving such copy from the relevant
Protected Partner.

  



  

(c) During the Tax Protection Period, the Operating Partnership shall
not allow a Debt Notification Event to occur unless the Operating
Partnership provides at least thirty (30) days' written notice (a " _Section
2.4 Notice_ ") to each Protected Partner that may be affected thereby. The
Section 2.4 Notice shall describe the Debt Notification Event and designate
one or more Approved Liabilities that may be guaranteed by the Protected
Partners pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ of this Agreement. The Section 2.4
Notice shall be deemed to have been provided when delivered to the Protected
Partner in accordance with Section 15.2 of the OP Agreement. Any Protected
Partner that desires to execute a Guarantee following the receipt of a Section
2.4 Notice shall provide the Operating Partnership with notice thereof within
ten (10) days after the date of the Section 2.4 Notice.

(d) If the Operating Partnership fails to comply with any provision of
this _Section 2.4_ (and the Operating Partnership does not receive the
Approval of the Partners' Representative with respect to such failure), the
Operating Partnership shall pay an amount of cash equal to the estimated Make
Whole Amount to each Protected Partner no later than the thirteenth
(13th) day after the end of the quarter in which in which such failure took
place. If it is later determined that the true Make Whole Amount applicable
to a Protected Partner exceeds the estimated Make Whole Amount applicable to
such Protected Partner, then the Operating Partnership shall pay such excess
to such Protected Partner within ten (10) business days after the date of such
determination, and if such estimated Make Whole Amount exceeds the true Make
Whole Amount, then such Protected Partner shall pay such excess to the
Operating Partnership within ten (10) business days after the date of such
determination, but only to the extent such excess was actually received by
such Protected Partner.

market value of such partnership's assets; provided, further, that no
distribution may be made by such partnership with respect to such subordinate
units of partnership interest to the extent the requirement described in

leverage limitation described in clause (x) would not be met immediately
after such distribution; and

consummation of the relevant Fundamental Transaction or (y) the expiration of
the Tax Protection Period, the holder must have a put right to the acquiror
partnership for cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of such
common units at the time of the exercise of the put right (without liquidity
discount or minority interest discount); provided, however, that the exercise
of such put right during the Tax Protection Period will not trigger the
payment of any Make Whole Amount pursuant to _Section 2.2_ or  _Section 3.5_
, unless the acquiror partnership is in breach of the covenants set forth in
clause (C) above, the Partners' Representative provides to the acquiror
partnership written notice of such breach, and such breach has not been cured
within ten (10) days of the date of such notice; provided, further, that
after the expiration of the Tax Protection Period, the exercise of such put
right will not trigger any payment of any Make Whole Amount pursuant to
_Section 2.2_ or _Section 3.5_ ; and

  



  

(iii) preferred units in an acquiror partnership that initially acquires
all or substantially all of the assets of the Operating Partnership with the

maintain at all times subordinate or common units with a value equal to at
least 100% of the value of the OP Units exchanged for preferred units; (y) not

with respect to subordinate or common partnership interests to the extent the
leverage limitation described in clause (y) would not be met immediately
after such distribution; and

  



  

(D) until the second anniversary of the expiration of the Tax
Protection Period, upon the earlier of (x) the fifth anniversary of the
consummation of the relevant Fundamental Transaction or (y) the expiration of
the Tax Protection Period, the holder must have a put right to the acquiror
partnership for cash in an amount equal to the liquidation preference of such
preferred units plus any accrued and unpaid distributions; provided, however,
that the exercise of such put right during the Tax Protection Period will not
trigger the payment of any Make Whole Amount pursuant to _Section 2.2_ or
_Section 3.5_ , unless the acquiror partnership is in breach of the covenants
set forth in clause (C) above, the Partners' Representative provides to the
acquiror partnership written notice of such breach, and such breach has not
been cured within ten (10) days of the date of such notice; provided,
further, that after the expiration of the Tax Protection Period, the exercise
of such put right will not trigger any payment of any Make Whole Amount
pursuant to _Section 2.2_ or _Section 3.5_.

  



  

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, subject to compliance with the ongoing

consideration choices described in _Section 3.3(a)_ are offered to the
Protected Partners and, in the case of clauses (a)(ii) and (a)(iii) above, as
applicable, in a transaction that is not a Gain Transaction, and the leverage
and distribution limitations described in _Section 3.3(a)_ are complied with,
the Operating Partnership shall not be required to pay any Make Whole Amount
pursuant to _Section 2.2_ or _Section 3.5_ , and no consent of OP Unit
holders shall be required for the consummation of the Fundamental Transaction
other than the consent described in Article 11 of the OP Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Continuation of Protections_. If a Protected Partner
elects to receive the units described in _Section 3.1(a)(ii)_ , _Section
3.2(a)(ii)_ , _Section 3.3(a)(ii)_ or _Section 3.3(a)(iii) _ with respect to
a Fundamental Transaction, such Protected Holder shall be entitled to the
continuation of the protections set forth in this Agreement with respect to
the equity interests received in the acquiror partnership, including with
respect to the covenants set forth in _ARTICLE II_ and this _ARTICLE III_.
Any successor to the Operating Partnership must expressly assume the
obligations of the Operating Partnership under this _ARTICLE III_ as a
condition to becoming a successor to the Operating Partnership.

  



  

Section 3.5 _Indemnification_. During the Tax Protection Period, if a
Protected Partner elects to receive the units described in _Section
3.1(a)(ii)_ , _Section 3.2(a)(ii)_ , _Section 3.3(a)(ii)_  or _Section
3.3(a)(iii)_ with respect to a Fundamental Transaction and thereafter the
REIT, the Operating Partnership or their successors fail to comply with their
equity, leverage or distribution obligations set forth in this _ARTICLE III_
(after taking into account applicable cure periods set forth in this _ARTICLE
III_ ) (and the Operating Partnership does not receive the Approval of the
Partners' Representative with respect to such failure), then to the extent any
Protected Partner elects to, or is required to, receive the consideration
payable with respect to the redemption, exchange or other liquidity rights
relating to such units, the Operating Partnership shall pay, within ten (10)
business days after the expiration of the applicable cure periods, to each
Protected Partner an amount of cash equal to the estimated Make Whole Amount
applicable to such transaction. If it is later determined that the true Make
Whole Amount applicable to a Protected Partner exceeds the estimated Make
Whole Amount applicable to such Protected Partner, then the Operating
Partnership shall pay such excess to such Protected Partner within ten (10)
business days after the date of such determination, and if such estimated Make
Whole Amount exceeds the true Make Whole Amount, then such Protected Partner
shall pay such excess to the Operating Partnership within ten (10) business
days after the date of such determination, but only to the extent such excess
was actually received by such Protected Partner. For the avoidance of
doubt, a vote in favor of a Fundamental Transaction by a Protected Partner or
the Partners' Representative in its capacity as, or acting for, an owner of
OP Units or shares of the REIT shall not constitute a waiver of such Protected
Partner's right to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 3.5_ as a result
of such Fundamental Transaction.

Section 4.1 _Changes in Law; Voluntary Redemptions_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
the Operating Partnership shall not be required to make an indemnification
payment to a Protected Partner pursuant to this Agreement if such obligation
arises solely as a result of a change in any provision of the Code, the
Treasury Regulations or any other applicable tax law or any administrative or
judicial interpretation thereof (and not, for example, as a result of any Tax
Protection Period Transfer or Fundamental Transaction, or any change with
respect to Operating Partnership liabilities allocated to any Protected
Partner if such change is attributable to any act or omission by the
Operating Partnership).

  



  

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, a Protected Partner shall not be
entitled to the protections set forth in _ARTICLE II_ and _ARTICLE III_ in
the event of a full or partial redemption of the Protected Partner's interest
in the Operating Partnership pursuant to Section 15.1 of the OP Agreement;
provided, however, that the foregoing limitation in this _Section 4.1(b)_
shall not apply to such Protected Partner, and such Protected Partner shall
be entitled to any Make Whole Amount payable to such Protected Partner in an
amount determined under _Section 3.5_ , in the event the REIT or the Operating
Partnership engages in a Fundamental Transaction described in _Section
3.1(a)_ , _Section 3.2(a)_ or _Section 3.3(a)_ and either a Protected
Partner is not offered the consideration described in such provisions, as
applicable, or one or more compliance failures described in  _Section 3.5_
occurs.

  



  

Section 4.2 _Cooperation_. The Operating Partnership and the
Partners' Representative agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the

the Treasury Regulations or any other applicable tax law or any administrative
or judicial interpretation thereof would result in the recognition of taxable
income or gain by any Protected Partner, the parties shall reasonably
cooperate to minimize or avoid any resulting tax on such Protected Partner.
Prior to any anticipated change (or as soon as reasonably possible following
any unanticipated change) in any applicable provision of the Code, the
Treasury Regulations or any other applicable tax law or any administrative or
judicial interpretation thereof, or the consummation of any spin-off
transaction, reorganization transaction or other transaction that would
affect the Operating Partnership and the Protected Partners, the parties shall
cooperate in good faith to amend this Agreement as may be necessary or
appropriate to preserve the intent and effect of this Agreement.

all documents, provide all information and take or refrain from taking action
as may be necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this Agreement.

Section 4.10 _Waiver_. No failure by any party to insist upon the
strict performance of any covenant, duty, agreement or condition of this
Agreement or to exercise any right or remedy consequent upon a breach
thereof shall constitute waiver of any such breach or any covenant, duty,
agreement or condition.

Section 4.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in

Agreement contains the entire understanding and agreement among the Partners
with respect to the subject matter hereof and amends, restates and supersedes
the OP Agreement and any other prior written or oral understandings or
agreements among them with respect thereto. The parties hereto agree that, to
the extent of any conflict between the provisions of the OP Agreement and the
provisions of this Agreement with respect to the rights, obligations or
remedies of any such party under this Agreement, the provisions of this
Agreement shall control.

  



  

Section 4.15 _No Rights as Stockholders_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be construed as conferring upon the holders of the OP Units
any rights whatsoever as stockholders of the REIT, including,
without limitation, any right to receive dividends or other distributions
made to stockholders of the REIT or to vote or to consent or to receive
notice as stockholders in respect of any meeting of stockholders for the
election of directors of the REIT or any other matter.

  



  

Section 4.16 _Partners ' Representative Matters_.

  



  

(a) The Protected Partners agree that it is desirable to designate a
Person to act as the Partners' Representative for purposes of this Agreement
with all powers, authority, rights, privileges and protections set forth in
this Agreement. Each Protected Partner hereby grants to PELP (which, as used
in this _Section 4.16_ , shall include any designee or successor of PELP)
the full power and authority, on behalf of such Protected Partner, to appoint
the Partners' Representative in PELP's sole and absolute discretion, and any
such Person so chosen shall be deemed for all purposes under this Agreement or
otherwise as having been designated by each such Protected Partner. PELP
hereby designates Jeffrey S. Edison as the initial Partners'
Representative, and each Protected Partner acknowledges such designation. In
the event the Partners' Representative is unwilling or unable to continue to
act as Partners' Representative, PELP shall appoint his successor. Each
successor Partners' Representative shall have all of the power, authority,
rights, privileges and protections conferred by this Agreement upon the
initial Partners' Representative, and the term "Partners' Representative"
shall include any interim or successor representative.

hereby grants to the Partners' Representative, such power, authority, rights,
privileges and protections as are necessary to carry out the functions
assigned to it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ that the Partners'
Representative shall have no obligation to act, except as expressly provided
in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Partners' Representative shall have full power, authority and discretion
to (i) submit any Approval of the Partners' Representative with respect to
the matters specified in this Agreement, (ii) estimate and determine the
amounts of Partners' Representative Expenses and to pay such Partners'

any and all actions, or elect not to take actions, that it believes are
necessary under or contemplated by this Agreement, irrespective of whether
such actions or election not to take actions may result in disparate outcomes
for each Protected Partner, it being expressly agreed by each Protected
Partner that, when exercising its authority under this Agreement, the
Partners' Representative shall have no obligation to take into consideration
the specific tax or other attributes of any single Protected Partner or group
of Protected Partners, but may take into consideration only such facts,
circumstances and considerations (including its own interests) as it
determines in its sole and absolute discretion are relevant to such exercise
of authority. All actions taken by the Partners' Representative under this
Agreement shall be binding on the Protected Partners and their
respective successors and assigns as if expressly confirmed and ratified in
writing by each of them. The parties hereto may rely upon any decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Partners' Representative as being the decision,
act, consent or instruction of each of the Protected Partners.

  



  

(c) From time to time, the Partners' Representative shall be entitled
to submit to PELP an estimate of any costs, fees and expenses incurred, or
that may be in the future incurred, by the Partners' Representative in
connection with exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder in
its capacity as the Partners' Representative (the " _Partners '
Representative Expenses_"). PELP shall promptly pay to the Partners'
Representative and/or to such other persons (and in such amounts) as may be
designated in writing to PELP by the Partners' Representative, by wire
transfer to an account or accounts designated by the Partners' Representative
to PELP in writing, of immediately available funds in the amount of such
Partners' Representative Expenses.

(d) Each Protected Partner agrees that (i) this Agreement is not
intended to, and does not, create or impose any fiduciary or other
similar duty on the Partners' Representative (or PELP in exercising its
authority to designate the Partners' Representative), (ii) such Protected
Partner hereby disclaims and waives any and all duties owed to such Protected
Partner by the Partners' Representative (including those duties that, absent
such waiver, may be implied by law), (iii) the only duties and obligations of
the Partners' Representative (in such capacity) to any Person are only as
expressly set forth in this Agreement, (iv) actions taken (or elected not to
be taken) by the Partners' Representative that are consistent with the
authority and discretion granted in this Agreement shall be deemed to satisfy
any covenant or good faith and/or fair dealing implied by law, (v) the
Partners' Representative shall have no liability to such Protected Partner or
any other party hereto with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken
in its capacity as the Partners' Representative that are consistent with the
grant of authority made under this Agreement, (vi) the Partners'
Representative shall at all times be entitled to rely on any directions
received from the Protected Partners or any other party hereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Partners' Representative shall not be required to follow
any such direction, (vii) the Partners' Representative shall have no liability
for any actions (or elections not to act) taken under this Agreement, and
shall be indemnified by the Protected Partners for and shall be held
harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Partners'
Representative relating to the Partners' Representative's conduct as
Partners' Representative, in each case, other than losses, liabilities or
expenses resulting from the bad faith or fraud of the Partners'
Representative resulting in material harm to the Protected Partners as a
whole, it being agreed that such exculpation indemnification shall survive
the termination of this Agreement, (viii) the Partners' Representative shall
be entitled to engage counsel, experts, accountants and advisors as it shall
deem necessary in connection with exercising its powers and performing its
function hereunder and shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the opinions
and advice of such Persons and shall have no liability for any actions (or
elections not to act) taken after consultation with such counsel,
experts, accountants and/or advisors and (ix) such Protected Partner
expressly disclaims any right to bring any legal or regulatory action, and
agrees for itself and its successors and assigns that such Protected Partner
will not bring any such legal or regulatory action against, any
representative, member, shareholder, employee, partner, affiliate, controller,
officer or other agent of the Partners' Representative.

3

 



    



  

(b) Transfers to one or more members of such Equity Holder's
Immediate Family or to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of

continue to Beneficially Own such Restricted OP Units throughout the
applicable Lock-up Period;

  



  

(c) Transfers to Affiliates of such Equity Holder, _provided_ that
such Equity Holder or one or more members of his Immediate Family continue to
Beneficially Own such Restricted OP Units throughout the applicable Lock-up
Period;

  



  

(d) Transfers that are bona fide gifts or charitable donations;
and/or

of, tax obligations in respect of phantom income solely attributable to the
ownership of the Restricted OP Units;

  



  

 _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the aggregate amount of any such Transfers by
such Equity Holder described in _clauses (a)_ through  _(e)_ above shall not

ARTICLE III 
  
  _OTHER RIGHTS_

  



  

Section 3.1 _Nomination Rights_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 3.1(b)_ below, the Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) shall continue to include JSE or, subject to 
_Section 3.1(c)_ below, his designee as a nominee in its slate of directors
for election by the REIT's stockholders at each of the ten (10) succeeding
annual meetings following the Closing (or at each special meeting of the
REIT's stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors of the REIT
during such time period), and at any adjournment or postponement thereof. The
REIT agrees to use its reasonably best efforts to solicit the vote of
stockholders of the REIT to elect JSE or, subject to  _Section 3.1(c)_ below,
his designee to the Board (which efforts shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, include the inclusion in any proxy statement
prepared, used, delivered or publicly filed by the REIT to solicit the vote of
its stockholders in connection with any such meeting the recommendation of
the Board that the stockholders of the REIT vote in favor of nominating JSE
or, subject to _Section 3.1(c)_ below, his designee to the Board).

  



  

(b) This nomination right shall automatically terminate in the event
that JSE sells, pledges, donates, gifts or otherwise transfers more than
thirty-five percent (35%) in the aggregate of the OP Units (and any shares of
the common stock of the REIT (" _Common Stock_ ") he receives in exchange
therefor) that he beneficially owns as of the Closing (other than to
Affiliates; provided, however, that beneficial ownership of the OP Units
continues to be held by JSE, his family or estate-planning entities
controlled by JSE).

  



  

(c) Any designee of JSE entitled to be nominated for election to the
Board as provided in this _Section 3.1_ shall be subject to approval by the
Special Committee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  



  

Section 3.2 _Registration and Rule 144 Information Rights_.

  



  

(a) Following any listing of the Common Stock on a national
securities exchange, the REIT shall, to the extent it files a shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _Commission_ ") following the effectiveness of such
listing, (i) provide each Equity Holder the opportunity to be named as a
selling securityholder in such shelf registration statement (or in a separate
"resale" shelf registration statement on Form S-3) (the " _Registration
Statement_ ") and to register such number of shares of Common Stock held by
(or receivable upon the exchange of OP Units held by) such Equity Holder as
such Equity Holder may request and (ii) use reasonable efforts to cause such
Registration Statement to become and remain effective, until the earliest of
(y) such time as no Equity Holder is an Affiliate of the REIT, or (z) the date
on which all shares of Common Stock held by (or receivable upon the exchange
of OP Units held by) each Equity Holder and covered by such
Registration Statement have been sold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of such Registration Statement
would require the REIT to make a public disclosure of material non-public
information, which disclosure in the good faith determination of the REIT (
_i_ ) would be required to be made in any Registration Statement so that such
Registration Statement would not be materially misleading, ( _ii_ ) would not
be required to be made at such time but for the filing, effectiveness or
continued use of such Registration Statement or ( _iii_ ) would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect in any material respect the REIT or its business
or the REIT's ability to effect a bona fide material proposed acquisition,
disposition, financing, reorganization, recapitalization or similar
transaction, then the REIT may, upon giving written notice to each
Equity Holder participating in such registration, delay the filing or initial
effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such Registration Statement (and any
related prospectus), _provided_ that the REIT shall not be permitted to do so
for any single period of time in excess of 90 days, or for periods exceeding,
in the aggregate, 120 days during any 12-month period. In the event that the
REIT exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, each Equity Holder
agrees to suspend, promptly upon receipt of the written notice referred to
above, the use of the Registration Statement (and any related prospectus) in
connection with any sale or offer to sell shares of Common Stock held by (or
receivable upon the exchange of OP Units held by) such Equity Holder
until such Equity Holder is advised in writing by the REIT that the use of
such Registration Statement (and any related prospectus) may be resumed.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

(b) As long as any Equity Holder owns shares of Common Stock or OP
Units, and as long as the REIT is required to file reports under Section 13
or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange
Act_ "), the REIT shall (i) make and keep public information available, as
those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), at all times after the Closing;
(ii) use reasonable efforts to file with the Commission in a timely manner
(or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace
period) all reports and other documents required of the REIT under Section 13
or 15(d) of the Exchange Act at any time after the Closing; and (iii) furnish
to any Equity Holder so long as such Equity Holder owns shares of Common Stock
or OP Units, promptly upon request by such Equity Holder, a written statement
by the REIT as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144
and of the Exchange Act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report
of the REIT, and such other reports and documents so filed or furnished by
the REIT as such Equity Holder may reasonably request.

Summary of Principal Terms for Proposed

  

  

Executive Severance and Change of Control Plan

  



  

The following are the proposed principal terms for a new Executive Severance
and Change in Control Plan (the " _Plan_ ") for Phillips Edison Grocery
Center REIT I, Inc. (the " _Company_ "). The proposed Plan would provide the
Compensation Committee with the flexibility to expand severance and change of
control protections to a greater number of executives without the need for
employment agreements. Other employees not designated by the Compensation
Committee as Participants under the Plan would continue to be subject to the
general severance policy.

  



  

The Compensation Committee would have the flexibility to designate executives
as Participants under the Plan and the Company would enter into a letter
agreement with each designated executive pursuant to which the Company would
agree that the executive was a Plan Participant and the executive would agree
to certain individualized restrictive covenants as noted below. The
proposed Plan terms would be structured to permit different levels of
severance payments for different executive positions.

  



     1.  | Participants  |

Participants  will be designated by the Compensation Committee (and may
include new executives from  time to time) provided that, in order to be a
Participant the executive must execute  a letter agreement with the Company,
which letter agreement will contain the restrictive  covenants relating to
confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation and non-disparagement  as
set forth below. The initial Participants shall consist of

 



 

Jeffrey  Edison (Co-Chairman and CEO)

 

 

Robert  Myers (COO)

 

 

Devin  Murphy (Principal and CFO)

 

 

R.  Mark Addy (President/COO, Non Traded REIT)

  

---|---|--- 
   2.  | Plan  Term/Amendments:  | The  Plan will continue, subject to
amendment, until terminated by the Board. The Board may terminate or amend
the Plan  except that (i) six months prior notice to affected Participants
will be required for any termination of the Plan or  amendment that
materially and adversely affects the rights of such Participants, (ii) no
termination or amendment will  materially and adversely affect the rights of
any Participant whose employment terminated prior to the date of such
amendment  or termination, and (iii) a Participant's right to receive
payments or benefits with respect to a termination occurring  in connection
with or within 12 months after a Change of Control shall not be adversely
affected by an amendment or termination  of the Plan that is made within 6
months before or 12 months after the Change of Control date. A Participant
who  is removed from participation in the Plan will no longer be subject to
any post-employment non-compete/non-solicitation covenants. 
   



  

   

 



    



     3.  | Termination  without Cause by Company, or with Good Reason by
Executive (Not related to a Change in Control) 
---|--- 
     | Severance  Multiple  |

● 2.0x  for CEO

 



 

● 1.5x  for Other Officers

This SERVICES AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of ____________,
2017, (the " _Effective Date_ ") is entered into by and between Phillips
Edison Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (" _PELP_ "), and
[TRS ENTITY] (" _Manager_ "). Manager and PELP are referred to in this
Agreement individually as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the "
_Parties_." Operating Partnership (as defined below) hereby joins this
Agreement for purposes of _Section 3_ hereof.

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Contribution Agreement, dated as of May 18,
2017 (the " _Contribution Agreement_ "), by and among the Contributors (as
defined therein), Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT I, Inc. (the " _REIT_
"), Phillips Edison Grocery Center Operating Partnership I, L.P. ("
_Operating Partnership_ ") and Jeffrey S. Edison, pursuant to which PELP and
each Contributor transferred substantially all of their respective assets to
Operating Partnership;

  



  

WHEREAS, the transactions contemplated in the Contribution Agreement are
being consummated contemporaneously herewith (the " _Closing_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, the corporate organizational chart set forth on _Annex A_ hereto
represents the remaining entities owned by PELP as of the Closing (PELP,
together with such remaining entities, the " _PELP Entities_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, PELP and Manager desire to enter into this Agreement pursuant to
which Manager shall provide certain services to the PELP Entities in order to
provide for the wind-down of the PELP Entities pursuant to the terms and
conditions set forth herein.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the covenants and
agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Appointment of Manager; Services_.

  



  

(a) The PELP Entities set forth on _Annex B_ hereto (the " _Real
Property Entities_ ") own the real estate assets identified opposite their
respective names (the " _Real Properties_ "). A subsidiary of Manager,
Phillips Edison and Company, Ltd, (" _Property Manager_ "), provides property
management and leasing services to the applicable Real Property Entities with
respect to the Real Properties pursuant to the terms of the property
management agreements identified on _Annex B_ (the " _Property Management
Agreements_ "). The Parties acknowledge that two of the Real
Properties identified on Annex B (i.e., Smoketown and Veronica and Cedar Hills
- West) (the " _Vacant Lots_ ") are vacant, unimproved parcels of land, and
are not subject to the Property Management Agreements. Manager agrees that
PELP shall have the right to request that Property Manager provide some
subset of the services set forth in the Property Management Agreements with
respect to the Vacant Lots on terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon
by the Parties. In such event, the Parties will enter into a separate
property management agreement reflecting the agreement with respect to such
additional services.

  



  

   

 



    



  

(b) In connection with the Closing, PELP desires to engage Manager to
provide the following services to the PELP Entities (the " _Services_ ") with
respect to the operation of the businesses of the PELP Entities and the
eventual wind-down, liquidation and termination of the PELP Entities:

  



  

(i) advising PELP with respect to, and implementing on behalf of
PELP, the disposition of any Real Property and/or the liquidation of any
other investment held by any of the PELP Entities;

  



  

(ii) providing finance, accounting and tax services for the PELP
Entities, including (A) tax return preparation, (B) sales tax, personal
property tax, and other tax compliance services, (C) responding to notices
from taxing jurisdictions including audits, (D) calculating and making
distributions and dividends to investors in the PELP Entities, (E) treasury
services relating to the PELP Entities' bank accounts, (F) preparing and
managing a budget for PELP, and (G) preparing and maintaining routine and
customary financial and business books and records for the PELP Entities in a
manner substantially similar to the books and records currently maintained by
the PELP Entities;

  



  

(iii) advising and procuring (at PELP's expense) appropriate insurance
coverage for the business and operation of the PELP Entities and handling
related communications with the applicable insurance providers, and managing
any litigation or threatened litigation relating thereto;

  



  

(iv) maintaining the corporate record books for the PELP Entities and
preparing all necessary filings with the various states of
incorporation/formation (with the costs of all such filings being at PELP's
expense);

  



  

(v) providing and maintaining, at Manager's expense, offices, together
with all administrative services, staff and accommodations
reasonably required for the performance of its duties under this Agreement;
and

  



  

(vi) any other services reasonably requested by PELP to effectuate an
orderly wind-down and liquidation of the PELP Entities; provided that all
filing and third party costs related thereto (including legal and accounting
fees and expenses) are at PELP's expense.

  



  

All Services shall be subject to the prior approval and direction of PELP.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Services are intended to manage entity-level
matters of the PELP Entities and not to duplicate any services being provided
under the Property Management Agreements. In the event of a conflict between
the Property Management Agreements and this Agreement, the Property
Management Agreements shall govern.

  



  

(c) PELP hereby appoints Manager to perform the services described in
_Section 2(b)_ above, and Manager hereby accepts such appointment on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. PELP acknowledges and agrees
that Manager shall have the right to delegate the performance of the Services
to any affiliate under Manager's control or that is controlled by or is under
common control with Manager.

  



  

   

-2-

 



    



  

(d) PELP shall have the right, from time to time and at its sole
discretion, to limit the scope of any of the Services, and/or to engage a
third-party provider (at PELP's expense) to perform such Services for any of
the PELP Entities.

  



  

2. _Standard; Third Party Providers_.

  



  

(a) Manager shall provide the Services in a substantially similar
manner and quality as such Services were provided to PELP prior to the
Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that the Manager will not provide the Services or any other
services in a scope or frequency outside the ordinary course of business,
substantially consistent with past practices, unless the Manager receives the
prior approval of the independent directors of the REIT (such services, the "
_REIT Approved Extraneous Services_ ").

  



  

(b) Manager shall have the right to engage an independent, third party
provider (a " _Third Party Provider_ ") to perform any portion of the
Services subject to the following conditions. Any such Third Party Provider
shall be subject to the prior written approval of PELP. In seeking such
approval, Manager shall provide PELP with a budget or fixed cost arrangement,
together with the engagement and payment terms, for such Third Party
Provider. Any fees or expenses charged by such Third Party Provider in excess
of an approved budget amount, or any change to the engagement and payment
terms thereof, shall require the prior written approval of PELP. PELP shall
be responsible for the timely payment of any invoice from an approved Third
Party Provider. Notwithstanding anything to contrary herein, neither Manager
nor any of its affiliates shall be liable to such a Third Party Provider, PELP
or any other PELP entity for any fees, expenses or other costs related to a
Third Party Provider's provision of any portion of the Services.

  



  

(c) Manager may rely on such Third Party Provider and will not be
liable for any act or omission of any Third Party Provider unrelated
to Manager. To the extent the provision of any Services by a Third Party
Provider do not conform to the standards set forth in this Agreement or under
the terms of such Third Party Provider's engagement letter and Manager becomes
aware of such nonconformance, Manager shall use reasonable efforts to cause
such Third Party Provider to either (i) timely correct the relevant
deficiencies or (ii) cause such Services to be timely re-performed in a
conforming manner.

3. _License of Intellectual Property_. Pursuant to the terms of the Contribution Agreement, at Closing, PELP transferred to the Operating Partnership any right, title and interest PELP may have had to the names "Phillips Edison" and "PECO" (the " _Licensed Names_ "). In connection with such transfer, PELP and the Operating Partnership agreed that PELP and any applicable PELP Entity using the Licensed Names (a " _Licensee_ ") would have the right to use such names in connection with the continued operation of its respective businesses for the duration of the applicable Licensee's License Term (as defined below). Accordingly, Operating Partnership hereby grants to each Licensee a non-transferable (except in connection with a permitted assignment under Section 10(e)), non-assignable (except in connection with a permitted assignment under Section 10(e)), non-sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid up, worldwide, limited right and license to use, reproduce, and exploit the Licensed Names in its corporate name and in connection with the continued operation of such Licensee's business (e.g., in its corporate names, marketing materials, websites, domain names, stationery, and similar uses). For each Licensee, this license shall survive and continue until the earlier of (x) 15 years from the Effective Date, or (y) such time as such Licensee's business has been fully wound-down and liquidated and a certificate of termination or dissolution of such Licensee has been filed in its applicable state of formation or incorporation (the " _License Term_ "). Licensee agrees that all rights and goodwill in the Licensed Name that accrue during the license shall inure to the benefit of the Operating Partnership. Operating Partnership joins in the execution of this Agreement for the purposes of effectuating the foregoing license. Any additional use of the Licensed Names by a Licensee in a manner that deviates from how such Licensed Names were used by such Licensee immediately prior to the Effective Date will require the prior written approval of Operating Partnership. PELP shall (and shall cause the Licensees to) do such things as Operating Partnership may reasonably request, at Operating Partnership's cost and expense, in order for Operating Partnership to retain the ownership and benefit of the Licensed Names. Operating Partnership shall take all actions reasonably necessary to maintain any rights it may have in and to the Licensed Names. For the avoidance of doubt, this license will survive any expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement; it being the express intent of the Parties that this license shall remain in place for each Licensee's applicable License Term.

  



  

4. _Payments, Fees and Costs_.

  



  

(a) PELP shall pay Manager, and Manager shall accept, as compensation
for providing the Services an annual fee of Two Hundred Thousand and 00/100
Dollars ($200,000.00). Such fee will be payable in quarterly installments
equal to Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($50,000.00), in arrears on or
before the tenth (10th) Business Day of each calendar quarter during the Term,
and shall be prorated for any partial quarter. If the Manager provides any
REIT Approved Extraneous Services to PELP, PELP shall pay the Manager a
separate fee for such services as mutually agreed by PELP and the independent
directors of the REIT.

  



  

(b) All other expenses, charges, fees, taxes, personnel charges and
costs relating to the Services shall be the sole expense and
responsibility of Manager, except as otherwise contemplated by _Section 1(b)_
or _Section 2(b)_ above.

  



  

5. _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) During the Term of this Agreement, each Party (" _Recipient_ ") may
have access to, or have disclosed to it, certain confidential information,
data, records, files, archives and other proprietary information, whether oral
or written, concerning, among other things, third party materials,
inventions, know-how, customer lists, supplier lists, pricing, patent and
trade secrets, software, and other general business information
(collectively, the " _Proprietary Information_ ") that is owned by the
other Party (" _Discloser_ "). All Proprietary Information of Discloser or
its affiliates, customers, suppliers or independent contractors generated,
produced or stored by Recipient in connection with the provision of Services
or the performance of this Agreement shall be the Proprietary Information of

(b) During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year
thereafter, each Party agrees, and shall cause its respective affiliates, to
protect the confidentiality of Discloser's Proprietary Information with at
least the same degree of care that it utilizes with respect to its own
similar confidential and proprietary information, but in any event, no less
than reasonable care, including:

  



  

(i) not to disclose or copy, display, publish, transfer (whether by
sale, operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise disseminate or allow access
to the Proprietary Information, in whole or in part, in any form whatsoever,
to or by any third party without the prior written consent of Discloser,
except that such disclosure or access shall be permitted with respect to an
employee or independent contractor of Recipient requiring access to the
Proprietary Information in the course of his or her employment or provision
of Services hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that such employee or
independent contractor is subject to confidentiality obligations
substantially similar and in no event less restrictive than as set forth in
this _Section 5_ and such Recipient shall enforce such obligations;

  



  

(ii) to immediately notify Discloser promptly and in writing of the
circumstances surrounding any suspected possession, use, disclosure or
knowledge of the Proprietary Information or any part thereof at any location
or by any person other than those authorized by this Agreement and to take
further steps as may reasonably be requested by Discloser to remedy any such
possession, use or disclosure; and

  



  

(iii) upon Discloser's request, to promptly return to Discloser, or at
Recipient's request destroy, all documents and materials in tangible form,
and permanently erase all data in electronic form (other than back-ups and
archived data, so long as such data continues to be bound by the
confidentiality obligations of this _Section 5_), containing any Proprietary
Information, and certify in writing signed by an officer of Recipient that
Recipient has fully complied with this obligation (except that
the Recipient's legal counsel may retain one copy of such information in
their offices for record-keeping purposes only).

  



  

(c) Nothing in this _Section 5_ shall restrict the Parties with
respect to data, records, files, archives or other proprietary
or confidential information, whether or not identical or similar to that
contained in the Proprietary Information, if such data, records, files,
archives or other proprietary or confidential information: (i) are
independently developed by Recipient without reference to Discloser's
Proprietary Information; (ii) are or become generally available to the public
other than as a result of any act or default of, or disclosure by, Recipient;
(iii) become available to Recipient on a non-confidential basis from a source
other than Discloser, _provided_ the Recipient believes in good faith that
such source is entitled to disclose such information to the Recipient on a
non-confidential basis; or (iv) were known by Recipient on a non-
confidential basis prior to the disclosure thereof to the Recipient by
Discloser. In addition, to the extent that Proprietary Information
is required by law to be disclosed, such Proprietary Information may be
disclosed; _provided_ that as soon as is reasonably practicable after
receiving notice of any such required disclosure and to the extent that it may
legally do so, Recipient advises Discloser of the same, and prior to making
any such disclosure, takes commercially reasonable actions to assure the
confidential handling of the Proprietary Information, including, to the
extent permissible and practicable, affording Discloser a reasonable period
of time to seek a protective order prohibiting the disclosure of the
Proprietary Information, if allowed by applicable law and cooperates with
Discloser, at Discloser's reasonable request and sole expense, in any lawful
action to contest or limit the scope of such required disclosure.

irreparable harm for which monetary damages may be an inadequate remedy if
there were a breach by such Party of obligations under this _Section 5_. Each
Party further acknowledges and agrees that equitable relief, including
injunctive relief, may be appropriate to protect the non-breaching Party's
rights and interests if such a breach were to arise, be threatened, or be
asserted, and the non-breaching Party will be entitled to seek the entry of
an order for immediate injunctive relief without the necessity of posting a
bond or other security.

Partners.

issued to all Partners holding Partnership Interests in the same class in
proportion to their respective Percentage Interests in such class, without
any approval being required from any Limited Partner or any other Person;
_provided further, however_ , that:

  



  

(i) such issuance does not cause the Partnership to become, with
respect to any employee benefit plan subject to Title I of ERISA or

of ERISA) or a "disqualified person" (as defined in Section 4975(e) of the

less than the gross proceeds of such Offering, grant, award, or issuance as a
result of any underwriter's discount, commission, or fee or other expenses
paid or incurred in connection with such Offering, grant, award, or issuance,
then the Initial Limited Partner shall make a Capital Contribution to the
Partnership in the amount equal to the sum of (i) the net proceeds of such
issuance plus (ii) an intangible asset in an amount equal to the capitalized
costs of the Initial Limited Partner relating to such issuance of Common
Stock. Upon any such Capital Contribution by the Initial Limited Partner, the

Partners acknowledge and agree that, in the event that any such plan is
adopted, modified or terminated by the General Partner or the Initial Limited
Partner, or for any other reason as determined by the General Partner,
amendments to this Section 4.5 may become necessary or advisable, any
approval or Consent to any such amendments requested by the General Partner

authorized to issue Partnership Units (i) in accordance with the terms of any
such equity incentive plans, or (ii) in an amount equal to the number of
shares of Common Stock or other class or series of stock of the Initial
Limited Partner or New Securities issued pursuant to any such equity

Limited Partner, the Initial Limited Partner shall pay to the Partnership any

expenses will be allocated to the Partnership and such other entities in such
a manner as the General Partner in its reasonable discretion deems fair
and reasonable. All payments and reimbursements hereunder shall be

incurred on its behalf, and not as expenses of the General Partner or the
Initial Limited Partner.

organization or reorganization of the Partnership, the General Partner and

Section 707(c) of the Code, shall be treated consistently therewith by the
Partnership and all Partners, and shall not be treated as distributions for
purposes of computing the Partners' Capital Accounts.

_provided_ , _further_ that each of the General Partner and the Initial
Limited Partner may, in its sole and absolute discretion, from time to time

Limited Partner acquires material assets (other than on behalf of the
Partnership), to the extent reasonably determined by the General Partner to be
necessary, the definition of "Exchange Factor" shall be adjusted, as

Incorporation, and interests in Disregarded Entities with respect to the
General Partner or the Initial Limited Partner which hold any of the
foregoing, are interests which the General Partner and the Initial Limited
Partner are permitted to acquire and hold for purposes of this Section
7.5(a). Nothing in this Agreement shall limit, or be deemed to limit, the

   | 7.6| _Indemnification_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) (i)Subject to Section 15.14, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the Partnership shall indemnify each Indemnitee from
and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or
several, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and other legal fees
and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising from
any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, whether by or in the right of the
Partnership or otherwise (subject to (y) below) that relate to the operations
of the Partnership or the Initial Limited Partner (" _ _Actions__ ") as set
forth in this Agreement in which such Indemnitee may be involved, or is
threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Partnership shall not indemnify an Indemnitee (i) if the act or
omission of the Indemnitee was material to the matter giving rise to the
Action and either was committed in bad faith or was the result of active and
deliberate dishonesty; (ii) in the case of any criminal proceeding, if the
Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was
unlawful; or (iii) for any loss resulting from any transaction for which such
Indemnitee actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property
or services or otherwise in violation or breach of any provision of this
Agreement; and provided, further, that no payments pursuant to this Agreement
shall be made by the Partnership (x) to indemnify or advance expenses to any
Indemnitee with respect to any Action initiated or brought voluntarily by
such Indemnitee (and not by way of defense) unless (I) approved or authorized
by the General Partner or (II) incurred to establish or enforce such
Indemnitee's right to indemnification under this Agreement, (y) to advance
expenses in connection with one or more Actions or claims brought by or in the
right of the Partnership or (z) to indemnify an Indemnitee in connection with
one or more Actions involving such Indemnitee if such Indemnitee is found
liable to the Partnership with respect to such claim or Action. If Indemnitee
is entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to one or more but less
than all claims, issues or matters in any Action, the Partnership shall
provide indemnification hereunder in connection with each such claim, issue
or matter, allocated on a reasonable and proportionate basis.

  



  

(ii) Without limitation, the foregoing indemnity shall extend to any
liability of any Indemnitee, pursuant to a loan guaranty or otherwise, for
any indebtedness of the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership
(including any indebtedness which the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the
Partnership has assumed or taken subject to), and the General Partner is
hereby authorized and empowered, in its sole and absolute discretion on
behalf of the Partnership, to enter into one or more indemnity agreements
consistent with the provisions of this Section 7.6 in favor of any Indemnitee
having or potentially having liability for any such indebtedness. It is the
intention of this Section 7.6(a) that the Partnership indemnify each
Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law and this Agreement. The
termination of any proceeding by judgment, order or settlement does not create
a presumption that the Indemnitee did not meet the requisite standard of
conduct set forth in this Section 7.6(a). The termination of any
proceeding by conviction of an Indemnitee or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_
or its equivalent by an Indemnitee, or an entry of an order of probation
against an Indemnitee prior to judgment, does not create a presumption that
such Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary to that specified in this Section
7.6(a) with respect to the subject matter of such proceeding. Any
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.6 shall be made only out of the
assets of the Partnership, and neither the General Partner nor any other
holder shall have any obligation to pay or otherwise satisfy such
indemnification obligation or to contribute to the capital of the
Partnership or otherwise provide funds to enable the Partnership to fund its
obligations under this Section 7.6.

  



  

   

45

 



    



  

(iii) Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.6 shall be made
only out of the assets of the Partnership, and neither the General Partner
nor any Limited Partner shall have any obligation to contribute to the capital
of the Partnership, or otherwise provide funds, to enable the Partnership to
fund its obligations under this Section 7.6.

  



  

(b) Subject to Section 15.14, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
expenses incurred by an Indemnitee who is a party to a proceeding
or otherwise subject to or the focus of or is involved in any Action shall be
paid or reimbursed by the Partnership as incurred by the Indemnitee in
advance of the final disposition of the Action upon receipt by the Partnership
of (i) a written affirmation by the Indemnitee of the Indemnitee's good faith
belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by
the Partnership as authorized in Section 7.7(b) has been met, and (ii) a
written undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay the amount if
it shall ultimately be determined that the standard of conduct has not been
met.

  



  

(c) The indemnification provided by this Section 7.6 shall be in
addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee or any other Person may
be entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the Partners, as a
matter of law or otherwise, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has
ceased to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
successors, assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee unless otherwise
provided in a written agreement with such Indemnitee or in the writing
pursuant to which such Indemnitee is indemnified.

  



  

(d) The Partnership may, but shall not be obligated to, purchase and
maintain insurance, on behalf of any of the Indemnitees and such other
Persons as the General Partner shall determine, against any liability that may
be asserted against or expenses that may be incurred by such Person in
connection with the Partnership's activities, regardless of whether the
Partnership would have the power to indemnify such Person against such
liability under the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(e) Any liabilities which an Indemnitee incurs as a result of acting on
behalf of the Partnership, the General Partner or the Initial Limited Partner
(whether as a fiduciary or otherwise) in connection with the operation,
administration or maintenance of an employee benefit plan or any related
trust or funding mechanism (whether such liabilities are in the form of excise
taxes assessed by the IRS, penalties assessed by the U.S. Department of
Labor, restitutions to such a plan or trust or other funding mechanism or
to a participant or beneficiary of such plan, trust or other funding
mechanism, or otherwise) shall be treated as liabilities or judgments or
fines under this Section 7.6, unless such liabilities arise as a result of (i)
an act or omission of such Indemnitee that was material to the matter giving
rise to the Action and either was committed in bad faith or was the result of
active and deliberate dishonesty; (ii) in the case of any criminal
proceeding, an act or omission that such Indemnitee had reasonable cause to
believe was unlawful, or (iii) any transaction in which such Indemnitee
actually received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

  



  

   

46

 



    



  

(f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject any of the Partners (other
than the General Partner) to personal liability by reason of
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in
part under this Section 7.6 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the
transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(h) (i) The provisions of this Section 7.6 are for the benefit
of the Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators
and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other
Persons.

  



  

(ii) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.6 or any
provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect
the Partnership's liability to any Indemnitee under this Section 7.6, as in
effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification, or repeal with
respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or
in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when
such claims may arise or be asserted.

  



  

(i) If and to the extent any payments to the Initial Limited Partner
pursuant to this Section 7.6 constitute gross income to the Initial Limited
Partner (as opposed to the repayment of advances made on behalf of the
Partnership), such amounts shall constitute guaranteed payments within the
meaning of Section 707(c) of the Code, shall be treated consistently therewith
by the Partnership and all Partners, and shall not be treated as
distributions for purposes of computing the Partners' Capital Accounts.

  



  

(j) Any obligation or liability whatsoever of the General Partner which
may arise at any time under this Agreement or any other
instrument, transaction, or undertaking contemplated hereby shall be
satisfied, if at all, out of the assets of the General Partner or
the Partnership only. No such obligation or liability shall be personally
binding upon, nor shall resort for the enforcement thereof be had to, any of
the General Partner's directors, stockholders, officers, employees, or agents,
regardless of whether such obligation or liability is in the nature of
contract, tort or otherwise.

  



  

(k) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no Indemnitee
shall be liable to the Partnership, any Partner or any other Person bound by
this Agreement for any loss, damage or claim incurred by reason of any act or
omission performed or omitted by such Indemnitee in good faith on behalf of
the Partnership and in a manner reasonably believed to be within the scope of
the authority conferred on such Indemnitee by this Agreement, except that an
Indemnitee shall be liable for any such loss, damage or claim incurred
by reason of such Indemnitee's intentional harm or gross negligence.

remainder of this Section 7.7, the General Partner is under no obligation to
consider the separate interest of the Limited Partners (including the tax
consequences to any Limited Partner or any Assignees) in deciding whether to
cause the Partnership to take (or decline to take) any actions and (ii) shall
not be liable for monetary damages for losses sustained, liabilities incurred,
or benefits not derived by Limited Partners in connection with such
decisions; _provided that_ the General Partner has acted in good faith and

(other than the Initial Limited Partner), the General Partner will endeavor in
good faith to resolve the conflict in a manner not adverse to either the
Stockholders of the Initial Limited Partner or the Limited Partners (other
than the Initial Limited Partner), provided that, to the extent that any such
conflict cannot be resolved in a manner not adverse to either the
Stockholders of the Initial Limited Partner or the Limited Partners (other
than the Initial Limited Partner), the General Partner shall be entitled to
resolve such conflict in favor of the Stockholders of the Initial Limited
Partner. The General Partner shall not be liable for monetary damages for
losses sustained, liabilities incurred, or benefits not derived by the
Limited Partners in connection with any action (or election not to act) in

provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect
the limitations on the liability of the General Partner or the members,
managers or agents of the General Partner, the Initial Limited Partner, or of
the directors, officers, stockholders, employees or agents of the Initial
Limited Partner, or the Indemnitees, to the Partnership, the Partners or any
other Person bound by this Agreement under this Section 7.7 as in
effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with
respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or
in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when
such claims may arise or be asserted.

rights, obligations or remedies of any party to the Tax Protection

each taxable year, preliminary tax information (which information shall be an
estimate based on information available to the Partnership at such time)
reasonably required by the Limited Partners for federal and state income tax
reporting purposes and (ii) no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due
date of the applicable federal income tax returns (taking into account
extensions), a final version of such information, which may include

   | 10.2| _Tax  Elections_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, the General Partner shall, in
its sole and absolute discretion, determine whether to make any
available election pursuant to the Code and the Regulations, including any
election under the BBA Rules and the election under Section 754 of the Code.

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise required by the Tax Protection Agreement or by
any other agreement between the General Partner or the Partnership and any
Partner, the General Partner shall elect a permissible method (which need not
be the same method for each item or property) of eliminating the disparity
between the Gross Asset Value and the tax basis for each item of property
contributed to the Partnership or to a Subsidiary of the Partnership pursuant
to the Regulations promulgated under the provisions of Section 704(c) of the
Code.

  



  

(c) The General Partner shall have the right to seek to revoke any tax
election it makes, including any election under the BBA Rules and the
election under Section 754 of the Code, upon the General Partner's
determination, in its sole and absolute discretion, that such revocation is
in the best interests of the Partners.

  



  

(d) The Partners, intending to be legally bound, hereby authorize the
Partnership to make an election (the " _Safe Harbor Election_ ") to have the
"liquidation value" safe harbor provided in proposed Regulations Section
1.83-3(1) and the proposed Revenue Procedure set forth in Internal Revenue
Service Notice 2005-43, as such safe harbor may be modified when such proposed
guidance is issued in final form or as amended by subsequently issued
guidance (the " _Safe Harbor_ "), apply to any interest in the Partnership
transferred to a service provider while the Safe Harbor Election remains
effective, to the extent such interest meets the Safe Harbor requirements
(collectively, such interests are referred to as " _Safe Harbor Interests_
"). The General Partner is authorized and directed to execute and file the
Safe Harbor Election on behalf of the Partnership and the Partners if and
when the Safe Harbor Election becomes available. The Partnership and the
Partners (including any person to whom an interest in the Partnership is
transferred in connection with the performance of services) hereby agree to
comply with all requirements of the Safe Harbor (including forfeiture
allocations) with respect to all Safe Harbor Interests and to prepare
and file all U.S. federal income tax returns reporting the tax consequences
of the issuance and vesting of Safe Harbor Interests consistent with such
final Safe Harbor guidance. The General Partner is authorized to take such
actions as are necessary to achieve, under the Safe Harbor, the effect that
the election and compliance with all requirements of the Safe Harbor referred
to above would be intended to achieve under proposed Regulations Section
1.83-3, including amending this Agreement.

   | 10.5| _Withholding_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) Each Limited Partner hereby authorizes the Partnership to withhold
from, or pay on behalf of or with respect to, such Limited Partner any amount
of federal, state, local, or foreign taxes that the General Partner determines
that the Partnership is required to withhold or pay with respect to any
amount distributable or allocable to such Limited Partner pursuant to this
Agreement, including any taxes required to be withheld or paid by the
Partnership pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, or 1446 of the Code. For
purposes of this Section 10.5, any tax (including interest and penalties)
assessed against or otherwise required to be paid by the Partnership on
behalf of or with respect to any Partner or otherwise as a result of a
Partner's interest in the Partnership (including any assessment under the BBA
Rules) shall be treated as a withholding tax subject to the provisions of this
Section 10.5, which tax shall be allocated among the Partners (including, in
the case of assessments under the BBA Rules or otherwise, any Person that was
a Partner during the taxable year or other period to which such assessment
relates, even if such Person is not a Partner at the time the assessment is
made or actually paid by the Partnership) as determined in good faith by the
General Partner.

  



  

(b) (i) Any amount paid on behalf of or with respect to a
Limited Partner shall constitute a loan by the Partnership to such Limited
Partner, which loan shall be repaid by such Limited Partner as the case may
be within fifteen (15) days after notice from the General Partner that such
payment must be made unless

  



  

(A) the Partnership withholds such payment from a distribution which
would otherwise be made to the Limited Partner; or

  



  

(B) the General Partner determines, in its sole and absolute
discretion, that such payment may be satisfied out of the available funds of
the Partnership which would, but for such payment, be distributed to the
Limited Partner.

  



  

(ii) Any amounts withheld pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i)(A) or
(B) shall be treated as having been distributed to the Limited
Partner (except that, with respect to assessments under the BBA Rules, such
amounts shall (x) be treated as expenditures of the Partnership described in
Section 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code, (y) be specially allocated to the Partners
to whom such amounts are attributable, as determined in good faith by the
General Partner, and (z) reduce the amounts otherwise distributable to such
Partners under this Agreement, as if such amounts were distributed to them,
as determined in good faith by the General Partner).

  



  

(c) (i) Each Limited Partner hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably grants to the Partnership a security interest in such Limited
Partner's Partnership Interest to secure such Limited Partner's obligation to
pay to the Partnership any amounts required to be paid pursuant to this
Section 10.5.

  



  

(ii) (A) If a Limited Partner fails to pay when due any amounts
owed to the Partnership pursuant to this Section 10.5, the General
Partner may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to make the payment
to the Partnership on behalf of such defaulting Limited Partner, and in such
event shall be deemed to have loaned such amount to such defaulting Limited
Partner and shall succeed to all rights and remedies of the Partnership as
against such defaulting Limited Partner.

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

(B) Without limitation, in such event, the General Partner shall have
the right to receive distributions that would otherwise be distributable to
such defaulting Limited Partner until such time as such loan, together with
all interest thereon, has been paid in full, and any such distributions so
received by the General Partner shall be treated as having been distributed to
the defaulting Limited Partner and immediately paid by the defaulting Limited
Partner to the General Partner in repayment of such loan.

  



  

(iii) Any amount payable by a Limited Partner hereunder shall bear
interest at the highest base or prime rate of interest published from time to
time by The Wall Street Journal but in no event higher than the maximum lawful
rate of interest on such obligation, such interest to accrue from the date
such amount is due (i.e., fifteen (15) days after demand) until such amount is
paid in full.

  



  

(iv) Each Limited Partner shall take such actions as the Partnership or
the General Partner shall request in order to perfect or enforce the security
interest created hereunder.

   | 11.2| _Transfer  Restrictions in Business Combinations_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The General Partner may not Transfer any of its General Partner
Interest or withdraw as General Partner, or Transfer any of its
Limited Partner Interest, except

  



  

   

59

 



    



  

(i) with the Consent of the Limited Partners to such Transfer or
withdrawal; 

  



  

(ii) if the General Partner Transfers all of its General Partner
Interest to the Initial Limited Partner; or

  



  

(iii) if such Transfer is to an entity which is wholly owned by the
General Partner or the Initial Limited Partner and is a Qualified
REIT Subsidiary.

  



  

It is a condition to any Transfer of the General Partner's General Partner

(b) If the General Partner withdraws as general partner of the

recapitalization or change of any outstanding shares of the Initial Limited
Partner's stock or other equity interests (other than a change in par value,
or from par value to no par value, or as a result of a subdivision or
combination of Common Stock) (a " _Transaction_ "), unless

  



  

(i) in connection with the Transaction all Limited Partners (other than
the Initial Limited Partner) will either receive, or will have the right to
elect to receive on substantially identical terms as holders of Common Stock,
for each OP Unit an amount of cash, securities, or other property equal to
the product of the Exchange Factor and the greatest amount of cash, securities
or other property or value paid in the Transaction (as applicable based on
the consideration payable to holders of Common Stock) to or received by a
holder of one share of Common Stock in consideration of one share of Common
Stock pursuant to such Transaction or, if greater, at any time during the
period from and after the date on which the Transaction is consummated;
_provided, however, _ that if, in connection with the Transaction, a
purchase, tender or exchange offer (" _Offer_ ") shall have been made to and
accepted by the holders of the outstanding Common Stock, each holder of OP
Units also shall be given the option to exchange its OP Units for the
greatest amount of cash, securities, or other property which a Limited Partner

(A) exercised its Redemption Right pursuant to Section 15.1 and

  



  

   

60

 



    



  

(B) sold, tendered or exchanged pursuant to the Offer the Common Stock
received upon exercise of its Redemption Right pursuant to Section 15.1
immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer.

  



  

The foregoing is not intended to, and does not, affect the ability of (i) a
Stockholder of the Initial Limited Partner to sell its stock in the Initial
Limited Partner or (ii) the Initial Limited Partner to perform its obligations
(under agreement or otherwise) to such Stockholders (including the
fulfillment of any obligations with respect to registering the sale of stock
under applicable securities laws); or

  



  

(ii) all the following conditions are met: (w) substantially all
of the assets directly or indirectly owned by the surviving entity are owned
directly or indirectly by the Partnership or another limited partnership or
limited liability company which is the survivor of a merger, consolidation or
combination of assets with the Partnership (in each case, the "Surviving
Partnership"); (x) the Limited Partners that held OP Units immediately prior
to the Transaction own a percentage interest of the Surviving
Partnership based on the relative fair market value of the net assets of the
Partnership and the other net assets of the Surviving Partnership immediately
prior to the consummation of such transaction; (y) the rights, preferences and
privileges of such Limited Partners in the Surviving Partnership are at least
as favorable as those in this Agreement and as those applicable to any other
limited partners or non-managing members of the Surviving Partnership; and
(z) the rights of the such Limited Partners include at least the following:
(a) the right to redeem their interests in the Surviving Partnership for the
consideration available to such persons pursuant to Section 11.2(c)(i) or (b)
the right to redeem their interests in the Surviving Partnership for cash on
terms equivalent to those in effect with respect to their OP Units in this
Agreement, or, if the ultimate controlling person of the Surviving
Partnership has publicly traded common equity securities, such common equity
securities, with an exchange ratio based on the determination of relative
fair market value of such securities and the Common Stock.

  



  

(iii) The above provisions of this Section 11.2(c)(i) or (ii), as the
case may be, shall similarly apply to successive mergers or
consolidations permitted hereunder.

  



  

   

61

 



    



  

(d) Neither the Initial Limited Partner nor the General Partner, as
applicable, shall consummate (v) a merger, consolidation or other
combination involving a Change of Control, (w) any merger involving the
Partnership, (x) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Initial Limited Partner or the Partnership to any "person" (as such term is
used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act), (y) any OP Unit
issuance in respect of a transaction (a " _Stockholder Vote Transaction_
," and each Stockholder Vote Transaction or other transaction described in
subclauses (v), (w), and (x) of this Section 11.2(d), a " _Partnership Vote
Transaction_ ") required to be submitted for the approval of the holders of
Common Stock (a " _Stockholder Vote_ ") unless: (i) the General Partner first
provides the Limited Partners with advance notice at least equal in time to
the advance notice given to holders of Common Stock in connection with such
Stockholder Vote (or if no Stockholder Vote is required, advance notice at
least equal in time to the advance notice that would be given to holders
of Common Stock if a Stockholder Vote were required), (ii) in connection with
such advance notice, the General Partner provides the Limited Partners with
written materials describing the proposed Partnership Vote Transaction (which
may consist of the proxy statement or registration statement used in
connection with a Stockholder Vote, if applicable) and (iii) the Partnership
Vote Transaction is approved by the holders of the Partnership Units (the "
_Partnership Vote_ ") at the same level of approval as required for the
Stockholder Vote (or if no Stockholder Vote is required, the level of approval
that would be required if a Stockholder Vote were required) (for example, (x)
if the approval of holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled
to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter is required
to approve the Stockholder Vote Transaction in the Stockholder Vote, then the
approval of holders of outstanding Partnership Units (including votes deemed
to be cast by the General Partner) entitled to cast a majority of votes
entitled to be cast on the matter will be required to approve the Partnership
Vote Transaction in the Partnership Vote or (y) if the approval of a majority
of the votes cast by holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock present at
a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present is required to approve
the Stockholder Vote Transaction in the Stockholder Vote, then the approval
of a majority of the votes cast (including votes deemed to be cast by the
General Partner) by holders of outstanding Partnership Units present at a
meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present will be required to
approve the Partnership Vote Transaction in the Partnership Vote). For
purposes of the Partnership Vote, (i) each Partner holding Partnership Units
(other than the Initial Limited Partner or any of its Subsidiaries) shall be
entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the total number of Partnership
Units held by such Partner as of the record date for the Stockholder Meeting,
and (ii) the Initial Limited Partner and its Subsidiaries shall not be
entitled to vote thereon and shall instead be deemed to have cast a number of
votes equal to the sum of (x) the total number of Partnership Units held by
the Initial Limited Partner and its Subsidiaries as of the Record Date for
the Stockholder Meeting plus (y) the total number of shares of unvested
restricted shares of Common Stock with respect to which the General Partner
does not hold back-to-back OP Units as of the Record Date for the
Stockholder Meeting, in proportion to the manner in which all outstanding
shares of Common Stock were voted in the Stockholder Vote (for
example, "For," "Against," "Abstain" and "Not Present"). Any such Partnership
Vote will be taken in accordance with Section 14.2 below (including Section
14.2(b) thereof permitting actions to be taken by written consent without a
meeting), _mutatis mutandis_ to give effect to the foregoing provisions of
this Section 11.2(d), except that, solely for purposes of determining whether
a quorum is present at any meeting of the Partners at which a Partnership Vote
will occur, the Initial Limited Partner and its Subsidiaries shall be
considered to be entitled to cast at such meeting all votes that the Initial
Limited Partner and its Subsidiaries will be deemed to have cast in such
Partnership Vote as provided in this Section 11.2(d). For sake of greater
clarity, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary
(including, but not limited to, Section 13.1(b), Section 14.1 and Section
16.3), no Limited Partner shall have voting or consent rights in connection
with any transaction described in Section 11.2(c) other than those set forth
in Section 11.2(c) or in this Section 11.2(d).

  



  

   

62

 



    



   | 11.3| _Permitted  Transfers; Right of First Refusal_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) Prior to the end of the Initial Holding Period, no Limited Partner
shall Transfer all or any portion of its Partnership Interest to any
transferee without the consent of the General Partner, which consent may be
withheld in its sole and absolute discretion;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
any Limited Partner may, at any time, without the consent of the General
Partner, (i) Transfer all or part of its Partnership Interest to any member
of its Immediate Family, any Charity, any Controlled Entity or any
Affiliate, or (ii) pledge (a " _Pledge_ ") all or any portion of its
Partnership Interest to a lending institution that is not an Affiliate of
such Limited Partner as collateral or security for a bona fide loan or other
extension of credit, and Transfer such pledged Partnership Interest to such
lending institution in connection with the exercise of remedies under such
loan or extension of credit (any Transfer or Pledge permitted by this proviso
is hereinafter referred to as a " _Permitted Transfer_ "). After the Initial
Holding Period, subject to the provisions of Sections 11.3(c), 11.3(d),
11.3(e), 11.4 and 11.6, a Limited Partner (other than the Initial Limited
Partner) may, without the consent of the General Partner, Transfer all or any
portion of its Limited Partner Interest, or any of such Limited Partner's
economic right as a Limited Partner, subject to satisfaction of each of the
following conditions:

  



  

(i) _General Partner Right of First Refusal_. The transferring Partner
(or the Partner's estate in the event of the Partner's death) shall give
written notice of the proposed Transfer to the General Partner, which notice
shall state (i) the identity and address of the proposed transferee and (ii)
the amount and type of consideration proposed to be received for the
transferred Partnership Units. The General Partner shall have two (2)
Business Days upon which to give the transferring Partner notice of its
election to acquire the Partnership Units on the terms set forth in such
notice. If it so elects, it shall purchase the Partnership Units on such
terms within three (3) Business Days after giving notice of such election;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such closing may be deferred for up to forty-
five (45) days to the extent necessary to effect compliance with the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act, if applicable, and any other applicable
requirements of law. If it does not so elect, the transferring Partner may
Transfer such Partnership Units to a third party, on terms no more favorable
to the transferee than the proposed terms, subject to the other conditions of
this Section 11.3.

  



  

(ii) _Qualified Transferee_. Any Transfer of a Partnership Interest
shall be made only to a Qualified Transferee.

  



  

(iii) _Opinion of Counsel_. The Transferor shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to the General Partner an opinion of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to it to the effect that the proposed Transfer may be
effected without registration under the Securities Act and will not otherwise
violate the registration provisions of the Securities Act and the regulations
promulgated thereunder or violate any state securities laws or regulations
applicable to the Partnership or the Partnership Interests Transferred;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the General Partner may, in its sole
discretion, waive this condition upon the request of the Transferor.

  



  

(iv) _Minimum Transfer Restriction_. Any Transferring Partner must
Transfer not less than the lesser of (i) five hundred (500) Partnership Units
or (ii) all of the remaining Partnership Units owned by such Transferring
Partner, unless, in each case, otherwise agreed to by the General Partner in
its sole and absolute discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes
of determining compliance with the foregoing restriction, all Partnership
Units owned by Affiliates of a Limited Partner shall be considered to be
owned by such Limited Partner.

  



  

   

63

 



    



  

(v) _Exception for Permitted Transfers_. The conditions of Sections
11.3(a)(i) through 11.3(a)(iv) hereof shall not apply in the case of
a Permitted Transfer.

  



  

In order to effect such transfer, the Limited Partner must deliver to the
General Partner a duly executed copy of the instrument making such transfer
and such instrument must evidence the written acceptance by the assignee of
all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and represent that such
assignment was made in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any transferee of any transferred Partnership
Interest shall be subject to any and all restrictions on ownership or
transfer of stock of the Initial Limited Partner contained in the Articles of
Incorporation that may limit or restrict such transferee's ability to
exercise its redemption rights, including, without limitation, any Ownership
Limit. Any transferee, whether or not admitted as a Substituted Limited
Partner, shall take subject to the obligations of the transferor hereunder.
Unless admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner, no transferee, whether by a
voluntary Transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, shall have any rights
hereunder, other than the rights of an Assignee as provided in Section 11.5
hereof.

  



  

(b) (i) If a Limited Partner is Incapacitated, the executor,
administrator, trustee, committee, guardian, conservator or receiver of
such Limited Partner's estate shall have all of the rights of a Limited
Partner, but not more rights than those enjoyed by other Limited Partners,
for the purpose of settling or managing the estate and such power as the
Incapacitated Limited Partner possessed to Transfer all or any part of his or
its interest in the Partnership.

  



  

(ii) The Incapacity of a Limited Partner, in and of itself, shall not
dissolve or terminate the Partnership.

  



  

(c) The General Partner may prohibit any Transfer by a Limited Partner
of its Partnership Units if it reasonably believes (based on the advice of
counsel) such Transfer would require filing of a registration statement under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or would otherwise violate any
federal or state securities laws or regulations applicable to the Partnership
or the Partnership Units.

  



  

(d) No Transfer by a Limited Partner of its Partnership Units may be
made to any Person if

  



  

(i) it could adversely affect the ability of the Initial Limited
Partner to continue to qualify as a REIT or would subject the Initial Limited
Partner to any additional taxes under Section 857 or Section 4981 of the Code;

  



  

(ii) it could result in the Partnership being treated as an association
taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes;

  



  

(iii) such Transfer would cause the Partnership to become, with respect
to any employee benefit plan subject to Title I of ERISA, a "party-in-
interest" (as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA) or a "disqualified person"
(as defined in Section 4975(c) of the Code);

  



  

(iv) such Transfer would, in the opinion of legal counsel for the
Partnership, cause any portion of the assets of the Partnership to
constitute assets of any employee benefit plan pursuant to Department of
Labor Regulations Section 2510.2-101;

  



  

   

64

 



    



  

(v) such Transfer would subject the Partnership to regulation under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, each as amended;

  



  

(vi) such Transfer is a sale or exchange, and such sale or exchange
would, when aggregated with all other sales and exchanges during the 12-month
period ending on the date of the proposed Transfer, result in 50% or more of
the interests in Partnership capital and profits being sold or exchanged
during such 12-month period without the consent of the General Partner, which
consent may be withheld in its sole and absolute discretion; or

  



  

(vii) such Transfer could be treated as effectuated through an

constitutes a nonrecourse liability (within the meaning of Section
1.752-1(a)(2) of the Regulations), without the consent of the General Partner,
which may be withheld in its sole and absolute discretion; _provided,
however,_ that as a condition to such consent the lender will be required
to enter into an arrangement with the Partnership and the General Partner to
exchange for the Cash Amount any Partnership Units in which a security
interest is held simultaneously with the time at which such lender would be
deemed to be a partner in the Partnership for purposes of allocating
liabilities to such lender under Section 752 of the Code.

  



  

(f) Any Transfer in contravention of any of the provisions of this
Section 11.3 shall be void and ineffectual and shall not be binding upon, or
recognized by, the Partnership.

  



   | 11.4| _Substituted  Limited Partners_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) (i) No Limited Partner shall have the right to substitute

 (iii) The General Partner's failure or refusal to permit such transferee to become a Substituted Limited Partner shall not give rise to any cause of action against the Partnership or any Partner.

  



  

(b) A transferee who has been admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner
in accordance with this Article 11 shall have all the rights and powers and
be subject to all the restrictions and liabilities of a Limited Partner under

(ii) Upon the admission of a Substituted Limited Partner, the General
Partner shall update the Register to reflect the name, address, number of
Partnership Units, and Percentage Interest of such Substituted Limited
Partner, and to eliminate or adjust, if necessary, the name, address and

   | 11.5| _Assignees_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) If the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, does
not consent to the admission of any transferee as a Substituted Limited
Partner, as described in Section 11.4(a), such transferee shall be considered
an Assignee for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) An Assignee shall be deemed to have had assigned to it, and shall
be entitled to receive distributions from the Partnership and the share of
Net Income, Net Losses, and any other items of gain, loss, deduction or credit
of the Partnership attributable to the Partnership Units assigned to such
transferee, but shall not be deemed to be a holder of Partnership Units for
any other purpose under this Agreement, and shall not be entitled to vote
such Partnership Units in any matter presented to the Limited Partners, for a
vote (such Partnership Units being deemed to have been voted on such matter in
the same proportion as all other Partnership Units held by Limited Partners
are voted).

  



  

(c) If any such transferee desires to make a further assignment of any
such Partnership Units, such transferee shall be subject to all of the
provisions of this Article 11 to the same extent and in the same manner as any
Limited Partner desiring to make an assignment of Partnership Units.

  



   | 11.6| _General  Provisions_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) No Limited Partner may withdraw from the Partnership other than as

Partnership Units pursuant to an exchange of all of its Partnership
Units pursuant to Section 15.1 shall cease to be a Limited Partner.

  



  

   

66

 



    



  

(c) Other than pursuant to Section 15.1 or with the consent of the
General Partner, transfers pursuant to this Article 11 may only be made as of
the first day of a fiscal quarter of the Partnership.

  



  

(d) (i) If any Partnership Interest is transferred or assigned
during the Partnership Year in compliance with the provisions of this
Article 11 or exchanged pursuant to Section 15.1 on any day other than the
first day of a Partnership Year, then Net Income, Net Losses, each item
thereof and all other items attributable to such interest for such Partnership
Year shall be divided and allocated between the transferor Partner and the
transferee Partner by taking into account their varying interests during the
Partnership Year in accordance with Section 706(d) of the Code and Section
1.706-4 of the Regulations, using the interim closing of the books method or
such other method permitted by the Code and the Regulations as the General
Partner may select, which selection shall be set forth in a dated, written
statement maintained with the Partnership's books and records. The Partners
hereby agree that any such selection by the General Partner is made by
"agreement of the partners" within the meaning of Section 1.706-4(f) of the
Regulations.

  



  

(ii) Solely for purposes of making such allocations, each of such items
for the calendar month in which the Transfer or assignment occurs shall be
allocated to the transferee Partner, and none of such items for the calendar
month in which an exchange occurs shall be allocated to the exchanging
Partner, _provided_ , _however_ , that the General Partner may adopt such
other conventions relating to allocations in connection with transfers,
assignments, or exchanges as it determines are necessary or appropriate.

  



  

(iii) All distributions pursuant to Section 5.1(a) attributable to
Partnership Units, with respect to which the Partnership Record Date is
before the date of such Transfer, assignment, or exchange of such Partnership
Units, shall be made to the transferor Partner or the exchanging Partner, as
the case may be, and in the case of a Transfer or assignment other than an
exchange, all distributions pursuant to Section 5.1(a) thereafter
attributable to such Partnership Units shall be made to the transferee
Partner.

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

(e) In addition to any other restrictions on transfer herein contained,
including the provisions of this Article 11, in no event may any Transfer or
assignment of a Partnership Interest by any Partner (including pursuant to
Section 15.1) be made without the express consent of the General Partner, in
its sole and absolute discretion, (i) to any person or entity who lacks the
legal right, power or capacity to own a Partnership Interest; (ii) in
violation of applicable law; (iii) of any component portion of a
Partnership Interest, such as the Capital Account, or rights to
distributions, separate and apart from all other components of a
Partnership Interest; (iv) if in the opinion of legal counsel to the
Partnership such transfer would cause a termination of the Partnership for
federal or state income tax purposes (except as a result of the exchange for
Common Stock of all Partnership Units held by all Limited Partners or
pursuant to a transaction expressly permitted under Section 11.2); (v) if in
the opinion of counsel to the Partnership, there would be a significant risk
that such transfer would cause the Partnership to cease to be classified as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes (except as a result of the
exchange for Common Stock of all Partnership Units held by all Limited
Partners or pursuant to a transaction expressly permitted under Section 11.2);
(vi) if such transfer requires the registration of such Partnership Interest
pursuant to any applicable federal or state securities laws; (vii) if such
transfer is effectuated through an "established securities market" or a
"secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof)" within the meaning
of Section 7704 of the Code, such transfer would result in the Partnership
being unable to qualify for one or more (as selected by the General Partner)
of the "safe harbors" set forth in Section 1.7704-1 of the Regulations (or
such other guidance subsequently published by the IRS setting forth safe
harbors under which interests will not be treated as "readily tradable on a
secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof)" within the
meaning of Section 7704 of the Code) (the " _PTP Safe Harbors_ "), or such
transfer causes the Partnership to become a "publicly traded partnership," as
such term is defined in Section 469(k)(2) or Section 7704(b) of the Code (
_provided, however,_ that this clause (vii) shall not be the basis for
limiting or restricting in any manner the exercise of the Redemption Right
under Section 15.1 unless, and only to the extent that, outside tax counsel
provides to the General Partner an opinion to the effect that, in the absence
of such limitation or restriction, there is a significant risk that the
Partnership will be treated as a "publicly traded partnership" and, by reason
thereof, taxable as a corporation); (viii) such transfer could
adversely affect the ability of the Initial Limited Partner to remain
qualified as a REIT; or (ix) if in the opinion of legal counsel of the
transferring Partner (which opinion and counsel are reasonably satisfactory to
the Partnership), or legal counsel of the Partnership, such transfer could
adversely affect the ability of the Initial Limited Partner to continue to
qualify as a REIT or subject the Initial Limited Partner to any additional
taxes under Section 857 or Section 4981 of the Code, if the Initial Limited
Partner has elected to be qualified as a REIT.

  



  

(f) The General Partner shall monitor the transfers of interests in the
Partnership to determine (i) if such interests are being traded on an
"established securities market" or a "secondary market (or the substantial
equivalent thereof)" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code; and (ii)
whether additional transfers of interests would result in the
Partnership being unable to qualify for one or more (as selected by the
General Partner) of the PTP Safe Harbors. The General Partner shall take all
steps reasonably necessary or appropriate to prevent any trading of interests
or any recognition by the Partnership of transfers made on such markets and,
except as otherwise provided herein, to ensure that one or more (as selected
by the General Partner) of the PTP Safe Harbors is met; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not authorize the General Partner to
limit or restrict in any manner the right of any holder of a Partnership Unit
to exercise the Redemption Right in accordance with Section 15.1 unless, and
only to the extent that, outside tax counsel provides to the General Partner
an opinion to the effect that, in the absence of such limitation or
restriction, there is a significant risk that the Partnership will be treated
as a "publicly traded partnership" and, by reason thereof, taxable as a
corporation.

loss to the Partners, the Liquidator may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, defer for a reasonable time the liquidation of any asset except
those necessary to satisfy liabilities of the Partnership (including to those
Partners as creditors) or distribute to the Partners, in lieu of cash, as

properties at such time.

  



  

(iii) The Liquidator shall determine the fair market value of any
property distributed in kind using such reasonable method of valuation as it
may adopt.

  



  

(c) In the discretion of the Liquidator, a pro rata portion of the
distributions that would otherwise be made to the General Partner, the
Limited Partners pursuant to this Article 13 may be:

Partner and the Limited Partners for the purposes of liquidating
Partnership assets, collecting amounts owed to the Partnership, and paying
any contingent or unforeseen liabilities or obligations of the Partnership or
the General Partner arising out of or in connection with the Partnership; the
assets of any such trust shall be distributed to the General Partner and the
Limited Partners from time to time, in the reasonable discretion of the
Liquidator, in the same proportions as the amount distributed to such trust
by the Partnership would otherwise have been distributed to the General
Partner and the Limited Partners pursuant to this Agreement; or

  



  

(B) withheld or escrowed to provide a reasonable reserve for
Partnership liabilities (contingent or otherwise) and to reflect the
unrealized portion of any installment obligations owed to the Partnership,
provided that such withheld or escrowed amounts shall be distributed to the
General Partner and the Limited Partners in the manner and order of priority
set forth in Section 13.2(a), as soon as practicable.

  



   | 13.3| _Negative  Capital Account_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Except as otherwise agreed to in writing by any Partner, if any Partner has a
deficit balance in his Capital Account (after giving effect to all
contributions, distributions and allocations for all taxable years, including
the year during which such liquidation occurs), such Partner shall have no
obligation to make any contribution to the capital of the Partnership with
respect to such deficit, and such deficit shall not be considered a debt owed
to the Partnership or to any other Person for any purpose whatsoever.

  



   | 13.4| _Rights  of Limited Partners_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Limited
Partner shall look solely to the assets of the Partnership for the return of

If a Liquidating Event occurs or an event occurs that would, but for the
provisions of an election or objection by one or more Partners pursuant to
Section 13.1, result in a dissolution of the Partnership, the General Partner
shall, within thirty (30) days thereafter, provide written notice thereof to
each of the Partners.

of Limited Partnership_ 
---|---|---

provided in Section 13.2 hereof, the Partnership shall be terminated, a
certificate of cancellation shall be filed, and all qualifications of the

state of Delaware shall be canceled and such other actions as may be necessary
to terminate the Partnership shall be taken.

---|---|--- 
  



  

A reasonable time shall be allowed for the orderly winding-up of the business
and affairs of the Partnership and the liquidation of its assets pursuant to
Section 13.2 hereof in order to minimize any losses otherwise attendant upon

Article 15 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS

  



   | 15.1| _Redemption  Rights of Qualifying Parties_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) After the applicable Initial Holding Period, a Qualifying Party
shall have the right (subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein)
(the " _Redemption Right_ ") to require the Partnership to redeem all or a
portion of the applicable OP Units held by such Tendering Party (OP Units
that have in fact been tendered for redemption being hereafter referred to as
" _Tendered Units_ _" )_ in exchange (a " _Redemption_ ") for the Cash Amount
payable on the Specified Redemption Date. The Partnership may, in the General
Partner's sole and absolute discretion, redeem Tendered Units at the request
of the holder thereof prior to the end of the applicable Initial Holding
Period (subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein) (a " _Special
Redemption_ "). Any Redemption shall be exercised pursuant to a Notice of
Redemption delivered to the General Partner by the Qualifying Party when
exercising the Redemption Right (the " _Tendering Party_ ").
The Partnership's obligation to effect a Redemption, however, shall not arise
or be binding against the Partnership until the earlier of (i) the date the
General Partner notifies the Tendering Party that the General Partner declines
to require the Initial Limited Partner to acquire some or all of the Tendered
Units under Section 15.1(b) hereof following receipt of a Notice of
Redemption and (ii) the Business Day following the Cut-Off Date. In the event
of a Redemption, the Cash Amount shall be delivered as a certified or bank
check payable to the Tendering Party or, in the General Partner's sole and
absolute discretion, in immediately available funds, in each case, on or
before the Specified Redemption Date.

  



  

   

77

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 15.1(a) hereof, on or
before the close of business on the Cut-Off Date, the General Partner may,
in the General Partner's sole and absolute discretion but subject to the
Ownership Limit, elect to require the Initial Limited Partner to acquire some
or all (such percentage being referred to as the "Applicable Percentage") of
the Tendered Units from the Tendering Party in exchange for shares of Common
Stock or the Cash Amount payable on the Specified Redemption Date. If the
General Partner elects to require the Initial Limited Partner to acquire some
or all of the Tendered Units pursuant to this Section 15.1(b), the General
Partner shall give written notice thereof to the Tendering Party on or before
the close of business on the Cut-Off Date. If the General Partner elects to
require the Initial Limited Partner to acquire any of the Tendered Units for
shares of Common Stock, the Initial Limited Partner shall issue and deliver
such Common Stock to the Tendering Party pursuant to the terms of this
Section 15.1(b), in which case (1) the Initial Limited Partner shall assume
directly the obligation with respect thereto and shall satisfy the Tendering
Party's exercise of its Redemption Right with respect to such Tendered
Units and (2) such transaction shall be treated, for federal income tax
purposes, as a transfer by the Tendering Party of such Tendered Units to the
Initial Limited Partner in exchange for the Common Stock Amount. If the
General Partner so elects, on the Specified Redemption Date, the Tendering
Party shall sell such number of the Tendered Units to the Initial Limited
Partner in exchange for a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the
product of the Common Stock Amount and the Applicable Percentage. The
Tendering Party shall submit (i) such information, certification or affidavit
as the Initial Limited Partner may reasonably require in connection with the
application of the Ownership Limit to any such acquisition and (ii) such
written representations, investment letters, legal opinions or other
instruments necessary, in the Initial Limited Partner's view, to effect
compliance with the Securities Act. In the event of a purchase of the
Tendered Units by the Initial Limited Partner pursuant to this Section
15.1(b), the Tendering Party shall no longer have the right to cause the
Partnership to effect a Redemption of such Tendered Units and, upon notice
to the Tendering Party by the General Partner given on or before the close of
business on the Cut-Off Date that the General Partner has elected to require
the Initial Limited Partner to acquire some or all of the Tendered Units
pursuant to this Section 15.1(b), the obligation of the Partnership to effect
a Redemption of the Tendered Units as to which the General Partner's
notice relates shall not accrue or arise. A number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the product of the Applicable Percentage and the Common Stock
Amount, if applicable, shall be delivered by the Initial Limited Partner as
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of
Common Stock and, if applicable, Rights, free of any pledge, lien, encumbrance
or restriction, other than the Ownership Limit, the Securities Act and
relevant state securities or "blue sky" laws. Neither any Tendering Party
whose Tendered Units are acquired by the Initial Limited Partner pursuant to
this Section 15.1(b), any Partner, any Assignee nor any other interested
Person shall have any right to require or cause the Initial Limited Partner to
register, qualify or list any Common Stock owned or held by such Person,
whether or not such shares of Common Stock are issued pursuant to this
Section 15.1(b), with the SEC, with any state securities commissioner,
department or agency, under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or with
any stock exchange; _provided_ , _however_ , that this limitation shall not be
in derogation of any registration or similar rights granted pursuant to any
other written agreement between the Initial Limited Partner and any such
Person. Shares of Common Stock issued upon an acquisition of the Tendered
Units by the Initial Limited Partner pursuant to this Section 15.1(b) may
contain such legends regarding restrictions under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws as the General Partner determines to be
necessary or advisable in order to ensure compliance with such laws.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 15.1(a) and 15.1(b)
hereof, the Tendering Parties shall have no rights under this Agreement that
would otherwise be prohibited by the Articles of Incorporation and shall have
no rights to require the Partnership to redeem OP Units if the acquisition of
such OP Units by the Initial Limited Partner pursuant to Section 15.1(b)
hereof would cause any Person to violate the Ownership Limit. To the extent
that any attempted Redemption or acquisition of the Tendered Units by the
Initial Limited Partner pursuant to Section 15.1(b) hereof would be in
violation of this Section 15.1(c), it shall be null and void _ab initio_
, and the Tendering Party shall not acquire any rights or economic interests
in the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable by the Initial Limited
Partner under Section 15.1(b) hereof or cash otherwise payable under Section
15.1(a) hereof.

  



  

   

78

 



    



  

(d) If the General Partner does not elect to require the Initial
Limited Partner to acquire the Tendered Units pursuant to Section
15.1(b) hereof:

  



  

(i) The Partnership may elect to raise funds for the payment of the
Cash Amount either (a) by requiring that the Initial Limited
Partner contribute to the Partnership funds from the proceeds of a registered
public Offering by the Initial Limited Partner of shares of Common Stock
sufficient to purchase the Tendered Units or (b) from any other sources
(including, but not limited to, the sale of any Property and the incurrence
of additional Debt) available to the Partnership. The Initial Limited Partner
shall make a Capital Contribution of any such amounts to the Partnership for
an additional Partnership Interest consistent with the provisions of Article
4. Any such contribution shall entitle the Initial Limited Partner to an
equitable Percentage Interest adjustment.

  



  

(ii) If the Cash Amount is not paid on or before the Specified
Redemption Date, interest shall accrue with respect to the Cash Amount from
the day after the Specified Redemption Date to and including the date on which
the Cash Amount is paid at a rate equal to the base rate on corporate loans
at large United States money center commercial banks, as published from time
to time in the Wall Street Journal (but not higher than the maximum lawful
rate).

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (but subject to
Section 15.1(c) hereof), with respect to any Redemption (or any tender of OP
Units for Redemption if the Tendered Units are acquired by the Initial
Limited Partner pursuant to Section 15.1(b) hereof) pursuant to this Section
15.1:

  



  

(i) All OP Units acquired by the Initial Limited Partner pursuant to
Section 15.1(b) hereof shall automatically, and without further
action required, be converted into and deemed to be an Initial Limited
Partner Partnership Interest comprised of the same number of OP Units.

  



  

(ii) Subject to the Ownership Limit, no Tendering Party may effect a
Redemption for less than one thousand (1,000) OP Units or, if such
Tendering Party holds (as a Limited Partner or, economically, as an Assignee)
less than one thousand (1,000) OP Units, all of the OP Units held by such
Tendering Party, without, in each case, the Consent of the General Partner.

  



  

(iii) If (i) a Tendering Party surrenders its Tendered Units during the
period after the Partnership Record Date with respect to a distribution and
before the record date established by the Initial Limited Partner for a
distribution to its stockholders of some or all of its portion of such
Partnership distribution, and (ii) the General Partner elects to require the
Initial Limited Partner to acquire any of such Tendered Units in exchange for
shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 15.1(b), such Tendering Party shall
pay to the Initial Limited Partner on the Specified Redemption Date an amount
in cash equal to the portion of the Partnership distribution in respect of
the Tendered Units exchanged for shares of Common Stock, insofar as such
distribution relates to the same period for which such Tendering Party would
receive a distribution in respect of such shares of Common Stock.

  



  

   

79

 



    



  

(iv) The consummation of such Redemption (or an acquisition of Tendered
Units by the Initial Limited Partner pursuant to Section 15.1(b) hereof, as
the case may be) shall be subject to the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting period, if any, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

  



  

(v) The Tendering Party shall continue to own (subject, in the case of
an Assignee, to the provisions of Section 11.5 hereof) all OP Units subject
to any Redemption, and be treated as a Limited Partner or an Assignee, as
applicable, with respect to such OP Units for all purposes of this Agreement,
until such OP Units are either paid for by the Partnership pursuant to Section
15.1(a) hereof or transferred to the Initial Limited Partner and paid for, by
the issuance of the Common Stock, pursuant to Section 15.1(b) hereof on the
Specified Redemption Date. Until a Specified Redemption Date and an
acquisition of the Tendered Units by the Initial Limited Partner pursuant to
Section 15.1(b) hereof, the Tendering Party shall have no rights as a
stockholder of the Initial Limited Partner with respect to the shares of
Common Stock issuable in connection with such acquisition.

  



  

(f) In connection with an exercise of Redemption Rights pursuant to
this Section 15.1, except as otherwise Consented to by the General Partner,
the Tendering Party shall submit the following to the General Partner, in
addition to the Notice of Redemption:

  



  

(i) A written affidavit, dated the same date as the Notice of
Redemption, (a) disclosing the actual and constructive ownership, as
determined for purposes of Code Sections 856(a)(6) and 856(h), of shares of
Common Stock by (i) such Tendering Party and (ii) to the best of their
knowledge any Related Party and (b) representing that, after giving effect to
the Redemption or an acquisition of the Tendered Units by the Initial Limited
Partner pursuant to Section 15.1(b) hereof, neither the Tendering Party nor to
the best of their knowledge any Related Party will own shares of Common Stock
in violation of the Ownership Limit;

  



  

(ii) A written representation that neither the Tendering Party nor to
the best of their knowledge any Related Party has any intention to acquire
any additional shares of Common Stock prior to the closing of the Redemption
or an acquisition of the Tendered Units by the Initial Limited Partner
pursuant to Section 15.1(b) hereof on the Specified Redemption Date;

  



  

(iii) An undertaking to certify, at and as a condition of the closing
of (i) the Redemption or (ii) the acquisition of Tendered Units by the
Initial Limited Partner pursuant to Section 15.1(b) hereof on the Specified
Redemption Date, that either (a) the actual and constructive ownership of
shares of Common Stock by the Tendering Party and to the best of its knowledge
any Related Party remain unchanged from that disclosed in the affidavit
required by Section 15.1(f)(i) or (b) after giving effect to the Redemption
or the acquisition of Tendered Units by the Initial Limited Partner pursuant
to Section 15.1(b) hereof, neither the Tendering Party nor, to the best of
its knowledge, any other Person shall own shares of Common Stock in violation
of the Ownership Limit; and

  



  

   

80

 



    



  

(iv) In connection with any Special Redemption, the Initial Limited
Partner shall have the right to receive an opinion of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to it to the effect that the proposed Special
Redemption will not cause the Partnership, the General Partner or the Initial
Limited Partner to violate any federal or state securities laws or regulations
applicable to the Special Redemption, the issuance and sale of the Tendered
Units to the Tendering Party or the issuance and sale of Shares of Common
Stock to the Tendering Party pursuant to Section 15.1(b) of this Agreement.

  



  

(g) The Qualifying Party shall be solely responsible for the payment of
any real estate transfer taxes imposed in connection with any Redemption.

Stockholders for the election of directors of the Initial Limited Partner or

   | 15.14| _Limitation  to Preserve REIT Status_. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, to the extent that the
amount to be paid, credited, distributed or reimbursed by the Partnership to
the Initial Limited Partner or its officers, directors, employees or agents,
whether as a reimbursement, fee, expense or indemnity (a " _REIT Payment_ "),
would constitute gross income to the Initial Limited Partner for purposes of
Section 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code, then, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the amount of such REIT Payments, as selected by
the General Partner in its discretion from among items of potential
distribution, reimbursement, fees, expenses and indemnities, shall be reduced
for any Partnership Year so that the REIT Payments, as so reduced, for or with
respect to the Initial Limited Partner shall not exceed the lesser of:

  



  

   

82

 



    



  

(i)  an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) four and nine-tenths
percent (4.9%) of the Initial Limited Partner's total gross income (but
excluding the amount of any REIT Payments) for the Partnership Year that is
described in subsections (A) through (I) of Section 856(c)(2) of the Code
over (b) the amount of gross income (within the meaning of Section 856(c)(2)
of the Code) derived by the Initial Limited Partner from sources other than
those described in subsections (A) through (I) of Section 856(c)(2) of the
Code (but not including the amount of any REIT Payments); or

  



  

(ii)  an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) twenty-four percent
(24%) of the Initial Limited Partner's total gross income (but excluding the
amount of any REIT Payments) for the Partnership Year that is described in
subsections (A) through (I) of Section 856(c)(3) of the Code over (b) the
amount of gross income (within the meaning of Section 856(c)(3) of the Code)
derived by the Initial Limited Partner from sources other than those
described in subsections (A) through (I) of Section 856(c)(3) of the
Code (but not including the amount of any REIT Payments);

  



  

 _provided_ ,  _however_ , that REIT Payments in excess of the amounts set
forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above may be made if the General Partner, as a
condition precedent, obtains an opinion of tax counsel that the receipt of
such excess amounts should not adversely affect the Initial Limited Partner's
ability to qualify as a REIT. To the extent that REIT Payments may not be made
in a Partnership Year as a consequence of the limitations set forth in this
Section 15.14, such REIT Payments shall carry over and shall be treated as
arising in the following Partnership Year if such carry over does not
adversely affect the Initial Limited Partner's ability to qualify as a REIT,
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such REIT Payment shall not be carried over
more than three Partnership Years, and any such remaining payments shall no
longer be due and payable. The purpose of the limitations contained in this
Section 15.14 is to prevent the Initial Limited Partner from failing to
qualify as a REIT under the Code by reason of the Initial Limited Partner's
share of items, including distributions, reimbursements, fees, expenses or
indemnities, receivable directly or indirectly from the Partnership, and this
Section 15.14 shall be interpreted and applied to effectuate such purpose.

  



  

Article 16 
 CLASS B UNITS

  



   | 16.1| _Designation  and Number_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) Except as set forth in this Article 16, Class B Units shall have
the same rights, privileges and preferences as the OP Units. Subject to the
provisions of this Article 16 and the special provisions of subparagraph
1(c)(ii) of Exhibit A, Class B Units shall be treated as Partnership Units,
with all of the rights, privileges and obligations attendant thereto.

  



  

   

83

 



    



  

(b) It is intended that the Partnership shall maintain at all times a
one-to-one correspondence between Class B Units and OP Units for conversion
and other purposes. If an Adjustment Event (as defined below) occurs, then the
General Partner shall make a corresponding adjustment to the Class B Units to
maintain a one-for-one conversion and economic equivalence ratio between OP
Units and Class B Units. The following shall be " _Adjustment Events_ :" (A)
the Partnership makes a distribution on all outstanding OP Units in
Partnership Units, (B) the Partnership subdivides the outstanding OP Units
into a greater number of units or combines the outstanding OP Units into a
smaller number of units, or (C) the Partnership issues any Partnership Units
in exchange for its outstanding OP Units by way of a reclassification or
recapitalization of its OP Units. If more than one Adjustment Event
occurs, the adjustment to the Class B Units need be made only once using a
single formula that takes into account each and every Adjustment Event as if
all Adjustment Events occurred simultaneously. For the avoidance of doubt, the
following events shall not be Adjustment Events: (x) the issuance of
Partnership Units in a financing, reorganization, acquisition or other similar
business transaction, (y) the issuance of Partnership Units pursuant to any
employee benefit or compensation plan or dividend reinvestment plan, or (z)
the issuance of any Partnership Units in respect of a capital contribution to
the Partnership, including a contribution by the Initial Limited Partner of
proceeds from the sale of securities by the Initial Limited Partner. If the
Partnership takes an action affecting the OP Units other than actions
specifically described above as Adjustment Events and, in the opinion of
the General Partner such action would require an adjustment to the Class B
Units to maintain the one-to-one correspondence described above, the General
Partner shall have the right to make such adjustment to the Class B Units, to
the extent permitted by law, in such manner and at such time as the General
Partner, in its sole discretion, may determine to be appropriate under the
circumstances. If an adjustment is made to the Class B Units as herein
provided, the Partnership shall promptly file in the books and records of the
Partnership an officer's certificate setting forth such adjustment and a brief
statement of the facts requiring such adjustment, which certificate shall be
conclusive evidence of the correctness of such adjustment absent manifest
error. Promptly after the filing of such certificate, the Partnership shall
mail a notice to each holder of Class B Units setting forth the adjustment to
his, her or its Class B Units and the effective date of such adjustment.

  



   | 16.2| _Special  Provisions_. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Class B Units shall be subject to the following special provisions:

  



  

(a) _Distributions_. The holders of Class B Units shall be entitled to
(i) current distributions of Available Cash pursuant to Section 5.1(a);
and (ii) distributions in liquidation of the Partnership pursuant to Section
13.2.

  



  

(b) _Allocations_. Holders of Class B Units shall be entitled to
certain special allocations of gain under subparagraph 1(c)(ii) of _Exhibit
A_.

  



  

(c) _Exchange Right_. The right to exchange all or a portion of
Partnership Units for cash or, at the option of the Partnership, for
shares of Common Stock provided to Limited Partners under Section 15.1 hereof
shall not apply with respect to Class B Units unless and until the Class B
Units are converted to OP Units as provided in clause (d) below and Section
16.4 hereof.

  



  

   

84

 



    



  

(d) _Conversion to OP Units_. Class B Units are eligible to be
converted into OP Units in accordance with Section 16.4 hereof.

  



   | 16.3| _Voting_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) Holders of Class B Units shall (a) have the same voting rights as
the Limited Partners, with the Class B Units voting as a single class with
the OP Units and having one vote per Class B Unit; and (b) have the additional
voting rights that are expressly set forth below. So long as any Class B
Units remain outstanding, the Partnership shall not, without the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least a majority of the Class B Units outstanding
at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a
meeting (voting separately as a class), amend, alter or repeal, whether by
merger, consolidation or otherwise, the provisions of this Agreement
applicable to Class B Units so as to materially and adversely affect any
right, privilege or voting power of the Class B Units or the holders of Class
B Units as such, unless such amendment, alteration, or repeal affects equally,
ratably and proportionately the rights, privileges and voting powers of the
Limited Partners; but subject, in any event, to the following provisions:

  



  

(i) With respect to any OP Unit Transaction, so long as the Class B
Units are treated in accordance with Section 16.4(d) hereof, the
consummation of such OP Unit Transaction shall not be deemed to materially
and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of
the Class B Units or the holders of Class B Units as such; and

  



  

(ii) Any creation or issuance of any Partnership Units or of any class
or series of Partnership Interest including additional OP Units or Class B
Units whether ranking senior to, junior to, or on a parity with the Class B
Units with respect to distributions and the distribution of assets upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and
adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the
Class B Units or the holders of Class B Units as such.

  



  

(b) The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to
the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be
required, all outstanding Class B Units shall have been converted into OP
Units.

  



   | 16.4| _Conversion  of Class B Units_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) _Conversion_. At such time as the Economic Capital Account Balance
attributable to a Class B Unit is equal to the OP Unit Economic Balance, each
such balance determined on a per unit basis as of the effective date of
conversion (the " _Conversion Date_ "), such Class B Unit shall automatically
convert into one fully paid and non-assessable OP Unit, giving effect to all
adjustments (if any) made pursuant to Section 16.1 hereof; _provided_ , that
a Class B Unit shall not be convertible into OP Units if the Economic Capital
Account Balance attributable to such Class B Unit is negative. Each holder of
Class B Units covenants and agrees with the Partnership that all Class B
Units to be converted pursuant to this Section 16.4 shall be free and clear of
all liens. The conversion of Class B Units shall occur automatically after
the close of business on the applicable Conversion Date without any action on
the part of such holder of Class B Units, as of which time such holder of
Class B Units shall be credited on the books and records of the Partnership
with the issuance as of the opening of business on the next day of the number
of OP Units issuable upon such conversion. For purposes of determining the
Economic Capital Account Balance attributable to a Class B Unit, allocations
pursuant to subparagraph 1(c)(ii) of _Exhibit A_ shall be made in such a
manner so as to allow the greatest number of Class B Units to convert
pursuant to this Section 16.4 at any time.

  



  

   

85

 



    



  

(b) _Adjustment to Gross Asset Value_.

  



  

(i) The General Partner shall provide the holders of Class B Units the
opportunity but not the obligation to make Capital Contributions to the
Partnership in exchange for OP Units in order to cause an adjustment to the
Gross Asset Value of the Partnership's assets within the meaning of paragraph
(b)(i) of the definition of Gross Asset Value up to two (2) times each
Partnership Year including:

  



  

(A) if the Partnership or the General Partner shall be a party to any
OP Unit Transaction; _provided_ , that the General Partner shall give each
holder of Class B Units written notice of such OP Unit Transaction at least
thirty (30) days prior to entering into any definitive agreement pursuant to
which the OP Unit Transaction would be consummated; or

  



  

(B) upon a Listing; _provided_ , that the General Partner shall give
each holder of Class B Units written notice of such Listing at least thirty
(30) days prior to such Listing.

  



  

(ii) For purposes of clause (i) of this Section 16.4(b), the value of
each OP Unit issued in order to cause an adjustment to the Gross Asset Value
of the Partnership's assets shall be an amount equal to the product of (y) the
Value of a share of Common Stock as of the date the holder of Class B Units
makes a Capital Contribution to the Partnership multiplied by (z) the Exchange
Factor.

  



  

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, the issuance of Class B Units shall
be treated as an event allowing for an adjustment to the Gross Asset Value of
the Partnership's assets within the meaning of paragraph (b)(iv) of the
definition of Gross Asset Value.

  



  

(c) _Impact of Conversion for Purposes of Subparagraph 1(c)(ii) of
Exhibit A_. For purposes of making future allocations under
subparagraph 1(c)(ii) of _Exhibit A_ , the portion of the Economic Capital
Account Balance of the applicable holder of Class B Units that is treated as
attributable to his, her or its Class B Units shall be reduced, as of the date
of conversion, by the product of the number of Class B Units converted and
the OP Unit Economic Balance.

  



  

   

86

 



    



  

(d) _OP Unit Transactions_. Immediately prior to or concurrent with an
OP Unit Transaction the maximum number of Class B Units then eligible for
conversion (in accordance with the provisions of Section 16.4(a)) shall
automatically be converted into an equal number of OP Units, giving effect to
all adjustments (if any) made pursuant to Section 16.1 hereof, taking into
account any allocations that occur in connection with the OP Unit Transaction
or that would occur in connection with the OP Unit Transaction if the
assets of the Partnership were sold at the OP Unit Transaction price or, if
applicable, at a value determined by the General Partner in good faith using
the value attributed to the Partnership Units in the context of the OP Unit
Transaction (in which case the Conversion Date shall be the effective date of
the OP Unit Transaction). In anticipation of such OP Unit Transaction, the
Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each holder of
Class B Units to be afforded the right to receive in connection with such OP
Unit Transaction in consideration for the OP Units into which his, her or its
Class B Units will be converted the same kind and amount of cash, securities
and other property (or any combination thereof) receivable upon the
consummation of such OP Unit Transaction by a holder of the same number of OP
Units, assuming such holder of OP Units is not a Person with which
the Partnership consolidated or into which the Partnership merged or which
merged into the Partnership or to which such sale or transfer was made, as
the case may be (a " _Constituent Person_ "), or an affiliate of a Constituent
Person. In the event that holders of OP Units have the opportunity to elect
the form or type of consideration to be received upon consummation of the OP
Unit Transaction, prior to such OP Unit Transaction the General Partner shall
give prompt written notice to each holder of Class B Units of such election,
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to afford the holders of Class B
Units the right to elect, by written notice to the General Partner, the form
or type of consideration to be received upon conversion of each Class B Unit
held by such holder into OP Units in connection with such OP Unit Transaction.
If a holder of Class B Units fails to make such an election, such holder (and
any of its transferees) shall receive upon conversion of each Class B Unit
held by him, her or it (or by any of his, her or its transferees) the same
kind and amount of consideration that a holder of an OP Unit would receive if
such OP Unit holder failed to make such an election. The Partnership shall use
commercially reasonable effort to cause the terms of any OP Unit Transaction
to be consistent with the provisions of this Section 16.4(d) and to enter into
an agreement with the successor or purchasing entity, as the case may be, for
the benefit of any holders of Class B Units whose Class B Units will not be
converted into OP Units in connection with the OP Unit Transaction that will
(i) contain provisions enabling the holders of Class B Units that remain
outstanding after such OP Unit Transaction to convert their Class B Units into
securities as comparable as reasonably possible under the circumstances to
the OP Units and (ii) preserve as far as reasonably possible under the
circumstances the distribution, special allocation, conversion, and other
rights set forth in this Agreement for the benefit of the holders of Class B
Units.

  



   | 16.5| _Profits  Interests_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) Class B Units are intended to qualify as a "profits interest" in
the Partnership issued to a new or existing Partner in a partner capacity for
services performed or to be performed to or for the benefit of the Partnership
within the meaning of Rev. Proc. 93-27, 1993-2 C.B. 343, and Rev. Proc.
2001-43, 2001-2 C.B. 191, the Code, the Regulations, and other future guidance
provided by the IRS with respect thereto, and the allocations under
subparagraph 1(c)(ii) of _Exhibit A_ shall be interpreted in a manner that is
consistent therewith.

  



  

(b) The Partners agree that the General Partner may make a Safe Harbor
Election (if and when the Safe Harbor Election becomes available), on behalf
of itself and of all Partners, to have the Safe Harbor apply irrevocably with
respect to Class B Units transferred in connection with the performance of
services by a Partner in a partner capacity. The Safe Harbor Election (if and
when the Safe Harbor Election becomes available) shall be effective as of the
date of issuance of such Class B Units. If such election is made, (i) the
Partnership and each Partner agree to comply with all requirements of the Safe
Harbor with respect to all interests in the Partnership transferred in
connection with the performance of services by a Partner in a partner
capacity, whether such Partner was admitted as a Partner or as the transferee
of a previous Partner, and (ii) the General Partner shall cause the
Partnership to comply with all record-keeping requirements and other
administrative requirements with respect to the Safe Harbor as shall be
required by proposed or final regulations relating thereto.

  



  

   

87

 



    



  

(c) The Partners agree that if a Safe Harbor Election is made by the
General Partner, (A) each Class B Unit issued hereunder with respect to which
the Safe Harbor Election is available is a Safe Harbor Interest, (B) each
Class B Unit represents a profits interest received for services rendered or
to be rendered to or for the benefit of the Partnership by such holder of
Class B Units in his, her or its capacity as a Partner or in anticipation of
becoming a Partner, and (C) the fair market value of each Class B Unit issued
by the Partnership upon receipt by such holder of Class B Units as of the date
of issuance is zero (plus the amount, if any, of any Capital Contributions
made to the Partnership by such holder of Class B Units in connection with the
issuance of such Class B Unit), representing the liquidation value of such
interest upon receipt (with such valuation being consented to and
hereby approved by all Partners).

  



  

(d) Each Partner, by signing this Agreement or by accepting such
transfer, hereby agrees (A) to comply with all requirements of any
Safe Harbor Election made by the General Partner with respect to each holder
of Class B Units' Safe Harbor Interest, (B) that each holder of Class B Units
shall take into account all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit
associated with its Class B Units, (C) that neither the Partnership nor any
Partner shall claim a deduction (as wages, compensation or otherwise) for the
fair market value of such Class B Units issued to a holder of such Class B
Units, and (D) that to the extent that such profits interest is forfeited
after the date hereof, the Partnership shall make special forfeiture
allocations of gross items of income, deduction or loss (including, as may be
permitted by or under Regulations (or other rules promulgated) to be
adopted, notional items of income, deduction or loss) in accordance with the
Regulations to be adopted under Sections 704(b) and 83 of the Code.

  



  

(e) The General Partner shall file or cause the Partnership to file all
returns, reports and other documentation as may be required, as reasonably
determined by the General Partner, to perfect and maintain any Safe Harbor
Election made by the General Partner with respect to granting of each holder
of Class B Units' Safe Harbor Interest.

  



  

(f) The General Partner is hereby authorized and empowered, without
further vote or action of the Partners, to amend this Agreement to the extent
necessary or helpful in accordance with the advice of Partnership tax counsel
or accountants to sustain the Partnership's position that (A) it has complied
with the Safe Harbor requirements in order to provide for a Safe Harbor
Election and it has ability to maintain the same, or (B) the issuance of the
Class B Units is not a taxable event with respect to the holders of Class B
Units, and the General Partner shall have the authority to execute any such
amendment by and on behalf of each Partner pursuant to the power of attorney
granted by this Agreement. Any undertaking by any Partner necessary or
desirable to (A) enable or preserve a Safe Harbor Election or (B) otherwise
to prevent the issuance of Class B Units from being a taxable event with
respect to the holders of Class B Units may be reflected in such amendments
and, to the extent so reflected, shall be binding on each Partner.

  



  

   

88

 



    



  

(g) Each Partner agrees to cooperate with the General Partner to
perfect and maintain any Safe Harbor Election, and to timely execute
and deliver any documentation with respect thereto reasonably requested by
the General Partner, at the expense of the Partnership.

  



  

(h) No Transfer of any interest in the Partnership by a Partner shall
be effective unless prior to such Transfer, the assignee or
intended recipient of such interest shall have agreed in writing to be bound
by the provisions of Section 10.2(d) and this Section 16.5, in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the General Partner.

  



  

(i) The provisions of this Section 16.5 shall apply regardless of
whether or not a holder of Class B Units files an election pursuant to
Section 83(b) of the Code.

  



  

(j) The General Partner may amend this Section 16.5 as it deems
necessary or appropriate to maximize the tax benefit of the issuance of Class
B Units to any holder of Class B Units if there are changes in the law or
Regulations concerning the issuance of partnership interests for services.

Allocations

  



  

1. _Allocations_.

  



  

(a) _[Intentionally omitted.]_

  



  

(b) _Allocations of Net Income and Net Loss_. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, after giving effect to the special allocations in
subparagraphs 1(c) and paragraph 2, Net Income, Net Loss and, to the extent
necessary, individual items of income, gain, credit, loss and deduction
comprising Net Income and Net Loss of the Partnership for each Partnership
Year or other applicable period shall be allocated among the Partners in a
manner determined in the reasonable discretion of the General Partner that
will, as nearly as possible cause the Capital Account balance of each Partner
at the end of such Partnership Year or other applicable period to equal (i)
the amount of the distributions that would be made to such Partner pursuant to
Section 5.1(a) of the Agreement if the Partnership were dissolved, its
affairs wound up and its assets were sold for cash equal to their Gross Asset
Value, taking into account any adjustments thereto for such period, all
Partnership liabilities were satisfied in full in cash according to their
terms (limited with respect to each nonrecourse liability to the Gross Asset
Value of the assets securing such liability), and the net proceeds (after
satisfaction of such liabilities) were distributed in full in accordance with
Section 5.1(a) of the Agreement to the Partners immediately after making such
allocations, minus (ii) the sum of such Partner's share of
Partnership Minimum Gain and Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain and the
amount, if any and without duplication, that the Partner would be obligated
to contribute to the capital of the Partnership, all computed immediately
prior to the hypothetical sale of assets.

  



  

(c) _Special Allocations_.

  



  

(i) _General Partner Gross Income Allocation._ After giving effect
to the special allocations in paragraph 2 but prior to any allocations under
subparagraph 1(b), there shall be specially allocated to the General Partner
an amount of (i) first, items of Partnership income and (ii) second, items of
Partnership gain during each Partnership Year or other applicable period in an
amount equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the cumulative distributions made
to the General Partner under Section 7.3(b) of the Agreement, other than
distributions which would properly be treated as "guaranteed payments" or
which are attributable to the reimbursement of expenses which would properly
be either deductible by the Partnership or added to the tax basis of any
Partnership asset, over (B) the cumulative allocations of Partnership income
and gain to the General Partner under this subparagraph 1(c)(i).

  



  

   

A-1

 



    



  

(ii) _Special Allocations Regarding Class B Units_. After giving
effect to the special allocations in subparagraph 1(c)(i) and paragraph 2 but
prior to any allocations under subparagraph 1(b), Net Property Gain, Net
Property Loss or Liquidating Gain and, to the extent necessary, individual
items of income and gain comprising Net Property Gain and Liquidating Gain of
the Partnership shall be allocated to the holders of Class B Units until
their Economic Capital Account Balances are equal to (A) the OP Unit Economic
Balance, multiplied by (B) the number of their Class B Units; _provided_ ,
that no such Net Property Gain, Net Property Loss or Liquidating Gain or
individual items of income and gain comprising Net Property Gain or
Liquidating Gain will be allocated with respect to any particular Class B
Unit unless and to the extent that the OP Unit Economic Balance exceeds the OP
Unit Economic Balance in existence at the time such Class B Unit was issued.
The "Economic Capital Account Balances" of the Class B Unit holders will be
equal to their Capital Account balances to the extent attributable to their
ownership of Class B Units. The "OP Unit Economic Balance" shall mean (Y) the
aggregate Capital Account balance attributable to the OP Units outstanding,
plus the amount of any Partner Minimum Gain or Partnership Minimum Gain, in
either case to the extent attributable to the ownership of OP Units and
computed on a hypothetical basis after taking into account all allocations
through the date on which any allocation is made under this subparagraph
1(c)(ii), divided by (Z) the number of OP Units outstanding. Any allocations
made pursuant to the first sentence of this subparagraph 1(c)(ii) shall be
made among the holders of Class B Units in proportion to the amounts required
to be allocated to each under this subparagraph 1(c)(ii). The parties agree
that the intent of this subparagraph 1(c)(ii) is to make the Capital Account
balance associated with each Class B Unit to be economically equivalent to the
Capital Account balance associated with the OP Units outstanding (on a per-
Unit basis), but only if and to the extent that the Capital Account balance
associated with the OP Units outstanding, without regard to the allocations
under this subparagraph 1(c)(ii), has increased on a per-Unit basis since the
issuance of the relevant Class B Unit. Any remaining Net Property Gain, Net
Property Loss or Liquidating Gain not allocated pursuant to this subparagraph
1(c)(ii) shall be included in the calculation of Net Income and Net Loss
and will be allocated pursuant to subparagraph 1(b).

  



  

2. _Regulatory Allocations_. Notwithstanding any provisions of paragraph 1 of this _Exhibit A_ , the following special allocations shall be made.

  



  

(a) _Minimum Gain Chargeback (Nonrecourse Liabilities)_. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 1.704-2(f) of the Regulations, if there is a
net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain for any Partnership Year, each
Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for
such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to such
Partner's share of the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain to the extent
required by Section 1.704-2(f) of the Regulations. The items to be so
allocated shall be determined in accordance with Sections 1.704-2(f) and (i)
of the Regulations. This subparagraph 2(a) is intended to comply with the
minimum gain chargeback requirement in said section of the Regulations and
shall be interpreted consistently therewith. Allocations pursuant to this
subparagraph 2(a) shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts
required to be allocated to each Partner pursuant hereto.

  



  

   

A-2

 



    



  

(b) _Partner Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Except as otherwise provided
in Section 1.704-2(i)(4) of the Regulations, if there is a net decrease in
Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any Partnership Year, each
Partner who has a share of the Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain,
determined in accordance with Section 1.704-2(i)(5) of the Regulations, shall
be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year
(and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to that
Partner's share of the net decrease in the Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum
Gain to the extent and in the manner required by Section 1.704-2(i) of the
Regulations. The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance
with Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and (j)(2) of the Regulations. This subparagraph
2(b) is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement with
respect to Partner Nonrecourse Debt contained in said section of the
Regulations and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. Allocations
pursuant to this subparagraph 2(b) shall be made in proportion to the
respective amounts required to be allocated to each Partner pursuant hereto.

  



  

(c) _Qualified Income Offset_. If a Partner unexpectedly receives
any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Sections
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6) of the Regulations, and such Partner has
an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, items of Partnership income
(including gross income) and gain shall be specially allocated to such
Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate the Adjusted Capital
Account Deficit as quickly as possible as required by the Regulations. This
subparagraph 2(c) is intended to constitute a "qualified income offset" under
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) of the Regulations and shall be interpreted
consistently therewith.

  



  

(d) _Nonrecourse Deductions_. Nonrecourse Deductions for any
Partnership Year or other applicable period shall be allocated to the
Partners in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.

  



  

(e) _Partner Nonrecourse Deductions_. Partner Nonrecourse
Deductions for any Partnership Year or other applicable period with respect
to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt shall be specially allocated to the Partner
that bears the economic risk of loss for such Partner Nonrecourse Debt (as
determined under Sections 1.704-2(b)(4) and 1.704-2(i)(1) of the Regulations).

  



  

(f) _Section 754 Adjustment_. To the extent an adjustment to the
adjusted tax basis of any asset of the Partnership pursuant to Section 734(b)
of the Code or Section 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m) of the Regulations, to be taken into account in
determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital
Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the
basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis) and
such gain or loss shall be specially allocated among the Partners in a manner
consistent with the manner in which each of their respective Capital Accounts
are required to be adjusted pursuant to such section of the Regulations.

  



  

(g) _Gross Income Allocation_. If any Partner has an Adjusted
Capital Account Deficit at the end of any Partnership Year or other
applicable period which is in excess of the amount such Partner is obligated
to restore pursuant to the penultimate sentences of Sections 1.704-2(g)(1)
and 1.704-2(i)(5) of the Regulations, such Partner shall be specially
allocated items of Partnership income (including gross income) and gain in
the amount of such excess as quickly as possible, provided that an allocation
pursuant to this subparagraph 2(g) shall be made if and only to the extent
that such Partner would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit in excess of
such amount after all other allocations provided for under this Agreement
have been tentatively made as if subparagraph 2(c) and this subparagraph 2(g)
were not in this Agreement.

  



  

   

A-3

 



    



  

3. _Curative Allocations_. The General Partner is authorized to offset all Regulatory Allocations either with other Regulatory Allocations or with special allocations of other items of Partnership income, gain, loss, or deduction pursuant to this paragraph 3. Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of this _Exhibit A_ (other than the Regulatory Allocations and Tax Allocations), the General Partner shall make such offsetting allocations of Partnership income, gain, loss or deduction in whatever manner the General Partner determines appropriate so that, after such offsetting allocations are made, each Partner's Capital Account balance is, to the extent possible, equal to the Capital Account balance such Partner would have had if the Regulatory Allocations were not part of this Agreement.

  



  

4. _Tax Allocations_.

  



  

(a) _Items of Income or Loss_. Except as is otherwise provided in
this Exhibit A, an allocation of Partnership Net Income, Net Loss,
Net Property Gain, Net Property Loss or Liquidating Gain to a Partner shall
be treated as an allocation to such Partner of the same share of each item of
income, gain, loss, deduction and item of tax-exempt income or Section
705(a)(2)(B) expenditure (or item treated as such expenditure pursuant to
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(i) of the Regulations) that is taken into account in
computing Net Income, Net Loss, Net Property Gain, Net Property Loss or
Liquidating Gain. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph 4, items of
income, gain, loss and deduction of the Partnership to be allocated for income
tax purposes (" _Tax Items_ ") shall be allocated among the Partners on the
same basis as the corresponding book items are allocated under paragraphs 1
through 3 of this _Exhibit A_.

  



  

(b) _Section 1245/1250 Recapture_. Subject to subparagraph 4(c)
below, if any portion of gain from the sale of Partnership assets is
treated as gain which is ordinary income by virtue of the application of
Sections 1245 or 1250 of the Code or is gain described in Section 1(h)(1)(D)
of the Code (" _Affected Gain_ "), then such Affected Gain shall be allocated
among the Partners in the same proportion that the depreciation and
amortization deductions giving rise to the Affected Gain were allocated. This
subparagraph 4(b) shall not alter the amount of Net Income, Net Property Gain
or Liquidating Gain (or items thereof) allocated among the Partners, but
merely the character of such Net Income, Net Property Gain or Liquidating Gain
(or items thereof). For purposes hereof, in order to determine the
proportionate allocations of depreciation and amortization deductions for each
Partnership Year or other applicable period, such deductions shall be deemed
allocated on the same basis as Net Income, Net Loss, Net Property Gain,
Net Property Loss and Liquidating Gain for such respective period.

  



  

(c) _Precontribution Gain, Revaluations_. With respect to any
Contributed Property, the Partnership shall use any permissible method
contained in the Regulations promulgated under Section 704(c) of the Code
selected by the General Partner, in its sole discretion, to take into account
any variation between the adjusted basis of such asset and the fair market
value of such asset as of the time of the contribution (" _Precontribution
Gain_ "). Each Partner hereby agrees to report income, gain, loss and
deduction on such Partner's federal income tax return in a manner consistent
with the method used by the Partnership. If any asset has a Gross Asset Value
which is different from the Partnership's adjusted basis for such asset for
federal income tax purposes because the Partnership has revalued such asset
pursuant to Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) of the Regulations, the allocations
of Tax Items shall be made in accordance with the principles of Section
704(c) of the Code and the Regulations and the methods of allocation
promulgated thereunder. The intent of this subparagraph 4(c) is that each
Partner who contributed to the capital of the Partnership a Contributed
Property will bear, through reduced allocations of depreciation, increased
allocations of gain or other items, the tax detriments associated with any
Precontribution Gain. This subparagraph 4(c) is to be interpreted
consistently with such intent.

  



  

   

A-4

 



    



  

(d) _Excess Nonrecourse Liability Safe Harbor_. Pursuant to Section
1.752-3(a)(3) of the Regulations, solely for purposes of determining each
Partner's proportionate share of the "excess nonrecourse liabilities" of the
Partnership (as defined in Section 1.752-3(a)(3) of the Regulations), the
Partners' respective interests in Partnership profits shall be
determined under any permissible method reasonably determined by the General
Partner.

  



  

(e) _References to Regulations_. Any reference in this _Exhibit A_
or the Agreement to a provision of proposed and/or temporary
Regulations shall, if such provision is modified or renumbered, be deemed to
refer to the successor provision as so modified or renumbered, but only to
the extent such successor provision applies to the Partnership under the
effective date rules applicable to such successor provision.

  



  

(f) _Successor Partners_. For purposes of this _Exhibit A_ , a
transferee of a Partnership Interest shall be deemed to have been
allocated the Net Income, Net Loss, Net Property Gain, Net Property Loss and
other items of Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction and credit allocable
to the transferred Partnership Interest that previously have been allocated to
the transferor Partner pursuant to this Agreement.

 _Exhibit B_

  



  

Examples Regarding Exchange Factor

  



  

For purposes of the following examples, it is assumed that (a) the Exchange
Factor in effect on ________ is 1.0 and (b) on _______ (the " _Partnership
Record Date_ " for purposes of these examples), prior to the events described
in the examples, there are 100 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding.

  



  

 _Example 1_

  



  

On the Partnership Record Date, the Initial Limited Partner declares a
dividend on its outstanding Common Stock in shares of Common Stock. The
amount of the dividend is one share of Common Stock paid in respect of each
share of Common Stock owned. Pursuant to Paragraph (i) of the definition of
"Exchange Factor," the Exchange Factor shall be adjusted on the Partnership
Record Date, effective immediately after the stock dividend is declared, as
follows:

  



  

1.0 * 200/100 = 2.0

  



  

Accordingly, the Exchange Factor after the stock dividend is declared is 2.0.

  



  

 _Example 2_

  



  

On the Partnership Record Date, the Initial Limited Partner distributes
options to purchase Common Stock to all holders of its Common Stock. The
amount of the distribution is one option to acquire one share of Common Stock
in respect of each share of Common Stock owned. The strike price is $4.00 a
share. The Value of a share of Common Stock on the Partnership Record Date is
$5.00 per share. Pursuant to Paragraph (ii) of the definition of "Exchange
Factor," the Exchange Factor shall be adjusted on the Partnership Record
Date, effective immediately after the options are distributed, as follows:

  



  

1.0 * (100 + 100)/(100 + [100 * $4.00/$5.00]) = 1.1111

  



  

Accordingly, the Exchange Factor after the options are distributed is 1.1111.
If the options expire or become no longer exercisable, then the retroactive
adjustment specified in Paragraph (ii) of the definition of "Exchange Factor"
shall apply.

 _Example 3_

  



  

On the Partnership Record Date, the Initial Limited Partner distributes
assets to all holders of its Common Stock. The amount of the distribution is
one asset with a fair market value (as determined by the Initial Limited
Partner) of $1.00 in respect of each share of Common Stock owned. It is also
assumed that the assets do not relate to assets received by the Initial
Limited Partner pursuant to a pro rata distribution by the Partnership. The
Value of a share of Common Stock on the Partnership Record Date is $5.00 a
share. Pursuant to Paragraph (iii) of the definition of "Exchange Factor," the
Exchange Factor shall be adjusted on the Partnership Record Date, effective
immediately after the assets are distributed, as follows:

  



  

1.0 * $5.00/($5.00 - $1.00) = 1.25

  



  

Accordingly, the Exchange Factor after the assets are distributed is 1.25.

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

  



  

Section 2.01. _PLACE_. All meetings of stockholders shall be held at
the principal executive office of the Corporation or at such other place as
shall be set by the board of directors and stated in the notice of the
meeting.

  



  

Section 2.02. _ANNUAL MEETING_. An annual meeting of the

Section 2.03. _SPECIAL MEETINGS_. Special meetings of the
stockholders may be called by: (i) the president; (ii) the chief
executive officer; (iii) the board of directors or (iv) a majority of the
Independent Directors, as defined in the Corporation's charter (the
"Charter"), and must be called by the secretary of the Corporation upon the
written request of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes
entitled to be cast at such meeting whereby such written request states the
purpose of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted upon at such
meeting. In the event of a stockholders' meeting called by the secretary as
required above, the secretary of the Corporation shall, within ten days of his
or her receipt of the written request, notify, in the manner proscribed
herein, each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, such meeting shall be held not less than 15
days nor more than 60 days after the secretary's delivery of such
notice. Subject to the foregoing sentence, such meeting shall be held at the
time and place specified in the stockholder request; provided, however, that
if none is so specified, the meeting shall be held at such time and place
convenient to the stockholders. Unless requested by the stockholders entitled
to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting, a
special meeting need not be called to consider any matter that is

stockholders held during the preceding twelve months.

  



  

   



 



    



  

Section 2.04. _NOTICE FOR MEETINGS_. Except as provided otherwise in
Section 2.03 of this Article II, the secretary shall, not less than ten nor

entitled to notice of the meeting, notice in writing or by electronic
transmission stating the time and place of the meeting and, in the case of a
special meeting or as otherwise required by the Maryland General Corporation
Law (the "MGCL"), the purpose of the meeting. Notice shall be deemed
delivered to a stockholder upon being: (i) personally delivered to the
stockholder; (ii) left at the stockholder's residence or usual place of
business; (iii) mailed to the stockholder at the stockholder's address as it
appears on the records of the Corporation, in which case such notice shall be
deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail with postage
prepaid thereon; or (iv) transmitted to the stockholder by electronic mail to
any electronic mail address of the stockholder or by any other electronic
means. A single notice to all stockholders who share an address shall be
effective as to any stockholder at such address who consents to such notice or
after having been notified of the Corporation's intent to give a single
notice fails to object in writing to such single notice within 60 days.
Failure to give notice of any meeting to one or more stockholders, or any
irregularity in such notice, shall not affect the validity of any meeting
fixed in accordance with this Article II, or the validity of any proceedings
at any such meeting. The Corporation may postpone or cancel a meeting of
stockholders by making a public announcement (as defined in Section
2.12(c)(3)) of such postponement or cancellation prior to the meeting. Notice
of the date to which the meeting is postponed shall be given not less than ten
days prior to such date and otherwise in the manner set forth in this Section
2.04.

designated in the notice, except as otherwise set forth in Section 2.12(a) of

any other relevant statute to be stated in such notice. No business shall be
transacted at a special meeting of stockholders except as specifically
designated in the notice.

Section 2.06. _ORGANIZATION AND CONDUCT_. Every meeting of
stockholders shall be conducted by an individual appointed by the board of
directors to be chairman of the meeting or, in the absence of such
appointment, by the chairman or co-chairmen of the board, as applicable, or,
in the case of a vacancy in the office or absence of the chairman of the
board, by one of the following officers present at the meeting: the vice
chairman of the board, if there be one, the president, the vice presidents in
their order of rank and seniority, the secretary, or, in the absence of such
officers, a chairman chosen by the stockholders by the vote of a majority of
the votes cast by stockholders present in person or by proxy. The secretary,
or, in the secretary's absence or the secretary's appointment as chairman of
the meeting, an assistant secretary, or in the absence of both the
secretary and assistant secretaries, an individual appointed by the board of
directors or, in the absence of such appointment, an individual appointed by
the chairman or co-chairmen of the meeting, as applicable, shall act as
secretary. In the event that the secretary presides at a meeting of the
stockholders, an assistant secretary, or, in the absence of an assistant
secretary, an individual appointed by the secretary shall record the minutes
of the meeting. The order of business and all other matters of procedure
at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined by the chairman or co-
chairmen of the meeting, as applicable. The chairman or co-chairmen of the
meeting, as applicable, may prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures
and take such action as, in the discretion of such chairman or co-chairmen
and without any action by the stockholders, are appropriate for the proper
conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, (a) restricting
admission to the time set for the commencement of the meeting; (b) limiting
attendance at the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their
duly authorized proxies or other such persons as the chairman or co-chairmen
of the meeting, as applicable, may determine; (c) limiting participation at
the meeting on any matter to stockholders of record of the Corporation
entitled to vote on such matter, their duly authorized proxies or other such
persons as the chairman or co-chairmen of the meeting, as applicable, may
determine; (d) limiting the time allotted to questions or comments by
participants; (e) determining when and for how long the polls should be opened
and when the polls should be closed; (f) maintaining order and security at
the meeting; (g) removing any stockholder or any other individual who refuses
to comply with meeting procedures, rules or guidelines as set forth by the
chairman or co-chairmen of the meeting, as applicable; (h) concluding a
meeting or recessing or adjourning the meeting to a later date and time and
place announced at the meeting; and (i) complying with any state and local
laws and regulations concerning safety and security. Unless otherwise
determined by the chairman or co-chairmen of the meeting, as applicable,
meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with
the rules of parliamentary procedure.

  



  

Section 2.07. _QUORUM; ADJOURNMENT_. At any meeting of the
stockholders, the presence in person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to
cast 50% of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting shall constitute
a quorum except as otherwise provided by law, the Charter or these bylaws. If
a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairman
or co-chairman of the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time to a
date not more than 120 days after the original record date without notice
other than announcement at the meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a
quorum is present, any business may be transacted that might have been
transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.

  



  

The stockholders present either in person or by proxy, at a meeting which has
been duly called and convened, may continue to transact business until
adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave
fewer than required to establish a quorum.

  



  

Section 2.08. _VOTING_. The holders of a majority of the shares of
stock entitled to vote who are present in person or by proxy at an annual
meeting at which a quorum is present may, without the necessity for
concurrence by the board of directors, vote to elect a director. Each share
may be voted for as many individuals as there are directors to be elected and
for whose election the share is entitled to be voted. Except as otherwise
required by law, the Charter or these bylaws, a majority of the votes cast at
a meeting of the stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present
shall be sufficient to approve any other matter which may properly come
before the meeting. Unless otherwise provided in the Charter, each outstanding
share, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter
submitted to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

Section 2.09. _PROXIES_. A stockholder may cast the votes entitled
to be cast by the shares of stock owned of record by the stockholder in
person or by proxy executed by the stockholder or by the stockholder's duly
authorized agent in any manner permitted by law. Such proxy or evidence of
authorization of such proxy shall be filed with the secretary of the
Corporation before or at the time of the meeting. No proxy shall be valid
after eleven months from the date of its execution, unless otherwise
provided in the proxy.

  



  

Section 2.10. _VOTING OF STOCK BY CERTAIN HOLDERS_. Stock registered
in the name of a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, if entitled
to be voted, may be voted by the president, a vice president, a general
partner, or a trustee thereof, as the case may be, or a proxy appointed by
any of the foregoing individuals, unless some other person who has been
appointed to vote such stock pursuant to a bylaw or a resolution of the
governing body of such corporation or other entity or agreement of the
partners of a partnership presents a certified copy of such bylaw, resolution
or agreement, in which case such person may vote such stock. Any director or
other fiduciary may vote stock registered in his name in his capacity as such
fiduciary, either in person or by proxy.

  



  

Shares of the Corporation's stock owned directly or indirectly by it shall
not be voted at any meeting and shall not be counted in determining the total
number of outstanding shares entitled to be voted at any given time, unless
they are held by it in a fiduciary capacity, in which case, subject to the
terms of the Charter, they may be voted and shall be counted in
determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time.

  



  

The board of directors may adopt by resolution a procedure by which a
stockholder may certify in writing to the Corporation that any shares of
stock registered in the name of the stockholder are held for the account of a
specified person other than the stockholder. The resolution shall set forth
the class of stockholders who may make the certification, the purpose for
which the certification may be made, the form of certification and the
information to be contained in it; if the certification is with respect to a
record date, the time after the record date within which the certification
must be received by the Corporation; and any other provisions with respect to
the procedure which the board of directors considers necessary or desirable.
On receipt of such certification, the person specified in the certification
shall be regarded as, for the purposes set forth in the certification, the
stockholder of record of the specified stock in place of the stockholder who
makes the certification.

  



  

Section 2.11. _INSPECTORS_.

  



  

(a) The board of directors or the chairman or co-chairmen of the
meeting, as applicable, may, but need not, appoint one or more
individual inspectors or one or more entities that designate individuals as
inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. If an inspector
or inspectors are not appointed, the person presiding at the meeting may, but
need not, appoint one or more inspectors. In case any person appointed as an
inspector fails to appear or act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment
made by the board of directors in advance of the meeting or at the meeting by
the chairman or co-chairmen of the meeting, as applicable.

  



  

   

4

 



    



  

(b) The inspectors, if any, shall determine the number of shares
outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares represented at
the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity and effect of proxies,
and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all
challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count
and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the result, and do
such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote fairly. Each such
report shall be in writing and signed by him or her or by a majority of them
if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting. If there is more
than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the
inspectors. The report of the inspector or inspectors on the number of shares
represented at the meeting and the results of the voting shall be prima facie
evidence thereof.

  



  

Section 2.12. _NOMINATIONS AND STOCKHOLDER BUSINESS_.

  



  

(a) _Annual Meetings of Stockholders_.

  



  

(1) Nominations of individuals for election to the board of directors
and the proposal of other business to be considered by the stockholders may
be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (A) pursuant to the Corporation's
notice of such meeting; (B) by or at the direction of the board of directors;
or (C) by any stockholder of the Corporation who (i) was a stockholder of
record both at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section
2.12(a) and at the time of the annual meeting in question; (ii) is entitled
to vote at such meeting in the election of each individual so nominated or on
any such other business; and (iii) has complied with the notice procedures

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and
included in the Corporation's notice of the meeting) before an annual meeting
of stockholders).

(2) Without qualification, for any nominations or other business to be
properly brought at an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to this
paragraph (a)(2) or paragraph (a)(1) of this Section 2.12, the stockholder
must give timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the

stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered
to the secretary at the principal executive office of the Corporation not
earlier than the 150th day nor later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the

for the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event
that the date of the annual meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 30
days from the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's annual
meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not
earlier than the 150th day prior to the date of such annual meeting nor later

such annual meeting is made less than 130 days prior to the date of such
annual meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public
announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. In no event shall the
postponement or adjournment of an annual meeting, or the
announcement thereof, commence a new time period for the giving of a
stockholder's notice as described above. To be in proper form,
a stockholder's notice (whether given pursuant to this Section 2.12(a)(2) or
Section 2.12(b)) must: (a) set forth, as to each person, if any, whom the
stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director (i)
the name, age, business address, and residence address of such person; the

consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a
director if elected); and (ii) a description of all direct and indirect
compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and
understandings during the past three years, and any other material

proposed nominee, and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or
others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including, without
limitation all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to
Rule 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K if the stockholder making the
nomination and any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is
made, if any, or any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in
concert therewith, were the "registrant" for purposes of such rule and the
nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant; (b) with
respect to each nominee for election or re-election to the board of
directors, include a completed and signed questionnaire, representation and
agreement required by Section 2.13; (c) if the notice relates to any business
other than a nomination of a director or directors that the
stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, set forth (i) a brief
description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the
reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest
of such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
proposal is made, in such business and (ii) a description of all agreements,
arrangements and understandings between such stockholder and beneficial
owner, if any, and any other person or persons (including their names) in
connection with the proposal of such business by such stockholder; (d) set
forth, as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if
any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, (i) the name and
address of such stockholder as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of
such beneficial owner, if any; (ii) (A) the number of shares of each class or
series of stock of the Corporation that are, directly or indirectly, owned
beneficially or of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (B)
any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or
similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement
payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of
the Corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of
any class or series of shares of the Corporation, whether or not such
instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or
series of capital stock of the Corporation or otherwise (a
"Derivative Instrument") directly or indirectly owned beneficially by such
stockholder and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share
in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of
the Corporation, (C) any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or
relationship pursuant to which such stockholder has a right to vote any shares
of any security of the Corporation, (D) any short interest in any security of
the Corporation (for purposes of this Section 2.12 a person shall be deemed
to have a short interest in a security if such person directly or indirectly,
through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise,
has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease
in the value of the subject security), (E) any rights to dividends on the
shares of the Corporation owned beneficially by such stockholder that are
separated or separable from the underlying shares of the Corporation, (F) any
proportionate interest in shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments
held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which
such stockholder is a general partner or, directly or indirectly,
beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (G) any performance-
related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that such stockholder is
entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the
Corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice,
including without limitation any such interests held by members of such
stockholder's immediate family sharing the same household (which information
shall be supplemented by such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, not
later than ten days after the record date for the meeting to disclose
such ownership as of the record date), and (iii) any other information
relating to such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, that would be
required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be
made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the
proposal and/or for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant
to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder; and (e) set forth, to the extent known by the stockholder giving
the notice, the name and address of any other stockholder supporting the
nominee for election or reelection as a director or the proposal of other
business on the date of such stockholder's notice. In addition, the
Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other
information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the
eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of
the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable
stockholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such
nominee.

(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(2)
of this Section 2.12 to the contrary, in the event that the number of
directors to be elected to the board of directors is increased and there is
no public announcement naming all of the nominees for directors or specifying
the size of the increased board of directors made by the Corporation at least
130 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of mailing of the notice
for the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by
this Section 2.12(a) shall also be considered timely, but only with respect
to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be
delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation no later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the 10th day following
the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Special Meetings of Stockholders_. Only such business shall
be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been
brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of said
meeting. Nominations of individuals for election to the board of directors
may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be
elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of said meeting (i) by or at the
direction of the board of directors or (ii) provided that such special meeting
has been called in accordance with Section 2.03 of this Article II for the
purpose of electing directors, by any stockholder of the Corporation who (A)
is a stockholder of record both at the time of giving of notice provided for
in this Section 2.12(b) and at the time of the special meeting; (B) is
entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so
nominated; and (C) complied with the notice procedures set forth in this
Section 2.12(b). In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of
stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the board
of directors, any such stockholder may nominate an individual or individuals
(as the case may be) for election to such position as specified in the
Corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice containing the
information required by paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 2.12 with respect to
any nomination (including the completed and signed questionnaire,
representation and agreement required by Section 2.13) shall be delivered
to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not
earlier than the 120th day prior to such special meeting nor later than 5:00
p.m., Eastern Time, on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting
or, if the first public announcement of the date of such special meeting is
made less than 100 days prior to the date of such special meeting, the 10th
day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date
of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the board of directors
to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the postponement or
adjournment of a special meeting, or the announcement thereof, commence a new
time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.

(c) _General_.

  



  

(1) If information submitted pursuant to this Section 2.12 by any
stockholder proposing a nominee for election as a director or any
proposal for other business at a meeting of stockholders shall be inaccurate
in any material respect, such information may be deemed not to have been
provided in accordance with this Section 2.12. Any such stockholder shall
notify the Corporation of any inaccuracy or change (within two business days
of becoming aware of such inaccuracy or change) in any such information. Upon
written request by the secretary or the board of directors, any such
stockholder shall provide, within five business days of delivery of
such request (or such other period as may be specified in such request), (i)
written verification, satisfactory, in the discretion of the board of
directors or any authorized officer of the Corporation, to demonstrate the
accuracy of any information submitted by the stockholder pursuant to this
Section 2.12 and (ii) a written update of any information submitted by the
stockholder pursuant to this Section 2.12 as of an earlier date. If a
stockholder fails to provide such written verification or written update

(2) Only such individuals who are nominated in accordance with this
Section 2.12 shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business
shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought
before the meeting in accordance with this Section 2.12. The chairman or co-
chairman of the meeting shall have the power to determine whether a nomination
or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or
proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with this Section 2.12, and, if
any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this Section
2.12, to declare that such defective nomination or proposal, if any, be
disregarded.

notice" shall have the same meaning as "the date of the company's proxy
statement released to shareholders" as used in Rule 14a-8(e) promulgated under

from time to time. "Public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press
release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable

Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.12; provided,
however, that any references in this Section 2.12 to the Exchange Act or the
rules promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the
requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business
to be considered pursuant to Section 2.12(a)(1)(C) or Section 2.12(b).
Nothing in this Section 2.12 shall be deemed to affect any rights of
stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in, or the right of the
Corporation to omit a proposal from, the Corporation's proxy
statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. Nothing in this
Section 2.12 shall require disclosure of revocable proxies received by the
stockholder pursuant to a solicitation of proxies after the filing of an
effective Schedule 14A by such stockholder under Section 14(a) of the
Exchange Act.

be necessary to make it effective unless otherwise stated in the resignation.

  



  

Section 3.03. _ANNUAL AND REGULAR MEETINGS_. An annual meeting of the
board of directors shall be held immediately after and at the same place as
the annual meeting of stockholders, no notice other than this bylaw being

provided for special meetings of the board of directors. The board of
directors may provide, by resolution, the time and place, either within or

board of directors without other notice than such resolution.

  



  

Section 3.04. _SPECIAL MEETINGS_. Special meetings of the board of

shall constitute a quorum for transaction of business at any meeting of the

are present at said meeting, a majority of the directors present may adjourn

that, if pursuant to the Charter or these bylaws, the vote of a majority of a
particular group of directors is required for action, a quorum must also

been duly called and at which a quorum was established may continue to
transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough
directors to leave fewer than required to establish a quorum.

  



  

Section 3.07. _VOTING_. The action of the majority of the directors
present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the action of the
board of directors, unless the concurrence of a greater proportion is required
for such action by the MGCL or the Charter. If enough directors have
withdrawn from a meeting to leave fewer than required to establish a quorum
but the meeting is not adjourned, the action of the majority of that number

action of the board of directors, unless the concurrence of a greater
proportion is required for such action by the MGCL or the Charter.

meeting of the board of directors by means of a conference telephone or other

Section 3.11. _REMOVAL_. At any meeting of stockholders called
expressly, but not necessarily solely, for that purpose, any director or the
entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by a vote of
the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote on the election
of directors.

  



  

Section 3.12. _VACANCIES_. If for any reason any or all the directors
cease to be directors, such event shall not terminate the Corporation or
affect these bylaws or the powers of the remaining directors hereunder (even
if fewer than the statutory minimum remain). Until such time as the
Corporation becomes subject to Section 3-804(c) of the MGCL, a successor to
fill a vacancy on the board of directors that results from the removal of a
director may be elected by either (a) the stockholders or (b) a majority of
the remaining directors, even if such majority is less than a quorum; any
vacancy on the board of directors for any other cause shall be filled by a
majority of the remaining directors, even if such majority is less than a
quorum; and any individual so elected as director shall serve until the next
annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is elected and
qualifies. At such time as the Corporation becomes subject to Section
3-804(c) of the MGCL and except as may be provided by the board of directors
in setting the terms of any class or series of preferred stock, any vacancy on
the board of directors may be filled only by a majority of the remaining
directors, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum, and any
director elected to fill a vacancy shall serve for the remainder of the full
term of the directorship in which the vacancy occurred and until a successor
is elected and qualifies. The Conflicts Committee (as defined and created by
the Charter) shall nominate replacements for vacancies among the Independent
Directors positions.

or activity performed or engaged in as directors on behalf of the Corporation.
Directors may be reimbursed for expenses of attendance, if any, at each
annual, regular or special meeting of the board of directors or of any
committee thereof and for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, if any, in
connection with each such meeting, property visit, and/or other service or

Corporation. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any
director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving
compensation therefor.

  



  

Section 3.14. _LOSS OF DEPOSITS_. No director shall be liable for any
loss which may occur by reason of the failure of the bank, trust company,

affiliated with the advisor shall be expected to devote his full time to the
efforts of the Corporation unless he agrees in writing to do so. Any director
or officer of the Corporation, in his personal capacity or in a capacity
as an affiliate, employee, or agent of any other person, or otherwise, may
have business interests and engage in business activities similar to, in
addition to, or in competition with those of or relating to the Corporation,
subject to the provisions of the Charter.

  



  

Section 3.17. _RELIANCE_. Each director and officer of the
Corporation shall, in the performance of his or her duties with respect to
the Corporation, be entitled to rely on any information, opinion, report or
statement, including any financial statement or other financial data,
prepared or presented by an officer or employee of the Corporation whom the
director or officer reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the
matters presented, by a lawyer, certified public accountant or other person,
as to a matter which the director or officer reasonably believes to be within
the person's professional or expert competence, or, with respect to a
director, by a committee of the board of directors on which the director does
not serve, as to a matter within its designated authority, if the director
reasonably believes the committee to merit confidence.

  



  

Section 3.18. _RATIFICATION_. The board of directors or the
stockholders may ratify and make binding on the Corporation any action or
inaction by the Corporation or its officers to the extent that the board of
directors or the stockholders could have originally authorized the matter.
Moreover, any action or inaction questioned in any stockholders' derivative
proceeding or any other proceeding on the ground of lack of authority,
defective or irregular execution, adverse interest of a director, officer or
stockholder, non-disclosure, miscomputation, the application of improper
principles or practices of accounting, or otherwise, may be ratified, before
or after judgment, by the board of directors or by the stockholders, and if so
ratified, shall have the same force and effect as if the questioned action or
inaction had been originally duly authorized, and such ratification shall be
binding upon the Corporation and its stockholders and shall constitute a bar
to any claim or execution of any judgment in respect of such
questioned action or inaction.

  



  

Section 3.19. _EMERGENCY PROVISIONS_. Notwithstanding any other
provision in the Charter or these bylaws, this Section 3.19 shall apply
during the existence of any catastrophe, or other similar emergency condition,
as a result of which a quorum of the board of directors under Article III of
these bylaws cannot readily be obtained (an "Emergency"). During any
Emergency, unless otherwise provided by the board of directors, (a) a meeting
of the board of directors or a committee thereof may be called by any
director or officer by any means feasible under the circumstances; (b) notice
of any meeting of the board of directors during such an Emergency may be
given less than 24 hours prior to the meeting to as many directors and by such
means as may be feasible at the time, including publication, television or
radio, and (c) the number of directors necessary to constitute a quorum shall
be one-third of the entire board of directors.

ARTICLE VII

  



  

STOCK

  



  

Section 7.01. _CERTIFICATES_. Unless otherwise provided by the board
of directors, the Corporation shall not issue stock certificates. In the
event that the Corporation issues shares of stock represented by certificates,
such certificates shall be in such form as prescribed by the board of
directors or a duly authorized officer, shall contain the statements and
information required by the MGCL and shall be signed by the officers of the
Corporation in the manner permitted by the MGCL. In the event that the
Corporation issues shares of stock without certificates, to the extent then
required by the MGCL, the Corporation shall provide to the record holders of
such shares a written statement of the information required by the MGCL to be
included on stock certificates. There shall be no differences in the rights
and obligations of stockholders based on whether or not their shares are
represented by certificates. If a class or series of stock is uncertificated,
no stockholder shall be entitled to a certificate or
certificates representing any shares of such class or series of stock held by
such stockholder unless otherwise determined by the board of directors and
then only upon written request by such stockholder to the secretary of the
Corporation.

  



  

Section 7.02. _TRANSFERS; REGISTERED STOCKHOLDERS_. Transfers of
shares of any class of stock will be subject in all respects to the Charter
and all of the terms and conditions contained therein. The Corporation shall
be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share of stock as the holder
in fact thereof and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any
equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or on the part of any
other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof,
except as otherwise provided by the laws of the State of Maryland. All
transfers of shares of stock shall be made on the books of the Corporation,
by the holder of the shares, in person or by his attorney, in such manner as
the board of directors or any officer of the Corporation may prescribe and,
if such shares are certificated, upon surrender of certificates duly
endorsed. The issuance of a new certificate upon the transfer of certificated
shares is subject to the determination of the board of directors that such
shares shall no longer be represented by certificates. Upon the transfer of
uncertificated shares, to the extent then required by the MGCL, the
Corporation shall provide to record holders of such shares a written statement
of the information required by the MGCL to be included on stock certificates.

Section 7.03. _REPLACEMENT CERTIFICATES_. The Corporation shall
issue a new certificate in place of any certificate for shares previously
issued if the registered owner of the certificate satisfies the following
requirements:

  



  

(a) _Claim_. The registered owner makes proof in affidavit form
that a previously issued certificate for shares has been lost, destroyed,
stolen or mutilated;

  



  

(b) _Timely Request_. The registered owner requests the issuance
of a new certificate before the Corporation has notice that the
certificate has been acquired by a purchaser for value in good faith and
without notice of an adverse claim;

  



  

(c) _Bond_. Unless otherwise determined by an officer of the
Corporation, the registered owner gives a bond in such form, and with such
surety or sureties, with fixed or open penalty, as the board of directors may
direct, in its discretion, to indemnify the Corporation (and its transfer
agent and registrar, if any) against any claim that may be made on account of
the alleged loss, destruction, or theft of the certificate; and

  



  

(d) _Other Requirements_. The registered owner satisfies any other
reasonable requirements imposed by the board of directors.

  



  

When a certificate has been lost, destroyed, stolen or mutilated and the
stockholder of record fails to notify the Corporation within a reasonable
time after he has notice of it, if the Corporation registers a transfer of the
shares represented by the certificate before receiving such notification, the
stockholder of record is precluded from making any claim against the
Corporation for the transfer or for a new certificate. In addition, if the
shares represented by the certificate have ceased to be certificated, no new
certificate shall be issued unless requested in writing by the stockholder of
record and the board of directors has determined that such certificates may
be issued.

  



  

 Section 7.04. _FIXING OF RECORD DATE_. The board of directors may
set, in advance, a record date for the purpose of determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or determining
stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or the allotment of
any other rights, or in order to make a determination of stockholders for any
other proper purpose (such record date, in any case, may not be prior to the
close of business on the day the record date is fixed and shall be not more
than 90 days before the date on which the meeting or particular action
requiring such determination of stockholders of record is to be held or
taken).

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

When a record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice
of and to vote at any meeting of stockholders has been set as provided in
this section, such record date shall continue to apply to the meeting if
adjourned or postponed, except if the meeting is adjourned to a date more
than 120 days or postponed to a date more than 90 days after the record date
originally fixed for the meeting, in which case a new record date for such
meeting may be determined as set forth herein.

  



  

Section 7.05. _STOCK LEDGER_. The Corporation shall maintain at one
or more of its principal offices or at the office of its
counsel, accountants, or transfer agent, an original or duplicate share
ledger containing the name and address of each stockholder and the number of
shares of each class held by such stockholder.

  



  

Section 7.06. _FRACTIONAL STOCK; ISSUANCE OF UNITS_. The Corporation
may issue fractional stock or provide for the issuance of scrip, all on such
terms and under such conditions as the board of directors may determine.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Charter or these bylaws, the board
of directors may issue units consisting of different securities of the
Corporation. Any security issued in a unit shall have the same
characteristics as any identical securities issued by the Corporation,
except that the board of directors may provide that for a specified period
securities of the Corporation issued in such unit may be transferred on the
books of the Corporation only in such unit.

  



  

ARTICLE VIII

  



  

ACCOUNTING YEAR

  



  

The board of directors shall have the power, from time to time, to fix the
fiscal year of the Corporation by a duly adopted resolution.

  



  

ARTICLE IX

  



  

DISTRIBUTIONS

  



  

Section 9.01. _AUTHORIZATION_. Dividends and other distributions upon
the stock of the Corporation may be authorized by the board of directors,
subject to the provisions of law and the Charter. Dividends and other
distributions may be paid in cash, property or stock of the Corporation,
subject to the provisions of law and the Charter.

  



  

Section 9.02. _CONTINGENCIES_. Before payment of any dividends or
other distributions, there may be set aside out of any assets of the
Corporation available for dividends or other distributions such sum or sums as
the board of directors may from time to time, in its absolute discretion,
think proper as a reserve fund for contingencies, for equalizing dividends,
for repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation or for such
other purpose as the board of directors shall determine, and the board of
directors may modify or abolish any such reserve.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

ARTICLE X

  



  

INVESTMENT POLICY

  



  

Subject to the provisions of the Charter, the board of directors may from
time to time adopt, amend, revise or terminate any policy or policies with
respect to investments by the Corporation as it shall deem appropriate in its
sole discretion.

  



  

ARTICLE XI

  



  

SEAL

  



  

Section 11.01. _SEAL_. The board of directors may authorize the
adoption of a seal by the Corporation. The seal shall contain the name of the
Corporation and the year of its incorporation and the words "Incorporated
Maryland." The board of directors may authorize one or more duplicate seals
and provide for the custody thereof.

  



  

Section 11.02. _AFFIXING SEAL_. Whenever the Corporation is permitted
or required to affix its seal to a document, it shall be sufficient to meet
the requirements of any law, rule or regulation relating to a seal to place
"[SEAL]" adjacent to the signature of the person authorized to execute the
document on behalf of the Corporation.

  



  

ARTICLE XII

  



  

WAIVER OF NOTICE

  



  

Whenever any notice of a meeting is required to be given pursuant to the
Charter or these bylaws or pursuant to applicable law, a waiver thereof in
writing or by electronic transmission, given by the person or persons entitled
to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be
deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Neither the business to be
transacted at nor the purpose of any meeting need be set forth in the waiver
of notice, unless specifically required by statute. The attendance of any
person at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting,
except where such person attends a meeting for the express purpose of
objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is
not lawfully called or convened.

  



  

ARTICLE XIII

  



  

AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS

  



  

Subject to Section 5.07(c), the board of directors shall have the exclusive
power to adopt, alter or repeal any provision of these bylaws and to make new
bylaws.

LICENSE AGREEMENT

  



  

This LICENSE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of ____________, 2017,
(the " _Effective Date_ ") is entered into by and between PECO Real Estate
Partners (" _Licensee_ ") and Phillips Edison Grocery Center Operating
Partnership I, L.P. (" _Licensor_ "). Licensee and Licensor shall each be
referred to as a " _Party_ " and collectively the " _Parties_ ".

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Contribution Agreement, dated as of May 18,
2017 (the " _Signing Date_ ") (such agreement, the " _Contribution Agreement_
"), by and among the Contributors listed on Exhibit A thereto (each, a "
_Contributor_ "), Licensor, Jeffrey S. Edison, and the other parties set
forth therein, each Contributor transferred substantially all of their
respective assets to Licensor;

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Contribution Agreement, Contributors
agreed to transferred and assigned to Licensor any right, title and interest
that Contributors may have in and to the name "PECO" (the " _Licensed Name_
"), subject to Licensor agreeing to grant a royalty-free, fully-paid up,
perpetual license in the Licensed Name back to Licensee hereunder;

  



  

WHEREAS, Licensee has been using the Licensed Name in connection with the
operation of its business prior to the Effective Date;

  



  

WHEREAS, in connection with such assignment of the Licensed Name as
contemplated in the Contribution Agreement, Licensor agreed to grant to
Licensee the right to use the Licensed Name as set forth herein;

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the covenants and
agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

  



  

1. _License Grant_. Licensor, on behalf of itself and any of its affiliates that may have any rights in and to the Licensed Names, hereby grants to Licensee a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as permitted in Section 5(d)), non-assignable (except as permitted in Section 5(d)), non-sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid up, worldwide, irrevocable limited right and license to use, reproduce and commercially exploit the Licensed Name in connection with the operation of its business (e.g., in its corporate names, marketing and promotional materials, websites, domain names, social media pages, stationery, and similar uses) (the " _Licensed Use_ ").

  



  

2. _Protection and Ownership of Licensed Name Uses_.

  



  

 (a) Licensee acknowledges that certain goodwill and reputation may
be associated with the Licensed Name and agrees to use the Licensed Name only
in a manner that maintains and promotes such goodwill and reputation, which
use otherwise shall be a material breach of this Agreement. Licensee shall
cooperate with Licensor in facilitating the Licensor's control of the nature
and quality of the products and other uses of the Licensed Name, provided
however that Licensor agrees that Licensee shall not require Licensor's
approval to use the Licensed Name for the Licensed Use in a manner that is
materially consistent with how Licensee was using the Licensed Name
immediately prior to the Signing Date. Further, Licensee agrees that any use
of the Licensed Name in a manner that materially deviates from how such
Licensed Name was used by Licensee immediately prior to the Signing Date will
require the prior written approval of Licensor, not to be unreasonably
conditioned, delayed or withheld.

and expense, for purposes of securing and preserving Licensor's or its
affiliates' rights in and the Licensed Name.

  



  

 (c) In the event that Licensor or its affiliates wish to abandon
or cease using the Licensed Name, Licensor shall first provide 60 days'
written notice to Licensee before commencing such action (an " _Abandonment
Notice_ "). Thereafter, Licensee shall have the right to receive an
assignment of such Licensed Name as the new owner, which right may be
exercised in Licensee's sole discretion upon written notice to Licensor sent
within 60 days after Licensee's receipt of the Abandonment Notice.

  



  

3. _Term and Termination_.

continue in perpetuity, except if terminated pursuant to Section 3(b) or 3(c)

this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

  



  

4. _LIMITATION OF LIABILITY_. NO PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, AND THE LIKE, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DAMAGE IS CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE OF THE OTHER PARTY.

  



  

5. _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

 (a) _Independent Contractor_. The Parties are and at all times

agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes any other agreements, whether written or oral, that may have been
made or entered into by or among any of the Parties or any of their
respective affiliates relating to the subject matter hereof. The Parties each
hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the justifiable expectations
of sophisticated parties derived from arm's-length negotiations, and all
Parties to this Agreement specifically acknowledge that no Party has any
special relationship with another Party that would justify any expectation
beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller of services in an
arm's-length transaction.

  



  

(h) _Amendments; Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended,
supplemented or modified in whole or in part if, but only if, such amendment,
supplement or modification is in writing and is signed by each Party and

of this Agreement may be waived if, but only if, such waiver is in writing and
is signed by the Party or Parties against whom enforcement of any such waiver
is sought and specific reference to this Agreement is made in such writing.
The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall
not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach
or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of
any Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such Party preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or remedy.

  



  

(i) _Severability_. If any provision hereof (or any portion
thereof) or the application of any such provision (or any portion thereof) to
any Party or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof (or the
remaining portion thereof) or the application of such provision to any other
Parties or circumstances.

the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, if an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed

arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT) THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR
RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE
APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE,
WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES OF SUCH STATE.

    



  

(l) _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ITS
RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION OR OTHER COURT PROCEEDING WITH
RESPECT TO ANY MATTER ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.

  



  

(n) _Remedies Cumulative_. The rights and remedies of the Parties
under or pursuant to this Agreement are cumulative, and no single or partial
exercise by a Party of any right or remedy precludes or otherwise affects the
exercise of any other right or remedy to which that Party may be entitled.

  



  

(o) _Further Assurances_. If any further action is necessary,
proper or desirable to carry out any purpose of this Agreement, then each
Party hereto will take such further action (including the execution and
delivery of further documents) as the other Party hereto reasonably requests

requesting Party, except to the extent such requesting Party is entitled to
indemnification therefor or to the extent this Agreement otherwise allocates
such expense to the other Party.
