connection with the Merger shall be placed in escrow by Parent as security

1.8_ , neither Parent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of

official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. In addition, in the event that any of the Upfront Consideration other

First Tranche Period and the Second Tranche Period, respectively. In no event
shall the Gross Profit applicable to either the First Tranche Period or the
Second Tranche Period have any effect on either (A) the Gross Profit
applicable to the other period, or (B) the Earn-Out Payment (if any) payable

1.9(b)(iii)_ ) at the date upon which Parent delivers shares of Parent Common
Stock in respect of the First Tranche or Second Tranche, as the case may be,
to the Payment Agent. The certificates representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock, if any, that may be issued pursuant to the First Tranche or
Second Tranche, as the case may be, shall bear appropriate legends to identify
such shares as being "restricted securities" (within the meaning of Rule
144(a)(3) under the Securities Act), and the Parent Common Stock, if any,
issued in the First Tranche or Second Tranche, as the case may be, in reliance
upon such exemptions from registration will be based in part upon the
representations of such former Company Stockholder contained in the
Stockholder Support Agreement. The sale or transfer of any shares of Parent
Common Stock issued pursuant to the First Tranche or Second Tranche, as the
case may be, may only be made (i) pursuant to the Registration Statement (as
defined in _Section 1.9(b)(iii)_ ), (ii) in conformity with the provisions of
Rule 144 under the Securities Act or (iii) pursuant to the receipt by Parent
of an opinion  



 

-19-  in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent from counsel to such
former Company Stockholder to the effect that such transfer may be made
without registration under the Securities Act. Parent may instruct its
transfer agent to stop the transfer of any shares of Parent Common Stock
issued pursuant to the First Tranche or Second Tranche, as the case may be, if
any, unless Parent shall have been provided with evidence of compliance with
the foregoing reasonably satisfactory to Parent.



(iii) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares
of Parent Common stock that may be issued in the First Tranche or Second
Tranche, as the case may be, to be registered for resale under the Securities
Act on a Form S-3 as provided in this _Section 1.9(b)(iii)_. In the event that
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") permits Parent to
register the shares of Parent Common Stock that may be issued in the First
Tranche or Second Tranche, as the case may be, on a Form S-3 for resale (a "
_Registration Statement_ ") prior to payment of the First Tranche or Second
Tranche, as applicable, then prior to payment of the First Tranche or Second
Tranche, as applicable, (i) Parent shall have filed a Registration Statement
prior to payment of the First Tranche or Second Tranche, as applicable, and
(ii) the Registration Statement shall have been declared effective by the SEC
and shall remain effective at the time any shares of Parent Common Stock are
distributed to such former Company Stockholders. In the event that the SEC
will not permit Parent to register the shares of Parent Common Stock that may
be issued in the First Tranche or Second Tranche, as the case may be, on a
Registration Statement prior to payment of the First Tranche or Second
Tranche, as applicable, including by way of advising Parent to such effect in
a telephone call between Parents counsel and a member of the staff of the
SEC prior to the filing of the Registration Statement (in which call counsel
to the Stockholder Representative shall be permitted to participate), Parent
shall have no further obligation make further inquiry with the SEC in this
regard and shall have no obligations under the first sentence of _Section
1.9(b)(iii)_ , and in lieu thereof Parent shall (i) file the Registration
Statement within two (2) business days after payment of the First Tranche or
Second Tranche, as applicable, and (ii) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to have such Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as
soon as practicable after such filing. In connection with any such
Registration Statement, Parent shall (i) maintain the effectiveness of any
such Registration Statement for a period of at least one year from the date of
issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock included in the Second Tranche,
or if no shares of Parent Common Stock have been or will be issued in the
Second Tranche, the effective date of such Registration Statement, subject in
each case to the good faith judgment of the board of directors of Parent that
it is advisable to delay or suspend the use of the prospectus for
a reasonable discrete period of time due to pending corporate developments,
or that there exists material nonpublic information about Parent that the
board of directors, acting in good faith, determines not to disclose in the
Registration Statement, and (ii) take such reasonable steps as may be
reasonably necessary to comply with the securities and blue sky laws of all
jurisdictions which are applicable to the issuance of the Parent Common Stock
pursuant to such Earn-Out Payment.



 

-20- (iv) If Parent informs the former Company Stockholders set forth on _Schedule
1.9(b)_ in writing that it is electing to pay an Earn-Out Payment in Parent
Common Stock, such former Company Stockholders (or if any such former Company
Stockholder that is a limited partnership, limited liability company or
similar entity shall have distributed such shares of Parent Common Stock to
its limited partners, members or stockholders in compliance with an exemption
from registration under the Securities Act, any such limited partner, member
or stockholder) shall provide Parent with all information requested by Parent
as shall be required pursuant to the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder to effect the registration of such former Company
Stockholders (or such former Company Stockholders limited
partners, members or stockholders) shares of Parent Common Stock. In the
event that any former Company Stockholder (or limited partner, member or
stockholder of such former Company Stockholder) shall have failed to furnish
to Parent such information, Parent shall not be required to include such
former Company Stockholders (or such former Company Stockholders limited
partners, members or stockholders) shares of Parent Common Stock in the
Registration Statement; _provided_ that Parent shall have requested such
information from such former Company Stockholder not later than fourteen (14)
days prior to the filing date of the Registration Statement.



(c) _Determination of Earn-Out Payment_. Parent shall, on not less than a
quarterly basis during the First Tranche Period and the Second Tranche Period,
as soon as practicable following the date that Parent shall publicly announce
its earnings for the applicable quarter, provide the Stockholder
Representative with interim written reports with respect to Net Sales, Cost
of Goods Sold and Gross Profit for the immediately preceding quarter, together
with reasonably detailed documentary evidence supporting the basis for such
calculation, and shall, upon the request of the Stockholder Representative,
meet with the Stockholder Representative once per quarter at a mutually agreed
upon time and location to discuss such information. In addition, prior to
making any Earn-Out Payment under the First Tranche or Second Tranche, as
applicable, to the Payment Agent, Parent shall deliver to the Stockholder
Representative as soon as practicable, and in any event, no later than March
15, 2005, in the case of the First Tranche, and March 15, 2006, in the
case of the Second Tranche, a schedule setting forth the computation of the
applicable Earn-Out Payment and a copy of the financial information used in
making such computation, together with reasonably detailed documentary
evidence supporting the basis for such calculation. If applicable, such
schedule shall also set forth any proposed set-off for Excess Losses in
accordance with _Section 7.6(b)_ and the net aggregate amount, if any, of such
Earn-Out Payment, after giving effect to such set-off, to be distributed to
the former Company Stockholders. Parents computation of the gross amount of
any Earn-Out Payment (prior to any possible set-off for Excess Losses) under
this _Section 1.9_ shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto
unless, within thirty (30) days following the Stockholder Representatives
receipt of such schedule, the Stockholder Representative notifies Parent in
writing that it disagrees with Parents computation of the applicable Earn-
Out Payment. Such notice shall include a schedule setting forth the
Stockholder Representatives computation of the payment together with a copy
of any information, other than that previously provided by Parent, used in
making such computation.



 

-21- (d) _Dispute Resolution_. If Parent disagrees with the Stockholder
Representatives computation, an officer of Parent shall promptly meet with
the Stockholder Representative and the parties shall attempt in good faith to
reach a resolution of such disagreement. If such disagreement is not resolved
within fifteen (15) days after delivery of the Stockholder Representatives
notice, either party may request that the Independent Auditors compute the
amount of the applicable Earn-Out Payment as promptly as practicable and such
computation shall be binding upon the parties hereto. Each of the parties to
this Agreement shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates and
representatives to, provide full cooperation to the Independent Auditors. The
Independent Auditors shall (x) act in its capacity as an expert and not as an
arbitrator, (y) consider only those matters as to which there is a dispute
between the parties and (z) be instructed to reach its conclusions regarding
any such dispute within thirty (30) days after its appointment and provide a
written explanation of its decision. In the event that Parent or the
Stockholder Representative submit any dispute to the Independent Auditors,
each such party may submit a "position paper" to the Independent Auditors
setting forth the position of such party with respect to such dispute, to be
considered by such Independent Auditors as it deems fit. Fifty percent (50%)
of any expenses relating to the engagement of the Independent Auditors shall
be paid by Parent and fifty percent (50%) of such expenses shall be paid by
the Stockholder Representative. If the Independent Auditors determine (or
Parent and the Stockholder Representative otherwise agree) that the final
amount of any Earn-Out Payment due hereunder is greater than the portion of
such Earn-Out Payment actually paid by Parent on the original due date
therefor, then Parent shall, within five (5) days after such determination or
agreement, make such additional payment to the Payment Agent, and such amount
shall be immediately paid by the Payment Agent by check delivered to the
addresses of the former Company Stockholders entitled thereto. The foregoing
provisions shall be applicable only to the calculation of the gross amount of
such Earn-Out Payment, and not to the calculation of the amount of any
possible set-off for Excess Losses, which shall be governed by the dispute
resolution procedures set forth in _Section 7.6(b)_.



(e) _Rights Not Transferable._ The rights of former Company Stockholders to
the Earn-Out Payment will not be represented by a certificate, are personal
to each former Company Stockholder and shall not be transferable for any
reason other than by operation of law, will or the laws of descent and
distribution. Any attempted transfer of such right by any holder thereof
(other than as permitted by the immediately preceding sentence) shall be null
and void.



(f) _Sale of Business_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, in the event that prior to the end of the Second Tranche
Period Parent or any of its subsidiaries shall sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of for value the Earn-Out Operating Unit or all or any significant
portion of the business or assets of the Earn-Out Operating Unit, other than
in connection with any merger,  



 

-22-  consolidation, liquidation or change of control involving Parent or a sale
of substantially all of Parents assets, (a " _Company Sale_ ") for a price
that is greater than the sum of (i) $110,700,000 _plus_ (ii) any Earn-Out
Payments paid or earned and payable for any full or partial tranche period
prior to the consummation of such Company Sale (the " _Company Sale
Price Floor_ "), then within ten (10) days after the consummation of such
Company Sale Parent shall pay to the Payment Agent on behalf of and for
distribution to the former Company Stockholders in accordance with their
respective Allocable Portions, an amount in cash equal to fifty percent (50%)
of the value of all consideration received by Parent or its subsidiaries in
connection with such Company Sale in excess of the Company Price Floor, such
payment not to exceed the maximum amount of Earn-Out Payments potentially
payable hereunder with respect to any full or partial tranche period ending
after the closing date of such Company Sale. For purposes of the foregoing,
(i) the Earn-Out Payments earned and payable prior to the consummation of
such Company Sale for the tranche period in which such Company Sale shall
occur shall be determined by pro-rating the ceiling, difference, floor and
maximum payout (each, an " _Earn-Out Metric_ ") for such tranche period by
the portion of such tranche period occurring prior to the consummation of such
Company Sale and applying such pro-rated Earn-Out Metrics to the Gross Profit
realized during such portion of the applicable tranche period, and (ii) the
maximum amount of Earn-Out Payments potentially payable hereunder with
respect to the remainder of such tranche period following the consummation of
such Company Sale shall be determined by pro-rating the maximum payout for
such tranche period by the portion of such period following the consummation
of such Company Sale. If the consideration received by Parent or its
subsidiaries in connection with such Company Sale is paid in actively traded
securities listed on The Nasdaq National Market (or another applicable
national securities exchange), such securities shall be valued at the average
of the closing prices of such securities, as reported on The Nasdaq National
Market (or such other applicable national securities exchange), for each
of the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date such
securities are issued to Parent or its subsidiaries. If such consideration is
paid in securities which are not actively traded or in any other form other
than cash, the value shall be the fair market value thereof, as mutually
determined by Parent and the Stockholder Representative, _provided_ that if
Parent and the Stockholder Representative are unable to reach an agreement
after thirty (30) days, then by independent appraisal by Standard and Poors
Corporate Value Consulting (or another nationally recognized independent
appraiser mutually agreeable to Parent and the Stockholder Representative)
(the " _Independent Appraiser_ "). If all or such portion of the business or
assets sold in such Company Sale shall be sold together with other assets of
Parent or its subsidiaries (a " _Combined Company Sale_ "), the consideration
paid in such Combined Company Sale shall be allocated between all or such
portion of the business or assets of the Earn-Out Operating Unit as shall be
sold in such Combined Company Sale and such other assets of Parent or its
subsidiaries as shall be sold in such Combined Company Sale shall be as
mutually determined by Parent and the Stockholder Representative, _provided_
that if Parent and the Stockholder Representative are unable to reach an
agreement after thirty (30) days, then by the Independent Appraiser. Fifty
percent (50%) of any expenses relating to the engagement of the Independent
Appraiser under this _Section 1.9(f)_ shall be



 

-23-  paid by Parent and fifty percent (50%) of such expenses shall be paid by the
Stockholder Representative. Any amount of consideration from a Company Sale
to which the former Company Stockholders shall be entitled shall be
immediately paid by the Payment Agent by check delivered to the addresses of
the former Company Stockholders entitled thereto. Following a Company Sale,
neither Parent nor the purchaser of all or such portion of the Companys
business or assets in such Company Sale shall have any obligation to make
Earn-Out Payments hereunder with respect to any period ending after the
closing date of such Company Sale. In the event that prior to the end of the
Second Tranche Period Parent shall sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of for
value any portion, but less than all, of the Earn-Out Operating Unit (a "
_Partial Sale_ "), Parent, the Stockholder Representative and Bill Ernstrom
shall negotiate in good faith appropriate revisions to the Earn-Out Metrics
and the Earn-Out Operating Plan (as defined in _Section 1.9(g)_ ) and to
determine any portion of the proceeds from such Partial Sale as to which the
former Company Stockholders may appropriately be entitled, taking into account
in each case, among other things, the price paid in such Partial Sale and the
relative contributions of the portions of the Earn-Out Operating Unit sold
in such Partial Sale and retained by Parent to the Gross Profit realized
prior to the consummation of such Partial Sale.



(g) _Earn-Out Operating Plan; Management of Earn-Out Operating Unit_. Parent
shall provide to the Surviving Corporation or the applicable business unit
providing Earn-Out Products (the " _Earn-Out Operating Unit_ ") reasonably
adequate resources and reasonable support through the end of the Second
Tranche Period to allow it a reasonable opportunity to operate in accordance
with the operating plan attached as _Schedule 1.9(g)_ (the " _Earn-Out
Operating Plan_ "). At least until the end of the Second Tranche Period,
except as otherwise provided in this _Section 1.9(g)_ and, with respect to web
hosted services, _Section 1.9(i)_ , Bill Ernstrom shall retain authority to
manage the Earn-Out Operating Units research and development, sales,
marketing, operations, product engineering and administrative functions,
_provided_ that the Earn-Out Operating Unit shall be operated in accordance
with Parents policies and procedures applied within and across its operating
units as in effect from time to time to the extent such policies and
procedures do not restrict Mr. Ernstroms authority to direct the Cost of
Goods Sold and direct operating expenses of the Earn-Out Operating Unit up to
the amounts set forth on the Earn-Out Operating Plan on the line entitled
"Direct Operating Expense" for the applicable quarter under the section of
the Earn-Out Plan entitled "Earn-Out View" (as it may be adjusted pursuant to
_Section 1.9(i)_ ).



(i) _Termination Based On Threshold Contribution Profit_. Subject to _Section
1.9(h)_ , in the event that the Earn-Out Operating Unit shall either (x) fail
to achieve a quarterly contribution profit equal to Gross Profit less
operating expenses calculated in accordance with the Earn-Out Operating Plan
(" _Contribution Profit_ ") that is greater than or equal to the Contribution
Profit set forth on the Earn-Out Operating Plan on the line entitled
"Quarterly Threshold Contribution Profit" under the section of the Earn-Out
Plan entitled "Threshold View" (as it may be adjusted pursuant to  _Section
1.9(i)_ ) for any two (2) consecutive quarters, or (ii) at any time after the
end of the second, third or fourth quarters in the First Tranche Period or
Second Tranche Period fail  



 

-24-  to achieve a cumulative Contribution Profit as of the end of such period
that is greater than or equal to the Contribution Profit set forth on the
Earn-Out Operating Plan on the line entitled "Cumulative Threshold
Contribution Profit" under the section of the Earn-Out Plan entitled
"Threshold View" (as it may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.9(i)_ ) for any
such calendar year through such measurement date, then Parent shall be
entitled to manage the components of Cost of Goods Sold and direct operating
expenses of the Earn-Out Operating Unit, as set forth in the Earn-Out
Operating Plan, in order to cause the Earn-Out Operating Unit to achieve the
quarterly Contribution Profit identified on the Earn-Out Operating Plan under
the section of the Earn-Out Plan entitled "Earn-Out View" (as it may be
adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.9(i)_ ).



(ii) _Termination Based On Quarterly Change Control Contribution Profit_.
Subject to _Section 1.9(h)_ , in the event that the Earn-Out Operating Unit
shall fail to achieve a quarterly Contribution Profit that is greater than or
equal to the Contribution Profit set forth on the Earn-Out Operating Plan
on the line entitled "Quarterly Change Control Contribution Profit" under the
section of the Earn-Out Plan entitled "Change Control View" (as it may be
adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.9(i)_ ) for any single quarter, then
Parent shall be entitled to manage all aspects of the operations of the Earn-
Out Operating Unit in its sole and absolute discretion, including removing Mr.
Ernstrom from the management of the Earn-Out Operating Unit, and without
regard to whether the Earn-Out Operating Unit achieves the target
Contribution Profit levels identified on the Earn-Out Operating Plan.



(iii) _Termination Based On Cause or Voluntary Termination_. In the event that
(x) Parent shall remove Mr. Ernstrom from the management of the Earn-Out
Operating Unit for "cause," or (y) Mr. Ernstrom shall voluntarily resign from
the Earn-Out Operating Unit for whatever reason, then Parent shall be entitled
to manage all aspects of the operations of the Earn-Out Operating Unit in its
sole and absolute discretion and without regard to whether the Earn-Out
Operating Unit achieves the target Contribution Profit levels identified on
the Earn-Out Operating Plan. For purposes of this Agreement, " _cause_ " is
defined as (A) a failure to perform his assigned duties or responsibilities
to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent; (B) Mr. Ernstrom engaging in any act
of dishonesty, fraud or misrepresentation; (C) Mr. Ernstroms violation of any
federal or state law or regulation applicable to Parents business or the
Earn-Out Operating Unit; (D) Mr. Ernstroms material breach of any
confidentiality agreement or invention assignment agreement between Mr.
Ernstrom and Parent or the Surviving Corporation; (E) Mr. Ernstrom being
convicted of, or entering a plea of _nolo contendere_ to, any felony or
committing any act of moral turpitude; (F) Mr. Ernstrom committing an act with
the intention of adversely affecting the reputation or business of Parent or
one of its affiliates; (G) Mr. Ernstrom knowingly disparaging Parent or one of
its affiliates, its or their respective business, products, services, and/or
officers or directors; (H) Mr. Ernstrom causing Earn-Out Product to
be promoted, advertised, marketed or sold in a manner that is detrimental to
Parent or its business and products other than Earn-Out Products; or (I) Mr.
Ernstrom violating any material Parent employment policy.



 

-25- (h) _Termination Based On Other Reasons_. In the event that Parent shall
remove Mr. Ernstrom from the management of the Earn-Out Operating Unit or
otherwise assume the management of the operations of the Earn-Out Operating
Unit for any reason other than as provided in paragraphs (i), (ii) or (iii) of
_Section 1.9(g)_ (a " _Discretionary Termination_ "), then within ten (10)
days after the date of such Discretionary Termination Parent shall pay to the
Payment Agent an amount equal to the sum of (i) any Earn-Out payments earned
and payable prior to the date of such Discretionary Termination for the
tranche period in which such Discretionary Termination occurred, (ii) fifty
percent (50%) the maximum amount of Earn-Out Payments potentially payable
hereunder with respect to the remainder of such tranche period following the
date of such Discretionary Termination and, (iii) if such Discretionary
Termination occurs in the First Tranche Period, fifty percent (50%) the
maximum amount of Earn-Out Payments potentially payable hereunder
with respect to the Second Tranche Period. For purposes of the foregoing, (i)
the Earn-Out Payments earned and payable prior to the date of such
Discretionary Termination for the tranche period in which such Discretionary
Termination occurred shall be determined by pro-rating the Earn-Out Metrics
for such tranche period by the portion of such tranche period occurring prior
to the date of such Discretionary Termination and applying such pro-rated
Earn-Out Metrics to the Gross Profit realized during such portion of the
applicable tranche period, and (ii) the maximum amount of Earn-Out Payments
potentially payable hereunder with respect to the remainder of such tranche
period following the date of such Discretionary Termination shall
be determined by pro-rating the maximum payout for such tranche period by the
portion of such period following the date of such Discretionary Termination.
Any such portion of the Earn-Out Payments to which the former Company
Stockholders shall be entitled shall be immediately paid by the Payment Agent
by check delivered to the addresses of the former Company Stockholders
entitled thereto. Any such payment shall be credited against any future
obligation that Parent may have to pay any Earn-Out Payment pursuant to
_Section 1.9(a)_ hereof.



(i)  _Termination of Web Hosted Services_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion
to terminate the provision of web hosted services relating to Earn-Out
Products at any time. In the event that Parent shall elect to terminate the
provision of such web hosted services, it shall notify the Stockholder
Representative in writing of its decision and of the effective date of such
election (the " _Hosting Termination Date_ "). Effective as of the Hosting
Termination Date, the Earn-Out Operating Plan and the Earn-Out Metrics for the
remainder of such tranche period following the Hosting Termination Date shall
be adjusted as follows:



(i) Actual Net Sales attributable to web hosted services for the full quarter
ending immediately prior to the Hosting Termination Date shall be divided by
the Net Sales set forth in the section of the Earn-Out Operating Plan entitled
"Web Hosted Services Adjustments" for such quarter to determine the "
_Hosting Adjustment Factor_ ";



 

-26- (ii) Gross Profit for the remainder of such tranche period following the
Hosting Termination Date (based on the Gross Profit set forth in the section
of the Earn-Out Operating Plan entitled "Web Hosted Services Adjustments" for
each quarter ending after the Hosting Termination Date, and pro-rated for the
quarter in which the Hosting Termination Date occurs), shall be multiplied by
the Hosting Adjustment Factor to determine the " _Adjusted Hosting Gross
Profit_ ";



(iii) The Adjusted Hosting Gross Profit shall be subtracted from the floor and
ceiling applicable such tranche period to determine the revised floor
and ceiling applicable to such tranche period;



(iv) In the event that the Hosting Termination Date occurs in the First
Tranche Period, the Second Tranche Floor and Second Tranche Ceiling shall be
adjusted by multiplying $1,890,000 by the Hosting Adjustment Factor to
determine the _"Second Tranche Adjusted Hosting Gross Profit_ ," and the
Second Tranche Adjusted Hosting Gross Profit shall be subtracted from the
Second Tranche Floor and Second Tranche Ceiling to determine the revised
Second Tranche Floor and Second Tranche Ceiling; and 



(v) All other amounts in the Earn-Out Operating Plan for each quarter ending
after the Hosting Termination Date, and pro-rated for the quarter in which the
Hosting Termination Date occurs, shall be adjusted by multiplying the
applicable amount set forth in the section of the Earn-Out Operating Plan
entitled "Web Hosted Services Adjustments" by the Hosting Adjustment Factor,
and subtracting such amount from the corresponding amount set forth in the
sections of the Earn-Out Operating Plan entitled "Earn-Out View,"
"Threshold View" and "Change Control View," and the amounts in the Earn-Out
Operating Plan on the line entitled "Cumulative Threshold Contribution Profit"
under the section of the Earn-Out Plan entitled "Threshold View" shall be
recalculated consistent with the foregoing.



Any adjustments made pursuant to this _Section 1.9(i)_ shall act to adjust
the entirety of _Section 1.9_ after Hosting Termination Date.



(j) _Company Acknowledgement_. The Company acknowledges that except as
provided in _Section 1.9(g)_ , (i) Parent and its designees to the board of
directors of the Surviving Corporation will have the power and right to
control all aspects of the business and operations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation; (ii) Parent and its designees to the board of directors of the
Surviving Corporation may exercise or refrain from exercising such power and
right as they may deem appropriate and in the best overall interests of Parent
and its subsidiaries as a whole (rather than the interests of the former
Company Stockholders in the Earn-Out Payments); (iii) Parent currently has,
and may in the future develop or acquire, products that compete, either
directly or indirectly, with the Earn-Out Products and may make decisions with
respect to such products that adversely effect the Earn-Out Products or Gross
Profit; and (iv) any of the above actions may reduce the former Company
Stockholders ability to receive any Earn-Out Payment  



 

-27-  pursuant to this _Section 1.9_ ; _provided_ , that in each case the board of
directors of Parent shall act consistent with its fiduciary duties and in
good faith and Parent shall not take any action the purpose of which is to
reduce or eliminate the Earn-Out Payment obligations provided for by this
_Section 1.9_.



1.10 _Adjustment to Parent Common Stock_. All references to Parent Common
Stock contained herein (other than references to Parent Common Stock being
valued only at a particular point in time) shall be adjusted to reflect fully
the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to
Parent Common Stock after the date hereof.

subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation to the continued use and possession

premises in a good and workmanlike manner and otherwise in accordance with the
Lease Agreements.



 

-39- (e) The Company has not received any notice from any insurance company of any
defects or inadequacies in any Leased Real Property or any part thereof which
could materially and adversely affect the insurability of such Leased Real
Property or the premiums for the insurance thereof. No notice has been given
to the Company by any insurance company which has issued a policy with
respect to any portion of any Leased Real Property or by any board of fire
underwriters (or other body exercising similar functions) requesting the
performance of any repairs, alterations or other work with which
compliance has not been made. To the Companys Knowledge, there exist no
structural, soil or other conditions with respect to any Leased Real Property
that could increase the probability of material damage to any Leased Real
Property as a result of earthquake or other seismic activity. In addition, no
structural, soil or other conditions with respect to any Leased Real Property
have adversely affected or, to the Companys Knowledge, threaten to adversely
affect, the use, occupancy or operation of any Leased Real Property.



(f) No law, ordinance, regulation or restriction is, or as of the Closing
Date will be, violated by the continued occupancy, maintenance, operation or
use of any Leased Real Property in its present manner. To the Companys
Knowledge, there are no laws, statutes, rules, regulations or orders by any
Governmental Entity which could require the Company or any of its subsidiaries
to make any expenditure in excess of $25,000 to modify or improve such Leased
Real Property to bring it into compliance therewith. 



(g) There is no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened
condemnation or similar proceeding affecting any Leased Real Property or any
portion thereof, and the Company has no Knowledge that any such action is
currently contemplated. There are no legal actions, suits or other legal
administrative proceedings pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened
against the Company or any third parties affecting any Leased Real Property,
and the Company is not aware of any facts which might result in any such
action, suit or proceeding.

in the case of leased properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all
of its tangible properties and assets, real, personal and mixed, used or held
for use in its business, free and clear of any Liens, except (i) as reflected
in the Current Balance Sheet, (ii) Liens for Taxes and other governmental
charges and assessments not yet due and payable, (iii) Liens of landlords and
Liens of carriers, warehousemen, mechanics and materialmen and other like
Liens, and (iv) such imperfections of title and encumbrances, if any, which
do not materially detract from the value or interfere with the present use of
the property subject thereto or affected thereby.

Company Employee Plan; (vi) all IRS determination, opinion, notification and
advisory letters, and all applications and correspondence to or from the IRS
or the DOL with respect to any such application or letter; (vii) all
communications material to any Employee or Employees relating to any Company

(d) _Employee Plan Compliance_. The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have
performed in all material respects all obligations required to be
performed by them under, are not in default or violation of, and have no
Knowledge of any default or violation by any other party to each Company
Employee Plan, and each Company Employee Plan has been established and
maintained in all material respects in accordance with its terms and in
compliance with all applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules and regulations,
including ERISA or the Code. Any Company Employee Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust intended to qualify
under Section 501(a) of the Code (i) has either applied for, prior to the
expiration of the requisite period under applicable Treasury Regulations or
IRS pronouncements, or obtained a favorable determination, notification,
advisory and/or opinion letter, as applicable, as to its qualified status
from the IRS or still has a remaining period of time  



 

-53-  under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to
apply for such letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination, and (ii) incorporates or has been amended to
incorporate all provisions required to comply with the Tax Reform Act of 1986
and subsequent legislation. For each Company Employee Plan that is intended to

condition or circumstance that has adversely affected or is likely to
adversely affect such qualified status. No "prohibited transaction," within
the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and
not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to
any Company Employee Plan. As of the date hereof, there are no actions, suits
or claims pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or
reasonably anticipated (other than routine claims for benefits) against any
Company Employee Plan or against the assets of any Company Employee Plan. Each
Company Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued
after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms, without liability to
Parent, Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary
administration expenses). As of the date hereof, there are no audits,
inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company or any
ERISA Affiliates, threatened by the IRS or DOL, or any other Governmental
Entity with respect to any Company Employee Plan. Neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate is subject to any penalty or tax with respect to any Company
Employee Plan under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975 through 4980 of
the Code. The Company and each ERISA Affiliate have timely made all
contributions and other payments required by and due under the terms of each
Company Employee Plan.



(e) _No Pension or Welfare Plans_. Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or
contributed to, any (i) Pension Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, (ii) Multiemployer Plan, (iii) "multiple employer
plan" as defined in ERISA or the Code, or (iv) a "funded welfare plan" within
the meaning of Section 419 of the Code. No Company Employee Plan provides
health benefits that are not fully insured through an insurance contract. 



(f) _No Post-Employment Obligations_. No Company Employee Plan provides, or
reflects or represents any liability to provide post-termination or retiree
welfare benefits to any person for any reason, except as may be required by
COBRA or other applicable statute, and neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate has ever represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral
or written form) to any Employee (either individually or to Employees as a
group) or any other person that such Employee(s) or other person would be
provided with post-termination or retiree welfare benefits, except to the
extent required by statute.



(g) _Health Care Compliance_. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has,
prior to the Effective Time and in any material respect, violated any of the
health care continuation requirements of COBRA, the requirements of FMLA, the
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996, the  



 

-54-  requirements of the Womens Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, the
requirements of the Newborns and Mothers Health Protection Act of 1996, or
any amendment to each such act, or any similar provisions of state law
applicable to its Employees.



(h) _Past Acquisitions_. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is
currently obligated to provide an Employee with any compensation or
benefits pursuant to an acquisition agreement with a former employer of such
Employee.



(i) _Effect of Transaction_. The execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (either alone or
upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an
event under any Company Employee Plan, Employee Agreement, trust or loan that
will or may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase
in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Employee.



(j) _Employment Matters_. The Company: (i) is in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws, rules and
regulations respecting employment, employment practices, terms and conditions
of employment and wages and hours, in each case, with respect to Employees;
(ii) has withheld and reported all amounts required by law or by agreement to
be withheld and reported with respect to wages, salaries and other payments to
Employees; (iii) is not liable for any arrears of wages or any taxes or any
penalty for failure to comply with any of the foregoing; and (iv) is not
liable for any payment to any trust or other fund governed by or maintained by
or on behalf of any Governmental Entity, with respect to unemployment
compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or obligations for
Employees (other than routine payments to be made in the normal course of
business and consistent with past practice). There are no pending, threatened
or reasonably anticipated claims or actions against the Company under any
workers compensation policy or long-term disability policy. Neither the
Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has direct or indirect liability with respect
to any misclassification of any person as an independent contractor rather
than as an employee, or with respect to any employee leased from another
employer, except as would not result in material harm to the Company.



(k) _Labor_. No work stoppage or labor strike against the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate is pending, threatened or reasonably anticipated. The
Company does not know of any activities or proceedings of any labor union to
organize any Employees. There are no actions, suits, claims, labor disputes or
grievances pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or
reasonably anticipated relating to any labor, safety or discrimination matters
involving any Employee, including, without limitation, charges of unfair labor
practices or discrimination complaints, which, if adversely determined,
would, individually or in the aggregate, result in any material liability to
the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has engaged in
any unfair labor practices within the meaning of the National Labor Relations
Act. The Company is not presently, nor has it been in the past, a party to, or
bound by, any  



 

-55-  collective bargaining agreement or union contract with respect to Employees
and no collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated with respect
to Employees. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries have incurred
any material liability or material obligation under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act or any similar state or local law which remains
unsatisfied. 



(l) _International Employee Plan_. Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate currently, nor has it ever had the obligation to, maintain,
establish, sponsor, participate in, or contribute to any International
Employee Plan.



2.23 _Insurance_. _Section 2.23_ of the Disclosure Schedule lists all
insurance policies and fidelity bonds covering the assets, business,
equipment, properties, operations, employees, officers and directors of the
Company, the Companys subsidiaries or any affiliate. There is no claim by the
Company, any of its subsidiaries or any affiliate pending under any of such
policies or bonds as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed
by the underwriters of such policies or bonds. All premiums due and payable
under all such policies and bonds have been paid, and the Company and
its affiliates are otherwise in material compliance with the terms of such
policies and bonds (or other policies and bonds providing substantially
similar insurance coverage). The Company has no Knowledge of threatened
termination of, or premium increase with respect to, any of such policies.



2.24  _Compliance with Laws_. The Company and each of its subsidiaries are in
material compliance with, and have not received any notices of any pending
violation with respect to, any foreign, federal, state or local statute, law
or regulation, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as
amended, and the rules or regulations thereunder.

terms and conditions of sale, subscription, license or lease for each of the
products or technology sold or services rendered by the Company or its
subsidiaries and copies of the Companys standard forms of sale agreements and
services agreements. No such product, technology or service rendered is
subject to any warranty or other indemnity beyond the applicable standard
terms and conditions of sale, license or lease or beyond that implied or
imposed by applicable law.



 

2.26 _Complete Copies of Materials_. The Company has delivered or made
available true and complete copies of each document (or summaries of
same) that has been requested by Parent or its counsel.



2.27  _Information Statement Disclosure_. None of the information about the

to be delivered to Company Stockholders or holders of Company Options or
Company Warrants will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order

Company Stockholders pursuant to an Action by Written Consent signed by each
officer of the Company, each member of the Companys Board of Directors (and
any affiliated entities) in his, her or its capacity as a Company
Stockholder, and certain other Company Stockholders all of whom collectively
hold at least a majority of (i) the outstanding shares of Company Capital
Stock voting as a single class, and (ii) the Company Series B Preferred Stock
voting as a separate class, pursuant to and in accordance with the applicable
provisions of Delaware Law and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Company. Such approval shall also include and constitute (A)
the irrevocable approval by such Company Stockholders of the escrow and
indemnification obligations set forth in _Article VII_ and the deposit of the
Escrow Amount into the Escrow Fund and (B) the appointment of Mark Soane as
the Stockholder Representative.



(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall circulate an information statement (the " _Information
Statement_ ") to each Company Stockholder whose consent was not obtained
immediately following the execution of this Agreement, informing such Company
Stockholders of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger,
which Information Statement shall be in a form that complies with Section 262
of Delaware Law, and the Company shall submit this Agreement, the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including each of the matters set forth
in _Section 5.1(a)_ , to all such remaining Company Stockholders for adoption
and approval by written consent pursuant to the Action by Written Consent, as
provided by Delaware Law and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Company. The record date for such consent and for purposes of determining
shareholders entitled to notice of appraisal rights pursuant to
Section 262(d)(2) of Delaware Law shall be the date of this Agreement to the
extent permitted by Delaware Law. The Information Statement shall specify that
adoption of this Agreement shall constitute approval by the Company
Stockholders of: (A) the escrow and indemnification obligations set forth in
_Article VII_ and the deposit of the Escrow Amount into the Escrow Fund and
(B) the appointment of Mark Soane as Stockholder Representative. The Company
shall give the Company Stockholders who hold shares of Company Capital Stock
on the record date set forth above, and the holders of Company Options and
Company Warrants who may exercise such Company Options or Company Warrants and
become Company Stockholders during such notice period, sufficient notice
prior to the Closing such that no Company Stockholder will be able to exercise
appraisal rights if such Company Stockholder has not taken affirmative action
to preserve such appraisal rights prior to Closing, pursuant to Section 262
of Delaware Law.



 

-63- The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Company
Stockholders holding no more than ten percent (10%) of the Total Outstanding

the Company Stockholders by the requisite vote or the consent thereof in lieu
of a formal meeting any payments of cash or stock or other benefits arising
out of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that may be deemed to constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section
280G of the Code, such that if such vote were obtained all such payments
resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby shall not be deemed to be
"parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code or shall be exempt
from such treatment under such Section 280G (the " _280G Approval_ "), or (ii)
deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent that, as a
consequence of the failure to obtain the 280G Approval, such "parachute
payment" shall not be made or provided (the " _280G Forfeiture_ "). If neither
the 280G Approval nor the 280G Forfeiture is obtained prior to the Closing,
the Upfront Consideration shall be adjusted by the 280G Adjustment Amount.

Approval. Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding,

inclusion. Each of the Company and Parent will promptly advise the other in
writing if at any time prior to the completion of the solicitation of written
consents such party shall obtain knowledge of any facts that make it necessary
to amend or supplement the Soliciting Materials in order to make statements
contained or incorporated by reference therein not misleading or to comply
with applicable law. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not alter,
modify, change or revoke its unanimous approval of this Agreement, the Merger

forth in _Section 5.1(a)_ hereof and if required pursuant to _Section 5.1(b)_
, the 280G Approval, and its unanimous recommendation to the Stockholders to

hereby, including each of the matters set forth in _Section 5.1(a)_ hereof and

date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of _Section
8.1_ , the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consents, waivers and approvals under any of the Contracts to which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party that are reasonably necessary
to be obtained in connection with the Merger, including all consents, waivers

and approvals and to effect all necessary registrations and filings and to
remove any injunctions or other impediments or delays, legal or otherwise, in
order to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for the purpose of securing to the parties hereto the benefits
contemplated by this Agreement. If any administrative, judicial or legislative
action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging the Merger or any other transaction provided for in this
Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law (as defined below), the Company
and Parent shall each reasonably cooperate to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents, or prohibits
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions, including without
limitation, by pursuing all reasonable avenues of administrative and judicial
appeal; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required to (i)
agree to any divestiture by Parent or the Company or any of Parents
subsidiaries or affiliates, of shares of capital stock or of any business,

take any action under this _Section 5.8_ if any Governmental Entity that has
the authority to enforce any Antitrust Law seeks, or authorizes its staff to

the Merger. As soon as may be reasonably practicable, to the extent not
already filed, each of the Company and Parent shall file with the United
States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of
the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the Notification and
Report Forms relating to the transactions contemplated herein as required by
the HSR Act, as well as comparable pre-merger notification forms required by
the merger notification or control laws and regulations of applicable
jurisdiction, as agreed to by the parties. The Company and Parent each shall
promptly (a) supply the other with any information which may be required in
order to effectuate such filings, (b) supply any additional information which
reasonably may be required by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger
control authorities of any other jurisdiction and which the parties may
reasonably deem appropriate, and (c) promptly inform the other party of any
material communication received by such party from the Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any
other governmental or regulatory authority regarding the Merger and any other
transaction provided for in this Agreement. Parent shall be entitled to direct
any proceedings or negotiations with any Governmental Entity relating to any
of the foregoing,  _provided_ that it shall afford the Company a reasonable
opportunity to participate therein. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Antitrust Law_ " shall mean the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, the EC
Merger Regulations and all other federal, and state statutes, rules,
regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines, and other
laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade.



5.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent of: (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence
or non-occurrence of which would cause or has caused any representation or
warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect at or prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) any
failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, which
in the case of either clause (i) or clause (ii) would reasonably be expected
to result in any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ to not be
satisfied as a result, individually or collectively, of any of the foregoing
matters. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.9_ shall not
(a) limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the party receiving
such notice or (b) constitute an acknowledgment or admission of a breach of
this Agreement. No disclosure by the Company pursuant to this _Section 5.9_ ,
however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule or
prevent or cure any misrepresentations, breach of warranty or breach of
covenant.



 

-67- 5.10 _Additional Documents and Further Assurances_. Each party hereto, at the
request of another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other
instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be reasonably
necessary or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby.



5.11 _S-8 Registration_. As promptly as practicable (and in any event not
more than 15 days) after the Closing Date, Parent agrees to file, to the
extent available for use by Parent, with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 registering that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
Assumed Options assumed by Parent pursuant to _Section 1.6(d)_.



5.12 _New Employment Arrangements_. At the discretion of Parent, each person
who is a U.S. employee of the Company or its subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Closing Date shall be offered "at-will" employment by Parent and/or the
Surviving Corporation, to be effective as of the Closing Date, upon proof of
citizenship or appropriate employment authorization from the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service or the U.S. Department of State
evidencing a right to work in the United States. Such "at-will" employment
arrangements will (i) be set forth in offer letters based on Parents standard
form (each, an " _Offer Letter_ "), (ii) be subject to and in compliance with
Parents applicable human resources policies and procedures, (iii) have terms,
including the position, salary and responsibilities of such employee, which
will be determined by Parent after consultation with the Companys
management, and (iv) supersede any prior employment agreements and other
arrangements with such employee in effect prior to the Closing Date. At the
discretion of Parent, each person who is a non-U.S. employee of the Company
or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be offered
employment under terms similar to the ones above but consistent with the laws
of the relevant jurisdiction. Each employee listed on  _Schedule 5.12_ (a "
_Key Employee_ ") shall execute an Offer Letter, which Offer Letters shall be
effective as of the Closing Date. Each employee of the Company who remains an
employee of Parent or the Surviving Corporation after the Closing Date shall
be referred to hereafter as a " _Continuing Employee_." Continuing Employees
shall be eligible to receive benefits consistent with Parents applicable
human resources policies and comparable to similarly situated employees at
Parent to the extent such Continuing Employee are eligible. In furtherance of
the foregoing, the Company shall terminate all employment agreements and other
severance arrangements with its employees other than the Companys
Proprietary Information Agreements and the Employment Agreement dated January
1, 2002 between the Company and Gary Gatchell and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to terminate any other employment-related
agreements specified in writing by Parent effective as of the Closing Date or
such later date as is specified by Parent. For vesting and eligibility under
any Parent 401(k) plan for which a Continuing Employee becomes eligible after
the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company before the Effective Time. After the
Effective Time, each Continuing Employee shall receive credit for future
vacation accruals under  



 

-68-  Parent vacation policies for years of service with the Company prior to the
Effective Time. With respect to any employees of the Company whose employment
had not terminated prior to the Closing and who were eligible to receive
bonus payments under the terms of the Companys 2003 Bonus Plan (the " _2003
Bonus Plan_ "), Parent agrees to pay any accrued bonuses under such 2003 Bonus
Plan to such employees if such employee remained employed by the Company
through December 31, 2003.



5.13 _Termination of Certain Benefit Plans_. Effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company and its subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall each terminate any and all group severance, separation or
salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements and any and all plans
intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (unless Parent provides
written notice to the Company that such 401(k) plans shall not be terminated)
(collectively, " _Terminated Company Employee Plans_ "). Unless Parent
provides such written notice to the Company, no later than five business days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with
evidence that such Company Employee Plan(s) have been terminated (effective
as of the day immediately terminated preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to
resolutions of the Companys Board of Directors. The form and substance of
such resolutions shall be subject to review and reasonable approval of
Parent. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating such Terminated Company Employee Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably
require.



5.14 _Company Warrants_.



(a) The Company shall take all necessary actions (including providing
all required notices and obtaining any required consents) to ensure that all
outstanding Company Warrants are treated as set forth in this _Section 5.14_.
In the case of any holder of a Company Warrant, the parties shall take steps
to enable the holder thereof to exercise the Company Warrant as of the
Effective Time on a basis that enables the holder effectively to participate
in receiving the Merger Consideration by allowing the holder to pay such
holders exercise price in full or in part through an offset to the portion
of the Merger Consideration that would otherwise be payable to such holder
pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_ had such holder delivered a check for the full
exercise price of such Company Warrant (net of such holders Pro Rata Escrow
Portion). Each holder of a Company Warrant who exercises or is deemed to
exercise such holders Company Warrant in the manner described above shall be
entitled at the Effective Time to receive the same amount of Merger
Consideration that would otherwise be payable to a holder of the full number
of shares of Company Capital Stock to which such holder would have been
entitled had such holder delivered a check for the full exercise price of such
Company Warrant, without taking into account any such offset. The
distributions of cash to be distributed to Company Warrantholders pursuant to
this _Section 5.14_ shall be reduced pursuant to _Article VII_ hereof.



(b) Any Company Warrant which is not exercised pursuant to _Section 5.14(a)_
by the Effective Time but whose holder would be entitled to a cash  



 

-69-  distribution pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_ if such holder had exercised such
warrant (after giving effect to any offset to the Common Exchange Price
for the exercise price and such holders Pro Rata Escrow Portion) shall
pursuant to its terms be automatically terminated and extinguished immediately
prior to the Effective Time and in exchange such Company Warrantholder shall
receive the Merger Consideration to which such holder would have otherwise
been entitled had such Company Warrant actually been exercised reduced by the
exercise price of each share of Company Capital Stock underlying such Company
Warrant. For purposes of clarity, the shares of Company Capital Stock
underlying Company Warrants that are converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 5.14_ shall be deemed to be
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for purposes
of determining Total Outstanding Shares.



5.15 _Indemnification and Insurance_.



(a) Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and
honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to (i) each
indemnification agreement listed in _Section 5.15_ of the Disclosure Schedule
in effect between the Company and each person who is a director or officer of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries at the Effective Time and (ii) any
indemnification provision under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or
equivalent organizational documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the persons to be indemnified
pursuant to the agreements and provisions referred to in clauses (i) and (ii)
of this _Section 5.15(a)_ shall be referred to as, collectively, the "
_Company Indemnified Parties_ "). The certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions with respect to
indemnification and exculpation from liability substantially similar to those
set forth in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as in
effect immediately after the Effective Time, a copy of which has been provided
to the Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time in any manner
that would materially adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Company
Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent reserves the right
to merge the Surviving Corporation into Parent or another wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent at any point for legitimate corporate purposes.



(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company may purchase, for the benefit of all
officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, policies of directors and officers and fiduciary liability
"tail" or "run-off" insurance providing for such coverage as the Company may
determine in its sole discretion prior to the Closing, for an aggregate net
policy cost of not to exceed $50,000.



5.16 _Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement_. The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each employee
and contractor of the Company and its subsidiaries who has not previously
entered into the Companys standard proprietary information and inventions
assignment agreement to enter into and execute such a proprietary information
and inventions assignment agreement with the Company prior to the Closing. 



 

-70- 5.17 _Spreadsheet_. The Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent and the
Payment Agent prior to the Closing a spreadsheet in substantially the form
attached as _Schedule 5.17_ which shall list, as of the Closing, all Company
Stockholders, Company Optionholders and Company Warrantholders and their
respective addresses, the number of shares of Company Capital Stock, Company
Options or Company Warrants held by such persons, and, in the case of Company
Options or Company Warrants, the exercise prices thereof, the cash
consideration to be issued to (or Assumed Options held by) each holder, the
amount to be deposited into the Escrow Fund on behalf of each Company
Stockholder, and such other information relevant thereto or which Parent or
the Payment Agent may reasonably request (the " _Spreadsheet_ ").

 



5.18 _Stock Options_.



(a) _Stock Options_.



(i) Except as provided in _Sections 5.18(b)_ and _(c)_ , immediately prior to
the Effective Time each outstanding Company Option other than Assumed Options
(each, a " _Terminated Option_ ") under the Option Plans shall terminate. The
Company shall take all necessary actions (including providing all required
notices and obtaining any required consents) to ensure that all outstanding
Terminated Options, including any Exchange Options which are not Assumed
Options, are terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the
case of any holder of a Terminated Option, the parties shall take steps to
enable the holder thereof to exercise the option as of the Effective Time
(including any portion thereof that becomes exercisable in connection with the
Merger) on a basis that enables the holder effectively to participate in
receiving the Merger Consideration by allowing the holder to pay such holders
exercise price in full or in part through delivering an exercise notice to the
Company prior to the Closing Date which provides for an offset to the portion
of the Merger Consideration that would otherwise be payable to such holder
pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_ had such holder delivered a check for the full
exercise price of such Terminated Option (net of such holders Pro Rata
Escrow Portion). Each holder of a Terminated Option who exercises or is deemed
to exercise such holders Terminated Option in the manner described above
shall be entitled at the Effective Time to receive the same amount of Merger
Consideration that would otherwise be payable to a holder of the full number
of shares of Company Common Stock to which such holder would have been
entitled had such holder delivered a check for the full exercise price of
such Terminated Option. Any amount still owed by any such holder for the
exercise price of any such option after such offset (including such holders
Pro Rata Escrow Portion) must be paid to the Company prior to the Effective
Time. The distributions of cash to be distributed to Company Optionholders
who become Company Stockholders pursuant to this _Section 5.18(a)(i)_ or
_Section 5.18(b)(ii)_ shall be reduced pursuant to _Article VII_.



 

-71- (ii) Any Terminated Option that is not exercised pursuant to _Section
5.18(a)(i)_ prior to the Effective Time but whose holder would be entitled to
a cash distribution pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_ if such holder had exercised
such Terminated Option (after giving effect to any offset to the Common
Exchange Price for the exercise price of such Terminated Option and such
holders Pro Rata Escrow Portion) shall be automatically be deemed to be
exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time without any action on the
part of the holder of such Terminated Option, and such holder shall thereupon
become entitled to the Merger Consideration to which such holder would have
otherwise been entitled had such Terminated Option actually been exercised
reduced by the exercise price of each share of Company Common Stock
underlying such Terminated Option. For purposes of clarity, the shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Terminated Options that are
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
5.18(a)_ shall be deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time for purposes of determining Total Outstanding Shares.



(b) _Amendment to Company s 2000 Equity Incentive Plan; New Options, and
Assumption of New Options_.



(i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to amend the Companys 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and form of
option agreement thereunder to increase the number of shares of Company Common
Stock reserved for issuance thereunder to provide for the issuance of the New
Options and provide that with respect to the grant of New Options: (a) the
exercisability of such New Options shall not accelerate directly or indirectly
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger or any actual or constructive termination of employment following the
Merger, (b) in connection with this Agreement, such New Options shall be
assumed by Parent in accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.6(d)_ , and
(c) the holders of such New Options shall not in their respective capacities
as such be entitled to receive any portion of any Earn-Out Payments. Parent
shall take all corporate actions necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery pursuant to
the terms set forth in this _Section 5.18(b)(i)_.



(ii) On the Closing Date but prior to the Closing, the Company shall grant
the New Options in such numbers and pursuant to such terms and conditions as
shall be directed by Parent at least five (5) business days prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the exercise price of such New
Options shall be equal to the Common Exchange Price (without giving effect to
any anticipated Working Capital Deficit); and _provided further_ , that the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
New Options shall not exceed the quotient obtained by dividing (i) One Million
Three Hundred Thousand (1,300,000) by (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio.



(iii) At the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent shall assume such
New Options as set forth in _Section 1.6(d)_.



 

-72- (c) _Option Exchange Program_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
issue the Exchange Options in accordance with the Option Exchange Program;
_provided, however_ , that the exercise price of such Exchange Options shall
be not less than the Common Exchange Price anticipated as of such date
(without giving effect to any anticipated Working Capital Deficit). In
conjunction with the issuance of each Exchange Option, the Company shall give
each holder an amendment to such holders existing option agreement (the "
_Option Agreement_ ") in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent. The
amendment shall provide that (a) the holder of the Exchange Option
acknowledges and accepts that the Exchange Option is upon different terms than
those of the initial grant, (b) the exercisability of such Exchange
Options shall not accelerate directly or indirectly as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger or any
actual or constructive termination of employment following the Merger, (c) in
connection with this Agreement, such Exchange Options shall be assumed by
Parent in accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.6(d)_ , and (d) the
holders of such Exchange Options shall not in their respective capacities as
such be entitled to receive any portion of any Earn-Out Payments. Each holder
who executes and returns an amendment to an Option Agreement by the date which
is five days prior to the Effective Time shall receive an Exchange Option and
such Exchange Option shall be assumed as set forth in  _Section 1.6(d)_. All
other holders of Exchange Options shall hold Terminated Options and shall be
treated as set forth in _Section 5.18(a)_.

_ARTICLE VII_



_SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ESCROW_



7.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement, or
in any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement,
shall survive until March 31, 2005 (the " _Survival Date_ "); _provided,
however,_ that the representations and warranties contained in _Section 2.2_
 (Company Capital Structure), _Section 2.10_ (Tax Matters) and _Section 2.13_
(Intellectual Property) (collectively, the " _Specified Representations_ ")
shall survive until March 31, 2006. Without limiting the provisions of 
_Section 1.9_ or any other provision that imposes obligations upon Parent or
the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time, the representations
and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement, or in any
certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall
terminate at the Closing.



7.2 _Indemnification_. The Escrow Fund and the unpaid Earn-Out Payments (to
the extent provided in _Section 7.5_ ) are available to indemnify and hold
Parent and its officers, directors and affiliates, including the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), harmless against any and all
claims, losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, diminution in value, costs
and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and  



 

-77-  expenses of investigation and defense (hereinafter individually a " _Loss_ "
and collectively " _Losses_ ") incurred or sustained by the Indemnified
Parties, or any of them (including the Surviving Corporation), directly or
indirectly, as a result of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or
warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate, instrument, or other document delivered by the Company prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) any failure by the Company
to perform or comply with any covenant required to be performed by it prior to
the Effective Time contained in this Agreement, (iii) any payments for
Dissenting Shares pursuant to _Section 1.7_ in excess of (X) the Common
Exchange Price (in the case of shares of Company Common Stock) or (Y) the sum
of $.10 plus the Common Exchange Price (in the case of shares of Company
Series A Preferred Stock) (" _Dissenting Share Payments_ ") and any claims in
respect thereof, (iv) any amount by which the Working Capital Deficit as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 7.7(b)_  reflects a Working Capital
Deficit that is greater than the Working Capital Deficit reflected in the
Closing Date Working Capital Statement, (v) any amount by which Third Party
Expenses exceeds the greater of Estimated Third Party Expenses or $1,750,000,
or (vi) the matters set forth on _Schedule 7.2_ hereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any amount which is taken into account in calculating the Working
Capital Deficit shall not also be taken into account in calculating the
amount of any Loss pursuant to this _Section 7.2,_ any amount which is taken
into account in calculating the amount of any Loss pursuant to clause (v) of
this _Section 7.2_ shall not also be taken into account in calculating the
amount of any Loss pursuant to clause (iv) of this _Section 7.2_ and any
amount which is taken into account in calculating the amount of any Loss
pursuant to clauses (iv) of this _Section 7.2_ shall not also be taken into
account in calculating the amount of any Loss pursuant to clause (i) of this
_Section 7.2_. For the purpose of this _Article VII_ only, when determining
the amount of any Loss attributable to a breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty of the Company, but not for determining whether
any such breach or inaccuracy has occurred, any representation or warranty
given or made by the Company that is qualified in scope as to materiality
(including Material Adverse Effect) shall be deemed to be made or given
without such qualification. The Company Stockholders shall not have any right
of contribution from the Company or Parent with respect to any Loss claimed by
an Indemnified Party.



7.3 _Escrow Arrangements_.



(a) _Escrow Fund_. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby by the
Company Stockholders, and as partial security for the indemnity provided for
in _Section 7.2_ , at the Effective Time, the Company Stockholders will be
deemed to have received and deposited with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount
without any act of any Company Stockholder. The Escrow Amount shall be
available to compensate the Indemnified Parties for any claims by such parties
for any Losses incurred or sustained by them and for which they are entitled
to recovery under this _Article VII_ ;  _provided, however_ , that the Sales
Tax Escrow Amount shall only be available to compensate the Indemnified
Parties for claims by such parties for any Losses described in _Schedule 7.2_.
The Escrow Amount  



 

-78-  shall constitute an escrow fund (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") to be governed by
the terms set forth herein. The Escrow Agent may execute this Agreement
following the date hereof and prior to the Closing, and such later execution,
if so executed after the date hereof, shall not affect the binding nature of
this Agreement as of the date hereof between the other signatories hereto.
Any income, gains, losses and expenses of the Escrow Fund shall be included
by Parent as taxable income or loss of Parent, and any income and gains of the
Escrow Fund shall be available to Parent as part of the Escrow Fund, but if
not paid to Parent in connection with an indemnification claim in accordance
with the terms hereof shall ultimately be distributable to the former Company
Stockholders in the same manner as any other payment to them from the Escrow
Fund. Within ten (10) business days following the end of each calendar
quarter, Parent shall be entitled to a disbursement of 2% of the income and
gains (net of any expenses and losses) earned for such quarter on the Escrow
Fund.



(b) _Threshold_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, the Indemnified Parties may not recover any Losses unless and
until the Indemnified Parties have paid, incurred, sustained or accrued in
accordance with GAAP Losses in excess of $200,000 in the aggregate (the "
_Threshold Amount_ "), in which case the Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to recover all indemnifiable Losses accrued in accordance with GAAP,
paid, incurred or sustained, including the Threshold Amount. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent shall be entitled to recover for, and the Threshold
Amount shall not apply as a threshold to, any and all claims or payments made
with respect to (A) all Losses incurred or sustained pursuant to clauses
(iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of _Section 7.2_ , or (B) pursuant to _Section
7.7_. For the purposes hereof, " _Officer s Certificate_" shall mean a
certificate signed by any officer of Parent and delivered to the Escrow Agent
and the Stockholder Representative: (1) stating that Parent has paid,
incurred, sustained or accrued in accordance with GAAP, or reasonably
anticipates that it will have to pay, incur, sustain or accrue in accordance
with GAAP Losses, (2) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items
of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid,
incurred, sustained or accrued in accordance with GAAP, or the basis for such
anticipated liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or covenant to which such item is related, and (3) the amount of
cash to be delivered to Parent in compensation for such Losses.



(c) _Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Period_. Subject
to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in
existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at
5:00 p.m., local time, on the Survival Date (the " _Escrow Period_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Escrow Fund with respect to the Sales
Tax Escrow Amount shall terminate as set forth on _Schedule 7.2_ , and (ii)
the Escrow Period shall not terminate with respect to any amount which, in the
reasonable judgment of Parent, subject to the good faith objection of the
Stockholder Representative, is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims
specified in any Officers Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to
the Survival Date with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to
the Survival Date. As soon as all such claims have been resolved (other than
claims for any Losses related to the matters set forth on  



 

-79-   _Schedule 7.2)_ the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Company Stockholders
the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund (other than the Sales Tax
Escrow Amount), if any, not required to satisfy such claims. Deliveries of
the Escrow Amount (including the Sales Tax Escrow Amount) out of the Escrow
Fund to the former Company Stockholders pursuant to this _Section 7.3(c)_
shall be made in proportion to their respective Allocable Portions;
_provided, however_ , that any cash contributed to the Escrow Fund by former
Company Stockholders who formerly held Dissenting Shares, (resulting in the
reallocation of the Pro Rata Escrow Portions as a result of Dissenting Shares
ceasing to be Dissenting Shares pursuant to the definition of " _Pro Rata
Escrow Portion_ ") and any amounts payable in respect of Dissenting Share
Shortfalls pursuant to _Section 1.7(d)_  hereof shall be distributed to the
former Company Stockholders who never held Dissenting Shares on the six month
anniversary of the Closing Date in proportion to the respective Pro Rata
Escrow Portions of such former Company Stockholders (relative to each other).



(d) _Protection of Escrow Fund_. The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard
the Escrow Fund during the Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust
fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and not as the property of
Parent and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with
the terms of this _Article VII_. Unless Parent and the Stockholder
Representative jointly submit to the Escrow Agent written instructions
directing otherwise, the funds shall be placed in a U.S. Bank interest bearing
money market account.



(e) _Claims for Indemnification_. 



(i) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent at any time on or before the Survival
Date, or, with respect to claims for any Losses related to the matters set
forth on _Schedule 7.2_ , prior to the release of the Sales Tax Escrow Amount
in accordance with _Schedule 7.2_ of an Officers Certificate, the Escrow
Agent shall, subject to the provisions of _Section 7.3(f)_ , deliver to
Parent, as promptly as practicable, an amount of cash from the Escrow Fund
equal to the amount of Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent an Officers Certificate alleges
only the basis for anticipated Losses, no amount shall be distributed until
such Losses are actually paid, incurred, sustained or accrued in accordance
with GAAP.



(ii) If the Stockholder Representative does not object in writing within the
30-day period set forth in _Section 7.3(f)_ after delivery by Parent of the
Officers Certificate to the Stockholder Representative, such failure to so
object shall constitute an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder
Representative on behalf of the former Company Stockholders that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set
forth in such Officers Certificate.



(f) _Objections to Claims against the Escrow Fund_. At the time of delivery
of any Officers Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such
certificate shall be delivered to the Stockholder Representative, and for a
period of thirty  



 

-80-  (30) days after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery to
Parent of any Escrow Amount pursuant to _Section 7.3(e)_ unless the
Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the Stockholder
Representative to make such delivery. After the expiration of such thirty
(30)-day period, the Escrow Agent shall make payment pursuant to _Section
7.3(e)(i)_ , _provided_  that no such payment may be made if the Stockholder
Representative shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the
Officers Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the
Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period.



(g) _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_.



(i) In case the Stockholder Representative shall object in writing to any
claim or claims made in any Officers Certificate to recover Losses from the
Escrow Fund within thirty (30) days after delivery of such Officers
Certificate, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good
faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each
of such claims. If the Stockholder Representative and Parent should so agree,
a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed
by both parties and, in the case of a claim against the Escrow Fund, shall be
furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on
any such memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with the terms thereof.



(ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and
prior to sixty (60) days after delivery of an Officers Certificate, either
Parent or the Stockholder Representative may demand arbitration of the matter
unless the amount of the Loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third
party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is
ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration, and in either such event the
matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by one arbitrator
mutually agreeable to Parent and the Stockholder Representative. In the event
that, within thirty (30) days after submission of any dispute to arbitration,
Parent and the Stockholder Representative cannot mutually agree on one
arbitrator, then, within fifteen (15) days after the end of such thirty
(30)-day period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall each select
one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select a third
arbitrator. If one party but not the other fails to select an arbitrator
during this fifteen (15)-day period, then the parties agree that the
arbitration will be conducted by the one arbitrator selected by the party
which has made such a selection.



(iii) Any such arbitration shall be held in Santa Clara County,
California, under the rules and procedures then in effect of the American
Arbitration Association. The arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses
relating to the arbitration shall be paid, including the respective expenses
of each party, the fees of each arbitrator and the administrative fee of the
American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case
may be, shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to
reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties an
opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of
the three  



 

-81-  arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover relevant information from the
opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or
a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon
motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose
sanctions, including attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as a
competent court of law or equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the
three arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that discovery was sought
without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to
without substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator or a
majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and
amount of any claim in such Officers Certificate shall be final, binding, and
conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement. Such decision shall be written
and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall
set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s),
and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and make distributions
from the Escrow Fund in accordance with, the terms of such award, judgment,
decree or order as applicable. Within thirty (30) days of a decision of the
arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another, such party shall make
the payment to such other party.



(iv) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction. The foregoing arbitration provision shall apply
to any dispute between the Stockholder Representative and the Indemnified
Party under this _Article VII_ other than  _Section 7.7_ , whether relating
to claims upon the Escrow Fund or to the other indemnification obligations set
forth in this _Article VII_.



(h) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third-party
claim which Parent reasonably believes may result in a demand against the
Escrow Fund or for other indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_ ,
Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative in writing of such claim,
and the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the former
Company Stockholders, at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine
or conduct, the defense of such claim. If there is a third party claim against
an Indemnified Party that, if adversely determined would give rise to a right
of recovery for Losses hereunder, then any Losses reasonably paid, incurred,
sustained or accrued in accordance with GAAP in defense of such third-party
claim, regardless of the outcome of such claim, shall be deemed Losses
hereunder. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the
defense of, and to settle, any such claim; _provided, however_ , that (i)
Parent shall first consult with the Stockholder Representative regarding such
settlement and (ii) except with the consent in writing of the Stockholder
Representative, no settlement of any such claim with third-party claimants
shall be determinative of whether Parent or any other party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_ or the amount of
such indemnification, if any. In the event that the Stockholder
Representative has consented in writing to any such settlement, the Company
Stockholders shall have no power or authority to object under any provision of
this _Article VII_ to the amount of any claim by Parent against the Escrow
Fund with respect to such settlement or amount.



 

-82- (i) _Escrow Agent s Duties_.



(i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such
duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any
additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive
after the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and
the Stockholder Representative, and may rely and shall be protected
in relying or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to
be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or
parties. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of
reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith.



(ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all
warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other person, excepting
only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to
comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court. In case the
Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any
court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to
any other person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order,
judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled,
set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction.



(iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the
identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or
purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers
deposited or called for hereunder.



(iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights
under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any
documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.



(v) In performing any duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not
be liable to any party for damages, losses or expenses, except for negligence
or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall
not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to act made or omitted
in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon
any instrument, including any written statement of affidavit provided for in
this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be
genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries,
fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any representative
authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel in
connection with performing the Escrow Agents duties under this Agreement and
shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her
in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel. The Escrow Agent is
not responsible for determining and verifying the authority of any person
acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party to this Agreement.



 

-83- (vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with
any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms
or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the
controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all
documents and the Escrow Amount and may wait for settlement of any such
controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the
Escrow Agents discretion, may be required, despite what may be set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be
liable for damages. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an
action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims
and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with
the clerk of the court all documents and the Escrow Amounts held in escrow,
except all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by
the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action and which the parties jointly
and severally agree to pay. Upon initiating such action, the Escrow Agent
shall be fully released and discharged of and from all obligations and
liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.



(vii) The parties and their respective successors and assigns agree jointly
and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, including reasonable costs
of investigation, counsel fees, including allocated costs of in-house counsel
and disbursements that may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow
Agent in connection with the performance of its duties under this Agreement,
including any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving its subject
matter, other than those arising out of the negligence or willful misconduct
of the Escrow Agent.



(viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty
(30) days written notice to Parent and the Stockholder Representative;
_provided, however_ , that no such resignation shall become effective until
the appointment of a successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as
follows: Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent
within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. If the parties fail
to agree upon a successor escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent
shall have the right to appoint a successor escrow agent authorized to do
business in the State of California. The successor escrow agent shall execute
and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and it shall, without
further acts, be vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and
duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally named as escrow agent.
Upon appointment of a successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall be
discharged from any further duties and liability under this Agreement.



(j) _Fees_. All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties
hereunder shall be paid by Parent in accordance with the standard fee
schedule of the  



 

-84-  Escrow Agent. It is understood that the fees and usual charges agreed upon
for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation for
ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the
conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow
Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if the
parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if any
controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes
in, any litigation pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject matter, the
Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services
and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys fees, including allocated costs of
in-house counsel, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy
or litigation.



(k) _Successor Escrow Agents_. Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent in
its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a
party, or any corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust
business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred,
shall be the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without further act.



7.4 _Stockholder Representative_.



(a) Upon the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby by the Company Stockholders,
effective at the Effective Time, and without further act of any Company
Stockholder, Mark Soane shall be appointed as the Stockholder Representative
and as the agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of each Company
Stockholder to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize
payment to Parent from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent, to
object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all other
actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii)
specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be
changed by the former Company Stockholders from time to time upon not less
than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent; _provided, however_ ,
that the Stockholder Representative may not be removed unless holders of a
two-thirds interest of the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the
identity of the substituted agent. A vacancy in the position of Stockholder
Representative may be filled by the holders of a majority in interest of the
Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative, and
the Stockholder Representative shall not receive any compensation for its
services. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative
shall constitute notice to or from the former Company Stockholders.



(b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith.
The  



 

-85-  former Company Stockholders on whose behalf the Escrow Amount was
contributed to the Escrow Fund shall indemnify the Stockholder Representative
and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless against any loss, liability
or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Stockholder Representatives duties
hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel
retained by the Stockholder Representative. At the time of distribution
pursuant to _Sections 1.9_ and _7.3(c)_ to the former Company Stockholders of
any proceeds remaining in the Escrow Fund, to the extent that any distribution
out of the Escrow Fund to the former Company Stockholders includes amounts
representing income and gains earned with respect to the Escrow Fund or that
would represent Earn-Out Payments, the Stockholder Representative shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from such income and gains included in such
distribution or that would represent Earn-Out Payment amounts to pay and
reimburse fees and expenses incurred or expected to be incurred in connection
with his role as Stockholder Representative pursuant to this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Stockholder Representative shall not be entitled
to deduct and withhold any such amounts in excess of $500,000 in the
aggregate.



(c) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.3_ and _Section 8.4_ , shall constitute a decision of
the former Company Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive
upon the former Company Stockholders; and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely
upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the
former Company Stockholders. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved
from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative.



7.5 _Maximum Payments; Remedy_. 



(a) Subject to _Section 7.5(b)_ , the maximum amount an Indemnified Party may
recover that would otherwise be distributable to a particular Company
Stockholder pursuant to the indemnity set forth in _Section 7.2_ for Losses
shall be limited to an amount equal to such Company Stockholders Pro Rata
Escrow Portion and the right of set-off pursuant to _Section 7.6(b)_.



(b) Nothing herein shall limit the liability of any party hereto for any
breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in
this Agreement if the Merger does not close.



7.6 _Exclusive Remedy; Right of Set-Off_.



(a) Except as provided in this _Section 7.6_ , from and after the Effective
Time resort to the Escrow Fund shall be the exclusive right and remedy of  



 

-86-  Parent and the Indemnified Parties for breaches of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company contained herein or any
other matter with respect to which Parent and the other Indemnified Parties
would otherwise be entitled to indemnification hereunder. Except for claims
for equitable relief and claims with respect to fraud solely against the
person or persons committing or alleged to have committed such fraud,
recovery from the Escrow Fund and the unpaid Earn-Out Payments pursuant to
_Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.5_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Indemnified Parties for any matter that is otherwise indemnifiable hereunder
if the Merger contemplated hereby is consummated.



(b) _Right of Set-Off_. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement
to the contrary, if the Escrow Fund shall be insufficient to satisfy any and
all Losses incurred by the Indemnified Parties with respect to which any of
them would otherwise be entitled to indemnification under this _Article VII_
(" _Excess Losses_ "), Parent shall be entitled to set-off any such Excess
Losses against any Earn-Out Payments otherwise remaining payable by Parent to
the former Company Stockholders under this Agreement. Any such payment shall
be withheld from the Earn-Out Payments otherwise payable with respect to each
former Company Stockholder in proportion to their respective Allocable
Portions. If an Excess Loss is anticipated but not yet incurred or accrued in
accordance with GAAP or paid at the time that an Earn-Out Payment is due to be
released, then Parent shall be entitled, following and subject to delivery of
a valid Officers Certificate to the Stockholder Representative with respect
to such anticipated Loss, to withhold an amount equal to such amount from the
Earn-Out Payments otherwise payable pursuant to the preceding sentence and, if
the Escrow Fund then remains in existence, deposit such amount with the
Escrow Agent to be held in escrow until a final determination is made
regarding such Excess Loss, and shall distribute the remainder of the Earn-Out
Payment, if any, in accordance with  _Section 1.9_. The ultimate distribution
of such withheld amount shall be made in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement governing the Escrow Fund which relate to disputes regarding an
Officers Certificate, except that no such notices shall be provided to the
Escrow Agent if the Escrow Fund shall have been terminated prior to the date
of such withholding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in no event shall the right of set-off described in this  _Section
7.6(b)_ be interpreted to have the effect of extending the Survival Date or
otherwise expanding the scope of the Losses that are otherwise indemnifiable
pursuant to _Section 7.2_.



7.7 _Adjustments to Consideration_.



(a) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause
to be prepared and delivered to the Stockholder Representative an unaudited
statement setting forth Parents determination of Working Capital as of the
Closing, setting forth separately each of the following components of Working
Capital: (i) Cash and Cash Equivalents as of the Closing (without giving
effect to any actions taken by Parent that may become effective as of the
Closing), (ii) Receivables as of the Closing (without giving effect to any
actions taken by Parent that may become effective as of the  



 

-87-  Closing), (iii) Inventory as of the Closing (without giving effect to any
actions taken by Parent that may become effective as of the Closing), and
(iv) Accounts Payable as of the Closing (without giving effect to any actions
taken by Parent that may become effective as of the Closing) (the " _Post-
Closing Working Capital Statement_ "). The Post-Closing Working Capital
Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, and
shall include all invoices received by the Company at or prior to the Closing
Date. If the Post-Closing Working Capital Statement deviates from the Closing
Date Working Capital Statement in any respect, it shall be accompanied by an
explanation for any such deviation, together with reasonably detailed
documentary evidence supporting the basis for any such deviation.



(b) In the event that, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 7.7_ it is finally determined that:



(i) such Working Capital Deficit is _greater_  than the Working Capital
Deficit (including a Working Capital Deficit of zero) reflected in the Closing
Date Working Capital Statement, such difference shall be referred to herein as
an " _Additional Working Capital Deficit_ "; and 



(ii) such Working Capital Deficit (including a Working Capital Deficit of
zero) x is _less_ than the Working Capital Deficit reflected in the Closing
Date Working Capital Statement, such difference shall be referred to herein as
a " _Working Capital Surplus_."



(c) In the event that, pursuant to the terms of this _Section 7.7_ it
is determined that there exists an Additional Working Capital Deficit, then
Parent shall be entitled to recover the amount of such Additional Working
Capital Deficit out of the Escrow Fund upon the delivery to the Escrow Agent
of an Officers Certificate in accordance with and subject to the terms of
_Section 7.3(b)_.



(d) In the event that, pursuant to the terms of this _Section 7.7_ it is
determined that there exists a Working Capital Surplus, then Parent shall
promptly (and in any event, no more than five (5) business days after the
Working Capital Confirmation Date) release an amount equal to the Working
Capital Surplus to the Payment Agent for distribution to the former Company
Stockholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Escrow Portions.



(e) The Stockholder Representative shall have thirty (30) days
following delivery of the Post-Closing Working Capital Statement during which
to notify Parent in writing (the " _Notice of Objection_ ") of any good faith
objections to the calculation of the Additional Working Capital Deficit or
Working Capital Surplus, as applicable, or the Post-Closing Working Capital
Statement, as it affects such calculation, setting forth a reasonably specific
and detailed description of its objections and the dollar amount of each
objection. Following delivery by Parent to the Stockholder Representative of
the Post-Closing Working Capital Statement, Parent shall give the  



 

-88-  Stockholder Representative reasonable access during Parents normal business
hours to those books and records of the Surviving Corporation in
the possession of Parent and any personnel which relate to the preparation of
the Post-Closing Working Capital Statement for purposes of resolving any
disputes concerning the Post-Closing Working Capital Statement and the
calculation of the Additional Working Capital Deficit or Working Capital
Surplus, as applicable.



(f) If the Stockholder Representative objects to the Post-Closing Working
Capital Statement or Parents calculation of the Additional Working Capital
Deficit or Working Capital Surplus as reflected therein, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall attempt to resolve any such objections
within thirty (30) days of the receipt by Parent of the Notice of Objection.



(g) If Parent and the Stockholder Representative are unable to resolve any
such dispute within the thirty (30) day period referred to in
_Section 7.7(f)_ , Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall submit the
dispute to the Independent Auditors. Each of the parties to this Agreement
shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates and representatives to,
provide full cooperation to the Independent Auditors. The Independent
Auditors shall (x) act in its capacity as an expert and not as an arbitrator,
(y) consider only those matters as to which there is a dispute between the
parties and (z) be instructed to reach its conclusions regarding any such
dispute within thirty (30) days after its appointment and provide a written
explanation of its decision. In the event that Parent and the Stockholder
Representative submit any dispute to the Independent Auditors, each such
party may submit a "position paper" to the Independent Auditors setting forth
the position of such party with respect to such dispute, to be considered by
such Independent Auditors as it deems fit. Fifty percent (50%) of any expenses
relating to the engagement of the Independent Auditors shall be paid by
Parent and fifty percent (50%) of such expenses shall be paid by the
Stockholder Representative.



(h) If the Stockholder Representative fails to deliver a timely Notice of
Objection in accordance with _Section 7.7(e)_ (i.e., within a thirty (30) day
period), the Post-Closing Working Capital Statement (together with Parents
calculation of the Additional Working Capital Deficit or Working Capital
Surplus, as applicable reflected therein), shall be deemed to have been
finally accepted by all of the parties to this Agreement. In the event that
the Stockholder Representative delivers a Notice of Objection in accordance
with the provisions above and Parent and the Stockholder Representative are
able to resolve such dispute by mutual agreement, the Additional Working
Capital Deficit or Working Capital Surplus, as applicable, agreed by such
parties, shall be deemed to have been finally accepted by all of the parties
to this Agreement. In the event that the Stockholder Representative delivers
a Notice of Objection in accordance with the provisions set forth above and
Parent and the Stockholder Representative are unable to resolve such dispute
by mutual agreement, the determination of the Independent Auditors
with respect to the Additional Working Capital Deficit or Working Capital
Surplus, as applicable, shall be deemed to have been finally accepted by all
of the parties to this Agreement. The date upon which the  



 

-89-  calculation of the Additional Working Capital Deficit or Working Capital
Surplus reflected thereon is deemed to have been accepted by all parties shall
be referred to as the " _Working Capital Confirmation Date_." Following the
Working Capital Confirmation Date no further adjustments shall be made thereto
and neither Parent nor the Stockholder Representative shall have any further
right to challenge such calculation of the Working Capital Surplus or
Additional Working Capital Deficit, as applicable.
