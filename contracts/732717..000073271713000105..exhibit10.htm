2.3 Assumed and Excluded Liabilities. (a) The applicable Transferred Company
shall assume and be responsible, from and after the Closing, for (i) all of
the Liabilities of Seller and its Subsidiaries to the extent relating to,

Closing, other than the Excluded Liabilities and except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, (ii) all Liabilities in respect of the Assigned
Contracts and (iii) all Liabilities set forth on Annex 2.3(a) ((i), (ii) and
(iii) collectively, the "Assumed Liabilities") and (b) one or more members of
Seller Group, as applicable, shall assume and be responsible for (i) all of
the Liabilities of the Transferred Companies to the extent relating to,
arising out of or resulting from an Excluded Asset, whether incurred before,
on or after the Closing, (ii) any Liability of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries to their employees in their capacity as employers under any
employee benefits or similar plans, except to the extent expressly assumed by

or the Ancillary Documents, any liability for any fees or expenses incurred by

this Agreement, (v) any Liabilities of the Transferred Companies relating to,
arising out of or resulting from any business currently or formerly conducted

set forth on Annex 2.3(b), whether incurred before, on or after the Closing,
except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement (collectively, the

and expressly exclude any obligation of any member of the Seller Group to
assume or be responsible for any Liability related to the infringement,
misappropriation or other violation of any Intellectual Property rights.

  

  

2.4 Nonassignability of Assets.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement to
the extent that the conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery or attempted
conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery to or from the Transferred
Companies, as the case may be, of any asset that would be a Transferred Asset
or Excluded Asset, as applicable, or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom (and the subsequent acquisition of the
Transferred Companies by Buyer) is prohibited by any applicable Law or would
result in a violation or breach of Contract, or would require any Governmental
Authorizations or third-party authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers,
and such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers have not been
obtained, or such violation or breach has not been cured, prior to the Closing
(the "Unassigned Assets"), the Closing shall proceed without the conveyance,
transfer, assignment or delivery of such asset and there shall be no
adjustment to the Purchase Price. The parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts, and cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly such
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers or cure any such violation or
breach; provided, however, that none of Seller or its Subsidiaries or Buyer or
its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any consideration therefor, other
than filing, recordation or similar fees. Seller shall not authorize or enter
into any agreement or commitment with respect to obtaining any such
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers or curing any such violation or
breach that would be binding on the Transferred Business without Buyer's prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned unless the agreement or commitment would require Buyer to pay
increased fees or expenses (or receive decreased revenues) with respect
thereto). Pending such authorization, approval, consent or waiver, or the cure
of any such violation or breach and subject to Section 6.13, in the case of
Customer Contracts that are Unassigned Assets, the parties shall cooperate
with each other in any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful arrangements
designed to provide (a) to the intended transferee the benefits of use of such
Unassigned Asset and (b) to the intended transferor (i) the benefits that they
would have obtained had the Unassigned Asset been conveyed at the Closing and
(ii) relief from all Liabilities associated with such Unassigned Asset. Once
authorization, approval, consent or waiver for the conveyance, transfer,
assignment, or delivery of any such Unassigned Asset not conveyed,
transferred, assigned, or delivered at the Closing is obtained, or such
violation or breach is cured, Seller or Buyer, as applicable, shall, or shall
cause the applicable Subsidiary or Subsidiaries to, convey, transfer and
deliver such Unassigned Asset to the intended transferee for no additional
cost (other than any applicable Transfer Taxes for which Buyer shall be
responsible in accordance with Section 6.5(e) hereof), and such Unassigned
Asset shall thereafter be deemed to be a Transferred Asset or Excluded Asset,
as applicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 18  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) To the extent that any such Unassigned Asset cannot be transferred or the
full benefits of use of any such Unassigned Asset cannot be provided to the
intended transferee following the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.4, then
Buyer and Seller or the applicable Subsidiary shall enter into such
arrangements (including subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide
to the parties hereto the operational equivalent, to the extent permitted, of
obtaining such authorization, approval, consent or waiver, and the performance
by the intended transferee of the obligations thereunder. Seller or Buyer, as
applicable, shall hold in trust for and pay to the other party promptly upon
receipt thereof, all income, proceeds and other monies received by such party
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with its use of any Unassigned Asset
in connection with the arrangements under this Section 2.4. Buyer or Seller,
as applicable, shall pay to the other party, promptly upon receipt of any
invoice from the other party, all losses generated by such party or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the intended transferee's use of any
Unassigned Asset in connection with the arrangements under this Section 2.4.
Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.4(b) with respect to any such
Unassigned Asset shall continue for the duration of the term of such
Unassigned Asset. This Section 2.4(b) shall not apply to Customer Contracts
addressed in Section 6.13.

  

  

2.5 Transfer Documentation. The transfers of Transferred Assets and Excluded
Assets, and the assumption of Assumed Liabilities and Excluded Liabilities,
shall be effected pursuant to the Transfer Documents substantially in the
forms attached as Annex 2.5(a) to this Agreement; provided, however, that the
transfer of the Transferred Trademarks shall be effected pursuant to the
Intellectual Property Agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit
H to this Agreement. Any substantive amendments, supplements or deviations
from such forms shall require the prior written consent of Buyer.

3.6 Working Capital Adjustment.

  

  

(a) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer an estimated pro forma (for the Pre-Closing
Reorganization) statement of Net Working Capital of the Transferred Business
as of 12:01 a.m. Connecticut time, on the Closing Date, which statement will
be prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied in a manner consistent with the
preparation of the Historical Financial Information and in accordance with the
principles, policies and methodologies set forth in Exhibit D attached hereto
(collectively, the "Working Capital Principles"). If there is a conflict in
the principles, policies or methodologies between GAAP, applied in a manner
consistent with the Historical Financial Information, and Exhibit D, then
Exhibit D shall prevail. The process described in this Section 3.6 is not
intended to permit the introduction of different accounting methodologies,
classification, practices, estimation techniques, assumptions and principles
to the preparation of the Estimated Working Capital Statement or the Final
Working Capital Statement from those used in the pro forma balance sheet as of
September 30, 2013 included in the Transferred Business Information, except as
may be expressly provided for in the definitions set forth herein and in
Exhibit D attached hereto. The statement prepared in accordance with the
foregoing is referred to as the "Estimated Working Capital Statement". Seller
shall also prepare and deliver to Buyer a worksheet showing the difference, if
any, between the Net Working Capital shown on the Estimated Working Capital
Statement (the "Estimated Net Working Capital") and the Net Working Capital
Threshold. The amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital
exceeds the Net Working Capital Threshold is referred to herein as the
"Estimated Buyer Working Capital Payment." The amount, if any, by which the
Net Working Capital Threshold exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital is
referred to herein as the "Estimated Seller Working Capital Payment."

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 21  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, no later than sixty (60)
days after the Closing Date, a statement of Net Working Capital of the
Transferred Business as of 12:01 a.m. Connecticut time, on the Closing Date,
which statement (the "Final Working Capital Statement") will be prepared in
accordance with the Working Capital Principles, together with a worksheet
showing the difference, if any, between the Net Working Capital shown on the
Final Working Capital Statement (the "Final Net Working Capital") and the
Estimated Net Working Capital. For the avoidance of doubt, no changes shall be
made in any reserve or other account prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied
in a manner consistent with the Working Capital Principles, existing as of the
Closing Date; provided, however, that it being understood that the foregoing
will in no way prevent Buyer from objecting to any error or mistake in
estimation or the calculation of any reserve or other account in accordance
with GAAP, applied in a manner consistent with the Working Capital Principles.
From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide Seller and its authorized
representatives with reasonable access to the Transferred Business, including
the Transferred Books and Records, and other information that relates to the
Final Working Capital Statement as Seller shall from time to time reasonably
request.

  

  

(c) For thirty (30) days following its receipt of the Final Working Capital
Statement, Buyer shall have the right to object thereto or any portion
thereof. Any such objection made by Buyer shall be accompanied by materials
showing in reasonable detail Buyer's support for its position or a reasonable
basis for why it lacks sufficient information on which to make such an
objection. Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any rights to object to the
Final Working Capital Statement unless Buyer furnishes its written objections,
together with supporting materials, to Seller within such thirty (30) day
period. Within thirty (30) days after Seller's receipt of Buyer's objection to
the Final Working Capital Statement, Buyer and Seller shall meet to resolve
any differences in their respective positions with respect to the Final
Working Capital Statement. Each party shall provide the other party supporting
documentation and make their respective representatives reasonably available
to answer questions as to their respective positions with respect to the Final
Working Capital Statement. If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on the
Final Working Capital Statement within ninety (90) days after Seller's receipt
of Buyer's written objections, then an independent accounting firm of
recognized national standing in the United States as may be mutually selected
by Buyer and Seller shall resolve any remaining disagreements. If such
mutually selected accounting firm is not willing and able to serve in such
capacity, then Seller shall deliver to Buyer a list of three (3) other
accounting firms of recognized national standing and Seller shall select one
(1) of such three (3) accounting firms (such firm as is ultimately selected
pursuant to the aforementioned procedures being the "Accountant"). Buyer and
Seller shall execute any agreement reasonably required by the Accountant for
its engagement hereunder. The Accountant, acting as an expert and not as an
arbitrator, shall be charged with determining as promptly as practicable, but
in any event within thirty (30) days after the date on which such dispute is
referred to the Accountant, whether Final Net Working Capital and the Final
Working Capital Statement were prepared in accordance with this Agreement,
including the Working Capital Principles, and (only with respect to the
disagreements as to the items set forth in the notice of disagreement and
submitted to the Accountant and any other items affected by the resolution of
those disputed items, and in all instances, the Accountant's determinations
must be within the range of the amounts asserted by Buyer and Seller) whether
and to what extent, if any, Final Net Working Capital and the Final Working
Capital Statement require adjustment. The Accountant shall allocate its costs
and expenses between Buyer and Seller based upon the percentage of the
contested amount submitted to the Accountant that is ultimately awarded to
Buyer on the one hand or Seller on the other hand, such that Buyer bears a
percentage of such costs and expenses equal to the percentage of the contested
amount awarded to Seller and Seller bears a percentage of such costs and
expenses equal to the percentage of the contested amount awarded to Buyer. If
there is no timely objection as provided above, the Final Working Capital
Statement as determined by Seller shall be binding and final for purposes of
this Agreement. If there is a timely objection as provided above, the
determination of the Accountant shall be binding and final for purposes of
this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 22  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) The difference between the Final Net Working Capital and the Estimated Net
Working Capital shall be referred to as the "Working Capital Difference."
Within two (2) Business Days following the final determination of the Final
Working Capital Statement, whether by agreement between Buyer and Seller or as
set forth in Section 3.6(b), Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount, together
with interest thereon calculated pursuant to the last sentence of this
paragraph (d), equal to the Working Capital Difference, if the Working Capital
Difference is a positive number, and Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount,
together with interest thereon calculated pursuant to the last sentence of
this paragraph (d), equal to the absolute value of the Working Capital
Difference, if the Working Capital Difference is a negative number. Such
amounts shall be paid, in immediately available funds, pursuant to the
instructions previously delivered by Buyer or Seller, as applicable. Any
payment under this Section 3.6(d) shall accrue interest from time to time at
the rate of 200 basis points per annum above the "prime rate" as announced
from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. (or any successor thereto) from the
Closing Date to the date of payment. Any payment made pursuant to this Section
3.6(d) shall, for tax purposes, be deemed to be an adjustment to the
consideration payable to Seller.

  

  

3.7 Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable
hereunder, or other payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, the
amounts required to be deducted and withheld under the Code, or any provision
of any U.S. federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. Any amounts so withheld
shall be paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Except as set forth in the applicable section or subsection of the disclosure
schedules delivered to Buyer by Seller prior to the execution hereof (the

its Subsidiaries, as applicable, of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, except for those consents, approvals, waivers, authorizations,

which the Transferred Business is subject, or under any Governmental
Authorizations, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, modifications,
accelerations, losses or Encumbrances that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect
(disregarding clauses (vi)-(viii) of the first proviso in the definition of
Seller Material Adverse Effect) or prevent or materially impair or delay
Seller's or its Subsidiaries' ability to perform their respective obligations
under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents.

4.10 Employees and Employee Benefits.

  

  

(a) As used in this Agreement, "Seller Benefit Plans" means all (i) "employee
benefit plans" as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") and (ii) all other incentive,
profit-sharing, stock option, stock purchase, other equity-based compensation,
employment, compensation, vacation or other leave, change in control,
retention, supplemental retirement, severance, health, medical, disability,
life insurance, welfare, deferred compensation, fringe benefit and other
employee compensation and benefit plans, programs, practices and agreements,
written or oral, in each case established or maintained by Seller or any of
its Affiliates and (x) that will (or will be required to) be established or
maintained by Buyer on the Closing Date as provided herein, (y) with respect
to which any Business Employee is (or will be) entitled to any benefit, or (z)
with respect to which any Transferred Company has any liability. As used in
this Agreement, the "Business Employees" means (i) all active Listed Employees
who are employees of the Transferred Companies immediately prior to the
Closing and (ii) all Listed Employees who are employees of the Transferred
Companies as of immediately prior to the Closing and are on maternity or
paternity leave, educational leave, short-term disability, military leave with
veterans' reemployment rights under federal law, leave under the Family
Medical Leave Act of 1993, or any other approved leave of absence, but
excluding all Retained Employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Listed
Employee who is on short-term disability or a disability leave of absence
immediately prior to the Closing shall not become a Business Employee unless
and until the administrator of the short-term disability Seller Benefit Plan
applicable to the Listed Employee determines that such Listed Employee is
cleared to return and such Listed Employee actually returns (during the Listed
Employee's applicable short-term disability period) to active work (whether
full-time, part-time, or with accommodations required pursuant to the
Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 or any amendments thereto) for a
period of time that is sufficient (under the terms of the short-term
disability Seller Benefit Plan applicable to the Listed Employee) to treat the
participant as no longer having the disability. The Seller Benefit Plans
sponsored or maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates other than the
Transferred Companies are set forth on Seller Schedule 4.10(a)(i), and those
Seller Benefit Plans that are currently sponsored or maintained by a
Transferred Company (the "Company Plans") are set forth on Seller Schedule
4.10(a)(ii). None of the Company Plans will be sponsored or maintained by a
Transferred Company as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. With respect
to each Seller Benefit Plan, Seller has made available to Buyer true and
complete copies of all plan documents, summary plan descriptions, and any
other documentation that is material to Buyer's obligations under Section 6.6.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 30  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Each Seller Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in compliance
with its terms and with applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code, except
for any non-compliance that, individually and in the aggregate, would not be
material to the Transferred Companies, taken as a whole. None of Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Seller
Benefit Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as
of the date of this Agreement (in the case of a Tax or penalty imposed by
Section 4975 of the Code), would reasonably be expected to subject the
Transferred Companies or any Seller Benefit Plan to a Tax or penalty imposed
by Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which could be material or by Section
4975 of the Code. Each Seller Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code, and the trust (if any) forming a part thereof, has
received a favorable determination letter from the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS"), each trust maintained under any Seller Benefit Plan intended
to satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code has received
recognition of exemption from the IRS, and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no
event has occurred and no condition exists that would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect such qualified or exempt status.

  

  

(c) No liability under Section 412 of the Code, Section 302 of ERISA or Title
IV of ERISA has been or is reasonably expected to be incurred by the
Transferred Companies or any ERISA Affiliate. As used in this Agreement,
"ERISA Affiliate" means, with respect to a Transferred Company, any Person or
any trade or business, whether or not incorporated, that, together with such
Transferred Company, would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of
Section 4001(b) of ERISA.

  

  

(d) No Seller Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA. None of the Transferred Companies or any ERISA Affiliate has
made or suffered or will as of the Closing Date (including as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) have made or
suffered a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" as such terms are
respectively defined in Section 4203 and 4205 of ERISA, the liability for
which has not been satisfied in full.

  

  

(e) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any material
Seller Benefit Plan have been timely made when due and are appropriately
reflected on the ILEC Financial Statements.

  

  

(f) None of the Transferred Companies has any obligations for retiree welfare
benefits other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable Law or (ii)
Transferred Company contributions toward such mandated coverage that continues
during a severance period that does not exceed 18 months.

  

  

(g) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened claims
against Seller or its Affiliates under workers' compensation law or under the
Seller Benefit Plans that (i) could transfer to Buyer (in whole or in part) in
connection with an assumption of obligations required by Section 6.6, (ii) are
not accrued under the applicable Seller Benefit Plan or reflected on the ILEC
Financial Statements and (iii) if adversely determined, would, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Liability to Buyer of
more than $1 million.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 31  

  

 

 

 

  

(h) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents will not (either alone or together with any other
event) (i) entitle any Business Employee to severance, change of control or
other similar pay or benefits under any Seller Benefit Plan, or (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits to any
Business Employee or beneficiary of any Business Employee under, or increase
the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation with respect to
any Business Employee or beneficiary of any Business Employee, or (iii) limit
or restrict the right of Buyer or any Transferred Company to merge, amend, or
terminate (as to any Business Employee or beneficiary of any Business
Employee) any Seller Benefit Plan.

  

  

(i) Seller Schedule 4.10(i) sets forth a list that is complete in all material
respects (as of the date set forth therein) of all employees of the Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries who have devoted a majority of their working time to
the ILEC Services during the 60 days preceding the date set forth therein,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, employees who have been hired or
transferred into the Transferred Companies in the Ordinary Course during such
period (the employees on such schedule, as shall be updated prior to the
Closing Date to reflect terminations, transfers, promotions and new hires in
the Ordinary Course, the "Listed Employees"), separately identifying each
Retained Employee and identifying as to each Listed Employee, such Listed
Employee's identification number and job title.

  

  

(j) As of the date hereof, the Transferred Companies are not obligated under
any service provider Contract for payroll, human resources, or employee
benefits.

  

  

4.11 Labor and Employment Matters.

  

  

(a) Except for the collective bargaining agreements with the CWA disclosed in
Seller Schedule 4.11(a) (each a "Collective Bargaining Agreement" and,
collectively, the "Collective Bargaining Agreements"), neither Seller nor any
of its Subsidiaries is party to or bound by any collective bargaining
agreement or other agreement with a labor union regarding any of the Business
Employees. Neither Seller nor any of its subsidiaries is currently engaged in
negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement covering any of the Business
Employees or is under an obligation to do so as a result of a unit
certification issued by the National Labor Relations Board.

  

  

(b) Seller and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects
with all Laws and material contractual obligations respecting employment,
employment practices and terms and conditions of employment applicable to the
Business Employees, including those relating to wages, hours, equal
opportunity, labor relations, workplace safety and the payment of social
security and unemployment taxes (as well as any other taxes to which Section
6.6(k) applies).

  

  

(c) Neither Seller nor its Subsidiaries have engaged in any reductions in
force or plant closings affecting Business Employees which trigger any notice
obligation under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act as of
the one-year period preceding the date hereof that remain unsatisfied and do
not anticipate engaging in any such activity prior to Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 32  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) There is no pending, or to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened strike,
lockout, walkout, other work stoppage, or any adverse labor action such as
picketing or boycott by any labor organization, or any union organizing effort
by or among any of the Business Employees, except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Liability to Buyer
of more than $1 million.

  

  

(e) There is no unfair labor practice charge or complaint against any of the
Transferred Companies or related to the Business Employees pending or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, threatened in writing before the National Labor Relations
Board or any other Governmental Entity. There is no unit clarification or
representation petition pending before the National Labor Relations Board.

  

  

(f) There is no grievance or labor arbitration against any of the Transferred
Companies pending, or to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened in writing,
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to result in a Liability to Buyer of more than $1 million.

Business is being, and has been for the three (3) year period prior to the
date of this Agreement, conducted in compliance in all material respects with
applicable Laws; (b) during the three (3) year period prior to the date of
this Agreement, none of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice alleging (1) that the Transferred Business has been conducted
in violation of applicable Law in any material respect or (2) that the
Transferred Business is under investigation with respect to any such material
violation; and (c) the Transferred Companies have all the Governmental
Authorizations issued by the FCC, the State Commissions or other Governmental
Entity under all Laws currently in effect that are material to the conduct of
the Transferred Business as currently conducted (collectively, the "Seller

intended to address Taxes or Environmental Laws or the matters addressed by
Section 4.18 (Communications Licenses). As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no applications by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries pending before
the FCC, the State Commissions or any other Governmental Entity for additional
authorizations that would be Seller Authorizations if they existed as of the
date of this Agreement.

Transferred Leased Real Property are in compliance with all Environmental

Environmental Laws, compliance with the terms and conditions thereof, and
compliance with all reporting, discharge and emission requirements under or
pursuant to all Environmental Laws and neither Seller nor any of the
Transferred Companies has received any written communication (or, if oral,
reasonably likely to result in a written allegation or notice of violation),
whether from a Governmental Entity or any other Person, that alleges that any
of the Transferred Companies are not in such compliance with all Environmental
Laws except in each case as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 33

threatened, against the Transferred Business or, to the Knowledge of Seller,

Page 36  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Seller has made available to Buyer complete and accurate copies of each
Material Contract as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Each Material
Contract is valid and binding on Seller or its Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, and, to the Knowledge of Seller and solely with respect to Material
Contracts in effect as of the date of this Agreement, each other party
thereto, and is in full force and effect, except for failures to be valid and
binding or to be in full force and effect as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or materially impair or delay Seller's or its Subsidiaries' ability to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents. There is no default under any such Material Contract by Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the Knowledge of Seller and solely with
respect to Material Contracts in effect as of the date of this Agreement, any
other party thereto, and no event has occurred that, with the lapse of time or
the giving of notice or both, would constitute a default thereunder by Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the Knowledge of Seller and solely with
respect to Material Contracts in effect as of the date of this Agreement, any
other party thereto, in each case except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or materially impair or delay Seller's or its Subsidiaries' ability to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents.

  

  

4.16 Absence of Changes. Since December 31, 2012 and through the date of this
Agreement, (a) Seller and its Subsidiaries have conducted the Transferred
Business only in the Ordinary Course, and have not taken any actions which, if
taken after the date hereof, would require Buyer's consent pursuant to
Sections 6.2(a)(A) (with respect to actions taken after September 30, 2013,
and in all cases disregarding the proviso in Section 6.2(a)(A)), (E), (F) or
(J) and (b) the Transferred Business has not experienced any event or
condition, and no condition, change, event, occurrence or development has
occurred, that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would reasonably
be expected to have, a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

4.17 Assets. All material assets and properties of the Transferred Business
(excluding any Intellectual Property, IT Systems and Personal Information
included therein, which are the subject of the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 4.14), are in good operating condition and repair, normal
wear and tear excepted, and are useable in the Ordinary Course. Subject to the
immediately following sentence, the Transferred Assets, taken together with
the other assets, properties and rights of the Transferred Companies and the
licenses and services to be provided under the Ancillary Documents, constitute
all material assets, properties and rights of Seller and its Subsidiaries used
by Seller and its Subsidiaries to provide the ILEC Services (and to conduct
the business related thereto), as provided as of the date of the Agreement or
immediately prior to the Closing, and constitute all assets of Seller and its
Subsidiaries that are necessary or material to the conduct and operation
immediately after the Closing of the business conducted by the Transferred
Business substantially in the same manner as conducted by Seller and its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that: (i) the
Transferred Companies may not have those assets, properties, rights or
services listed or described on Seller Schedule 4.17, which may be used as of
the date of this Agreement or immediately prior to the Closing by Seller and
its Subsidiaries to provide the ILEC Services, (ii) the Excluded Assets may be
used as of the date of this Agreement or immediately prior to the Closing by
the Seller and its Subsidiaries to provide the ILEC Services, (iii) certain
licenses and services to be provided under the Ancillary Documents, which
licenses and services may be used as of the date of this Agreement or
immediately prior to the Closing by the Transferred Companies to provide the
ILEC Services, are being provided for only a limited period of time following
the Closing, (iv) the immediately preceding sentence assumes the receipt of
all necessary authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers required by Law,
Governmental Entities or other third Persons in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and
(v) this Section 4.17 does not constitute a representation or warranty
regarding infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any
Intellectual Property of any Person by the conduct of the Transferred
Business, which is the subject of the representation and warranty set forth in
Section 4.14(c). The ILEC Services constitute all of the material services
provided by the Transferred Companies to customers on the date of this
Agreement and immediately prior to the Closing.

legal holders or otherwise have rights to the Communications Licenses, which
licenses constitute all of the material licenses, from the FCC or the State
Commissions that are required for and/or used in the operation of the
Transferred Business as presently operated. All the Communications Licenses
are valid and in full force and effect, unimpaired by any condition, except
those conditions that may be contained within the terms of such Communications
Licenses or those conditions applicable to the particular class of
Communications Licenses generally. Seller and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended, and the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC and all applicable
State Commissions in respect of the operation of the Transferred Business.
There is not pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened, any action by
or before the FCC or any State Commissions in which the requested remedy is
the revocation, suspension, cancellation, rescission or modification of any of
the Communications Licenses. Seller Schedule 4.18 contains a complete and
correct list of Seller's Communications Licenses.

  

  

4.19 Title to Property. Seller and its applicable Subsidiaries have
transferred, and at or prior to the Closing will transfer, to the Transferred
Companies, as applicable, good and valid title to, or a valid and binding
leasehold interest in, the real and personal tangible property included in or
with the tangible Transferred Assets that they own or lease having a value in
excess of $25,000, or which are otherwise material to the Transferred
Business, free and clear of all Encumbrances, except (a) Encumbrances
specifically reflected or specifically reserved against in the Historical
Financial Information, (b) mechanics', materialmen's, warehousemen's,
carriers', workers', repairmen's or other similar common law or statutory
Encumbrances arising or incurred in the Ordinary Course and which would not
materially impair the use, operation or value of any material assets included

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, the Transferred Real Property and the
Transferred Leased Real Property have not suffered any material damage by fire
or other casualty which has not heretofore been repaired and restored to its
condition prior to such damage in all material respects, except for damage
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Seller Material Adverse Effect or reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impair or delay Seller's or its Subsidiaries' ability to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents.

  

  

4.21 Finders' Fees. Except for Greenhill and Co., LLC, whose fees will be paid
by Seller, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary
that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries that might be entitled to any fee or commission from
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

  

  

Except as set forth in the applicable section or subsection of the disclosure
schedules delivered to Seller by Buyer prior to the execution hereof (the
"Buyer Schedules" and, together with the Seller Schedules, the "Disclosure
Schedules") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or
subsection of the Buyer Schedules shall be deemed disclosure with respect to
any other section or subsection to which the relevance of such item is
reasonably apparent on its face), Buyer represents and warrants to Seller
that:

  

  

5.1 Organization and Qualification. Each of Buyer and each of its Subsidiaries
is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power
and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and to carry on its
business as currently conducted and is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign corporation or other entity in each jurisdiction
where the ownership or operation of its assets or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except for failures to be so qualified or in good
standing that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially impair or delay Buyer's or its Subsidiaries'
ability to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents.

  

  

5.2 Corporate Authorization. Buyer has full corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Documents, to
perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder. The execution, delivery
and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and each of the Ancillary
Documents, and the consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated
hereunder and thereunder, has been duly and validly authorized and no
additional corporate or shareholder authorization or consent is required in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Documents and the consummation by Buyer of
the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder.

  

  

5.3 Consents and Approvals.

  

  

(a) Other than (i) under the HSR Act, (ii) from or to the FCC, (iii) from or
to the State Commissions and (iv) the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory
Authority for a video franchise, no consent, approval, waiver, authorization,
report, notice or filing is required to be obtained by Buyer from, or to be
given by Buyer to, or made by Buyer with, any Governmental Entity in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, and the consummation by Buyer of the
transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder, except for those consents,
approvals, waivers, authorizations, reports, notices or filings the failure to
obtain, give or make, as the case may be, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay
Buyer's or its Subsidiaries' ability to perform their respective obligations
under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 40  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Assuming the receipt of all consents, approvals, waivers and
authorizations and the making of all notices and filings listed in Section
5.3(a), Buyer will be, as of the Closing Date, authorized under the
Communications Act and pursuant to such other Governmental Authorizations as
are required from all Governmental Entities to provide the ILEC Services and
to own and operate the Transferred Assets. As of the date of this Agreement,
there is no claim, lawsuit, agency complaint, investigation or proceeding
("Complaint") pending against Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the
Knowledge of Buyer, any threat to file a Complaint, in each case that if
determined adversely to Buyer would materially impair or delay Buyer's
qualifications to acquire the Transferred Companies, operate the Transferred
Business, obtain any Governmental Authorization that is required, or
materially delay the grant of any consent set forth on Buyer Schedule 5.3. As
of the date of this Agreement, no Complaint has been filed with any
Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
that raises any such question or results in any such delay.

  

  

5.4 Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of
this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Documents, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, do not and will not (i)
violate any provision of Buyer's organizational documents, (ii) assuming the
receipt of all consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations and the making
of the notices and filings listed in Section 5.3 or set forth on Buyer
Schedule 5.3, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of, or
constitute a default under, or result in the termination, cancellation,
modification or acceleration (whether after the filing of notice or the lapse
of time or both) of any right or obligation of Buyer under, or result in a
loss of any benefit to which Buyer is entitled under, any Contract or result
in the creation of any Encumbrance upon any of Buyer's or its Subsidiaries'
assets or (iii) assuming the receipt of all consents, approvals, waivers and
authorizations and the making of notices and filings listed in Section 5.3 or
set forth on Buyer Schedule 5.3 or required to be made or obtained by Seller
conflict with or result in a violation or breach of, or constitute a default
under, any Law to which Buyer is subject, or under any Governmental
Authorizations, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, modifications,
accelerations, losses or Encumbrances that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay
Buyer's or its Subsidiaries' ability to perform their respective obligations
under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents.

  

  

5.5 Binding Effect. This Agreement and each of the Ancillary Documents,
assuming due execution and delivery by Seller and the other parties thereto,
constitutes, or in the case of the Ancillary Documents will upon execution
thereof constitute, a valid and legally binding obligation of Buyer and each
of its Subsidiaries that is a party to such agreements, enforceable against
Buyer and each such Subsidiary in accordance with their respective terms,
subject, in each case, to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.

  

  

5.6 Litigation and Claims. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
civil, criminal or administrative action, suit, demand, claim, investigation,
review hearing or proceeding pending, or to the Knowledge of Buyer, threatened
against Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries at law or in equity relating to the
businesses of Buyer or its Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, other than those that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impair or delay Buyer's or its Subsidiaries' ability to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents.
As of the date of this Agreement, none of Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree of any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator or
arbitrators, other than those that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay
Buyer's or its Subsidiaries' ability to perform their respective obligations
under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents.

5.7 Finders' Fees. Except for J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Lazard Freres and
Co. LLC, whose fees will be paid by Buyer, there is no investment banker,
broker, finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is
authorized to act on behalf of Buyer, or any Subsidiary of Buyer, that might
be entitled to any fee or commission from Buyer or such Subsidiary of Buyer in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents.

  

  

5.8 Financial Capability. At the Closing, assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2, Buyer will have sufficient funds to
effect the Closing and all other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Documents and to conduct its businesses and operations
following the Closing. Buyer has provided to Seller, on or prior to the date
of this Agreement, a true, complete and correct copy of the executed financing
commitment letter among Buyer, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC, including any exhibits, annexes, schedules or amendments
thereto (collectively, the "Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which the lender
party thereto has committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions
set forth therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein (the "Debt
Financing"). As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Commitment Letter is
(A) a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer and, to the Knowledge of
Buyer, each of the other parties thereto, (B) enforceable in accordance with
its terms against Buyer and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, each of the other
parties thereto, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and
general equity principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity) and (C) in full force and effect, (ii) the
Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified, except as permitted
pursuant to Section 6.15, (iii) none of the obligations and commitments
contained in the Commitment Letter has been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded
in any respect, (iv) no event has occurred which (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) would constitute a default or breach on the part of
Buyer or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, any other parties thereto under the
Commitment Letter, and (v) Buyer does not have any reason to believe that any
of the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that the Debt
Financing will not be available to Buyer at the Closing Date. Buyer has fully
paid or caused to be paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in
connection with the Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the date
of this Agreement. The Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of the lenders thereunder to fund the Debt
Financing. Except for a fee letter relating to fees with respect to the Debt
Financing (a complete copy of which has been provided to Seller, with only the
fee amounts and certain economic terms of the market flex (none of which would
adversely affect the amount or availability of the Debt Financing) redacted),
as of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other
agreements, arrangements or contracts (including fee letters) to which Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party that would affect the availability of
the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter.
Without limiting Section 7.2, in no event shall the receipt or availability of
any funds or financing by or to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any other
financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Buyer
hereunder.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 42  

  

 

 

 

  

5.9 Solvency. As of the Closing, after giving effect to any indebtedness being
incurred on such date in connection herewith, and assuming satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2(c), and assuming that the Transferred
Business is not Insolvent (as defined below) as of the date of this Agreement
or as of the Closing, neither Buyer nor the Transferred Companies will (i) be
insolvent (either because its financial condition is such that the sum of its
debts (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent
liabilities) is greater than the fair value of its assets, or because the
present fair salable value of its assets will be less than the amount required
to pay its probable liability on its debts as they become absolute and
matured), (ii) have unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its
business or (iii) have incurred or plan to incur debts beyond its ability to
pay as they become absolute and matured (clauses (i)-(iii), "Insolvent").

  

  

5.10 Inspections

  

  

(a) . Buyer is an informed and sophisticated purchaser that is, and has
engaged expert advisers that are, experienced in the evaluation and purchase
of property and assets such as the Transferred Companies and the Transferred
Assets as contemplated hereunder. Buyer has undertaken such independent
investigation and has been provided with and has evaluated such documents and
information as it has deemed necessary to make an informed and intelligent
decision with respect to the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

  

  

ARTICLE VI

  

  

COVENANTS

  

  

6.1 Access and Information.

  

  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, subject to any
applicable Laws, Seller shall afford Buyer and its representatives access,
during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance written notice, to
the Transferred Business, including the Transferred Books and Records, as
Buyer shall from time to time reasonably request in writing; it being
understood that in no event shall Buyer have access to (i) any information
that (x) Seller's counsel advises (after consultation in good faith with
Buyer's counsel) that sharing such information would create any potential
Liability under applicable Laws, including U.S. Antitrust Laws, (y) in the
reasonable judgment of Seller would violate any obligation of Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to disclosure of information or confidentiality
or destroy any legal privilege of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (if, with
respect to confidentiality, Seller has made reasonable efforts to obtain a
waiver regarding the possible disclosure from the third party to whom it owes
an obligation of confidentiality), provided that Seller shall in good faith
use its reasonable best efforts to provide such information in a manner and
form that would not violate any such obligation with respect to disclosure of
information or confidentiality or destroy any such legal privilege, or (z)
that constitutes Customer Proprietary Network Information (other than as
permitted by the rules and regulations of the FCC) or (ii) accountants' work
papers; and it being further understood that Buyer shall reimburse Seller
promptly for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries in complying with any such request by or on behalf of
Buyer; provided further that in the case of competitively sensitive
information, Seller and Buyer shall agree upon mutually acceptable "clean
team" procedures with respect to such information. All information received by
Buyer or its representatives pursuant to this Section 6.1 shall be governed by
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 43  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) (i) Seller shall, at its own expense, make and be responsible for any
notifications and filings by virtue of the transactions set forth herein and
contemplated hereby, required by any Governmental Entity prior to Closing
under the Connecticut Property Transfer Law, §§ 22a-134 - 22a-134e (the
"CPTL") for any Transferred Real Property or any Transferred Lease Real
Property, or the business or operations thereat or therefrom. From and after
Closing, Buyer shall, at its own expense, be responsible for all remaining
CPTL obligations including any notifications, filings, investigations or other
actions or obligations, and Seller shall provide to Buyer all documentation
relevant to or necessary to complete any such matter, and shall cooperate
fully with Buyer and any Governmental Entity for purposes of completing any
such matter. Seller's and Buyer's obligations hereunder shall survive the
Closing until all applicable and appropriate governmental notifications,
approvals and closure with respect to all such matters are completed and
obtained. For avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 6.1(b)(i) shall
affect any claims Buyer may have under Article VIII, including with respect to
any matters arising under Section 4.13.

  

  

(ii) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after
the date of this Agreement, Seller shall provide to Buyer a full listing of
all Transferred Real Property and Transferred Leased Real Property, and any
other locations for which Seller or the Transferred Companies have or may have
liability under the CPTL, as well as a full listing of all such properties
that are not subject to the CPTL for purposes of this provision. With respect
to any properties that are not subject to the CPTL, Buyer may, at its own
expense, through itself or its employees, representatives, engineers,
consultants or agents, may, during regular business hours and upon reasonable
prior notice, and with prior permission and reasonable cooperation of Seller
(which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld) enter into or upon all
or any portion of such Transferred Real Property or Transferred Leased Real
Property, in order to conduct ASTM 1527 Phase I environmental site assessments
to investigate and assess, the environmental condition of such properties or
the business of the Transferred Business (the "Environmental Investigation").
Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with Buyer in
conducting any Environmental Investigation, shall allow Buyer all access as
reasonably required or necessary to such properties and information to conduct
any Environmental Investigation, and shall within sixty (60) days after the
date of this Agreement provide Buyer with copies of any pre-existing
environmental materials, including prior reports, plans, results of
investigations in Seller\'s, any of its Subsidiaries\' or the Transferred
Companies\' possession or reasonable control prior to or at the time of any
such Environmental Investigation. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller Indemnified Parties (which for this purpose shall include the
Transferred Companies) in respect of any direct and actual property damage
resulting from Buyer\'s Environmental Investigation, excluding, however, any
pre-existing conditions, or any contamination, pollution or violations of
Environmental Law revealed by or discovered as a result of any such
Environmental Investigation.

(c) Following the Closing, upon the request of the other party, Buyer and
Seller shall, to the extent permitted by Law, make available to the requesting
party and its representatives (for inspection and copying) all financial, Tax
and other information pertaining to the Transferred Business or the operation
or ownership of the Transferred Business and its assets and liabilities,
Transferred Assets, Assumed Liabilities, Excluded Assets, Excluded Liabilities
and the Business Employees reasonably requested in connection with (i) any
audit or other investigation by any Taxing authority or any required returns,
responses to inquiries, reports or submissions to Governmental Entities
(including reports filed with the SEC, any consolidated financial or statutory
reporting obligations and any Tax Returns or replies to the Tax inquiries of
Seller or its Subsidiaries) with respect to the ILEC Services, the Transferred
Companies, the Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Excluded
Liabilities related to periods prior to the Closing; provided, however, that
Seller shall have no obligation to provide copies of any Consolidated Tax
Return or (ii) any matters relating to insurance coverage, third-party
litigation, claims, proceedings and investigations pertaining to the
Transferred Companies, the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Business, the
ILEC Services or the Assumed Liabilities or Excluded Liabilities, as
applicable, in each case with respect to periods prior to the Closing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall comply with its
obligations under Section 6.5(i).

  

  

(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, Seller
will transfer, or cause to be transferred, to the Transferred Companies the
Transferred Books and Records. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(a), the following
Transferred Books and Records shall not be transferred to the Transferred
Companies: (i) Transferred Books and Records which are integrated into the
Books and Records of any member of Seller Group (the "Integrated Records")
unless requested by Buyer and Buyer reimburses Seller for all reasonable out-
of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller in connection with segregating
any such Integrated Records, (ii) Transferred Books and Records which relate
to any aspect of the ILEC Services for which services are, or will be,
provided under the Ancillary Documents (the "Transition Records"), in which
case such Transition Records will be transferred to the Transferred Companies
from time to time, following the termination of the applicable services,
unless such Transition Records would not otherwise be required to be delivered
pursuant to this Section 6.1(d) (excluding anything contained in this clause
(ii)), and (iii) Transferred Books and Records which are obsolete or otherwise
only of historical significance (and not material to the Transferred Business)
and archived with a third party in accordance with Seller's record retention
policies (the "Archived Records"), unless Buyer reimburses Seller for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller in connection
with providing any such Archived Records.

  

  

(e) Seller will provide the Transferred Companies with reasonable access to
(i) the Transition Records after Closing at the time, and from time to time
during the period, provided in the Ancillary Documents and (ii) the Integrated
Records and the Archived Records for a period of five (5) years following the
Closing Date to the extent such records are reasonably available to Seller; it
being understood that (x) the foregoing shall not require any member of the
Seller Group to retain such records except in accordance with Seller's
ordinary business practices in place from time to time; (y) Seller may redact
information from such records to the extent reasonably necessary to protect
the confidential and proprietary information of Seller and its Affiliates that
is unrelated to the Transferred Business; and (z) Buyer shall reimburse Seller
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller in
connection with providing any such records.

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing,
except (i) as otherwise expressly required by this Agreement, the Ancillary
Documents or the Collective Bargaining Agreements, (ii) as required by any
Governmental Entity or Law, (iii) for actions solely affecting the Excluded
Assets, (iv) for changes in products and services offered by the businesses,
generally, of Seller or its Subsidiaries, but only to the extent that such
action does not, taken together with any benefits of such action and any
related actions, adversely affect the Transferred Business on a net basis, (v)
as set forth on Seller Schedule 6.2(a) or (vi) as Buyer otherwise consents in
writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or
withheld (collectively, clauses (i) through (vi), the "Business Conduct
Exceptions"), Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries providing
the ILEC Services or operating the Transferred Business to, provide the
applicable ILEC Services and operate the Transferred Business in all material
respects, in the Ordinary Course and use commercially reasonable efforts to
preserve, in all material respects, the Transferred Companies, the Transferred
Assets and relationships with the Listed Employees. During the period from the
date of this Agreement until the Closing, except for the Business Conduct
Exceptions, Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, with
respect to the Transferred Business, the ILEC Services, the Transferred
Companies and the Transferred Assets, as applicable:

(provided that such obsolete equipment is no longer in use in the support of
customers in any manner, whether in call centers, IT, network, production of
products or services or otherwise), in the Ordinary Course, or upon expiration
of any leases for any such assets, and other than Permitted Encumbrances;
provided, however, that in no circumstance shall vehicles comprising part of
the Transferred Business (other than obsolete vehicles and leased vehicles
with respect to which the underlying lease has expired) be sold, leased,
transferred, disposed of or encumbered without Buyer's written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld);

(B)

  |

this Agreement a Material Contract (other than a Contract that would not be a
Material Contract but for Section 4.15(a)(vii) and for this purpose replacing
the reference to $2.5 million in Section 4.15(a)(iii) with $1 million), in
each case other than Contracts with customers for the provision by Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries of goods or services, unless such Contract
disproportionately adversely affects the Transferred Business in the Territory
compared to other geographic locations in which the Seller or its Subsidiaries
operate or conduct business; and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
renew or give notice of renewal for a renewal period of not more than two
years for any leases with respect to any Transferred Real Property Leases
which may expire prior to Closing or for which Seller or its Subsidiaries are

Real Property Leases would otherwise expire unless renewed or such notice is
given;

(i) increase materially the compensation of such Listed Employees individually
or in the aggregate, except in the Ordinary Course or pursuant to the terms of
the Collective Bargaining Agreements or any agreements or plans currently in

Seller may increase benefits for Listed Employees as a result of the amendment
of any Seller Benefit Plan to the extent such increase applies generally to
participants under such Seller Benefit Plan, including a substantial number of
employees who are similarly situated to the Listed Employees but are not
Listed Employees), or (ii) enter into any new employment or severance
agreements with any such Listed Employee;

(G)

  |  

not alter or amend the list of Listed Employees classified as Level 3 or

new employees or transfers between the Transferred Business and the Seller or
its Subsidiaries (but disregarding terminations for cause in accordance with
Seller's established standards and voluntary resignations and retirements)
without Buyer's written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
delayed, conditioned or withheld), provided, however, that Seller may replace
Listed Employees classified as Level 3 or above whose employment terminates in
accordance with this provision in the Ordinary Course;

(b) Prior to making any written communications to the directors, officers or
employees of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or
benefit matters that are affected by the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Buyer shall provide Seller with a copy of any written communication
Buyer intends to make, and Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in providing any
such communication, subject to the approval of Seller, which approval shall
not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld; provided that Buyer may
communicate with CWA representatives in relation to Buyer's duties under the
Collective Bargaining Agreements; and provided, further, that prior to making
such communication, Buyer shall inform Seller of the existence of the planned
communication and shall coordinate with Seller on the content and timing of
the communication, and Buyer and Seller will cooperate with respect to
information that will facilitate Buyer's ability to communicate effectively as
described in Buyer Schedule 6.2(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may
provide notices to Listed Employees relating to the Successor Individual
Account Plans pursuant to Section 404(c) of ERISA; and the parties shall
cooperate in the notices' timely distribution. The parties shall each
designate a single point of contact to facilitate prompt approvals of
communications.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall take all
necessary actions to transfer the sponsorship of the Company Plans and all
related trusts and Liabilities to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller other than

6.3 Reasonable Best Efforts; Governmental Consents.

  

  

(a) Each of Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to consummate as promptly as practicable the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including fulfilling the
conditions precedent to the other party's obligations hereunder, and securing
as promptly as practicable all consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
it being understood that nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be
construed to require, (i) Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to (A) make any
payment in connection with fulfilling such conditions precedent, other than
legal and accounting fees and disbursements and regulatory filing fees and
costs, or (B) take or refrain from taking any action, agree to any restriction
or condition or enter into any agreement with respect to any of their assets
or operations other than the Transferred Business (a "Seller Adverse
Condition") or (C) request any consent from any third party if such consent is
not material to the ILEC Services taken as a whole and Seller reasonably
believes that such request would materially adversely affect Seller's
relationship with such third party with respect to any of Seller's businesses
other than the ILEC Services or (ii) Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to take
or refrain from taking any action that would reasonably be expected to have a
Buyer Adverse Condition. "Buyer Adverse Condition" means a Seller Material
Adverse Effect (disregarding the provisos in the definition thereof) or any
action, restriction, condition or requirement which would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the Buyer
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (with materiality being measured for
such purposes in relation to the financial condition, properties, assets,
liabilities, business or results of operations of the Transferred Business,
taken as a whole, rather than that of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole) disregarding for this purpose any condition or requirement that is
consistent with the manner in which Buyer operates its and its Subsidiaries'
existing telecommunications businesses as of the date of this Agreement, or
expects, as of the date of this Agreement, to operate the Transferred Business
(not taking into account (i) any expectations Buyer may have with respect to
any regulatory conditions or requirements that may be imposed in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) any investments
in infrastructure in connection with obtaining regulatory approval in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer and Seller will make all
filings and submissions required by the U.S. Antitrust Laws, the FCC, and any
State Commission within thirty (30) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement and promptly file any additional information requested as soon as
reasonably practicable after receipt of such request therefor (provided that
any failure to make such filings within thirty (30) Business Days after the
date of this Agreement shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement so long
as such filings are made as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter). To
the extent that, as an accommodation to Buyer and with Buyer's prior written
consent, Seller or any of its Subsidiaries incurs costs that Buyer otherwise
would have to incur in order to secure any consent, approval, waiver or
authorization, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for any such costs that
are invoiced by Seller to Buyer.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (including
Section 6.3(a)), without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant
to this Section 6.3, each of Seller and Buyer agree to take or cause to be
taken the following actions: (i) the prompt provision to each and every
federal, state, or local Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over
enforcement of any applicable antitrust or competition Laws or state or
federal telecommunication Laws (including multi-channel video and including
any state, local municipal or county franchise authorities with respect to
video franchises) of non-privileged information and documents requested by any
such Governmental Entity or that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents; (ii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to
avoid the entry of any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other
order, decree, decision, determination or judgment that would reasonably be
likely to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents, including the defense through litigation on the merits of any claim
asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding by any person or entity,
including any Governmental Entity, seeking to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin
or otherwise prohibit consummation of such transactions; and (iii) the prompt
use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in the event that any permanent,
preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination
or decree is entered or issued, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be
entered or issued, in any proceeding or inquiry of any kind that would make
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents unlawful or that
would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Termination Date, any
and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or in the
case of Buyer, the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (ii) of this
paragraph) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent,
eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination or decree so as to permit such
consummation prior to the Termination Date.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (including
Section 6.3(a)), Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other and shall
furnish to each other all information necessary or desirable in connection
with making any filing under the HSR Act and for any application or other
filing to be made pursuant to any competition or state, local or federal
telecommunications or franchising Law, or in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry by any Governmental Entity or any consumer
advocate which is, or may reasonably be expected to be, a party to a
proceeding before a Governmental Entity (or any third-party consultant or
advisor to any of the foregoing) under any competition or state, local or
federal telecommunications or franchising Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents. Each
of Buyer and Seller shall promptly inform the other of any communication with,
and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any
Governmental Entity or any consumer advocate or third-party consultant or
advisor to any of the foregoing regarding any such filings or any such
transaction. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall participate in any substantive
meeting (in person or by telephone) with any Governmental Entity or any
consumer advocate or third-party consultant or advisor to any of the foregoing
in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry without giving
the other party prior notice of, and the opportunity to participate in, the
meeting to the extent reasonably practicable. To the extent permitted by Law
and reasonably practicable, the parties will consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party in connection with all meetings, actions and
proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or other competition or state,
local or federal telecommunications or franchising Laws (including, with
respect to making a particular filing, by providing copies of all such
documents to the non-filing party and their advisors prior to making such
filing and, if requested, giving due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith).

  

  

6.4 Control of Business Pending the Closing. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly, any right to control or
direct the operations of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing.

  

  

6.5 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Seller Liability for Taxes. Subject to Section 6.5(o), Seller hereby
agrees that from and after the Closing it shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from, against, and in respect of any
Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, any such Buyer Indemnified
Party based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of: (i) Taxes
imposed on any of the Transferred Companies under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 (and any comparable provision of state, local, or foreign Law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise, for Taxes of any Person
other than a Transferred Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (ii) Taxes
based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of the Section
338(h)(10) Election, other than Section 338(h)(10) State Taxes for which Buyer
is responsible under Section 6.5(p)(iii), (iii) Taxes imposed on any of the
Transferred Companies or the Transferred Business with respect to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period; (iv) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty contained in Section 4.9 (disregarding for these purposes any
qualification or exception for, or reference to, materiality or Seller
Material Adverse Effect set forth therein); (v) any withholding Taxes imposed
on the payment of the Purchase Price as a method for collecting a Tax payable
by Seller under applicable law or this Agreement (excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, withholding Taxes that represent a mechanism to collect a Transfer
Tax which Buyer and Seller have agreed to share pursuant to Section 6.5(e));
(vi) Transfer Taxes for which Seller is responsible pursuant to Section
6.5(e); and (vii) Taxes directly or indirectly arising from, related to or
attributable to (A) the Pre-Closing Reorganization or the transfer of property
after the Closing, or (B) the breach or nonperformance of any covenant or
agreement of Seller or any of its Affiliates contained in this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 51  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Buyer Liability for Taxes. Buyer hereby agrees that from and after the
Closing it shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified
Parties from, against, and in respect of any Losses incurred or sustained by,
or imposed upon, any such Seller Indemnified Party based upon, arising out of,
with respect to or by reason of: (i) Taxes imposed on any of the Transferred
Companies with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period; (ii) Section 338(h)(10)
State Taxes for which Buyer is responsible under Section 6.5(p)(iii); (iii)
Transfer Taxes for which Buyer is responsible pursuant to Section 6.5(e); and

nonperformance of any covenant or agreement of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
contained in this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Proration of Taxes.

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

With respect to a Straddle Period, the Taxes that shall be treated as
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined as follows: (a)
to the extent such Tax is calculated on an annual basis, whether or not the
lien date, or valuation date, begins within the taxable year, such as property
tax, such Tax shall be prorated based on the number of days in such taxable
period up to and including the Closing Date, and (b) to the extent such Tax is
measured by income or receipts or otherwise not described in (a), above, such
Tax shall be allocated based on a closing of the books on the Closing Date
with respect to the Transferred Companies.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the
portion of any such Taxes that shall be treated as attributable to a Post-
Closing Tax Period shall be all such Taxes other than the Taxes attributable
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to Section 6.5(c)(i) hereof.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

To the extent permitted under applicable Law, the parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to terminate the taxable year of the
Transferred Companies on the Closing Date.

(i)

  |  

Seller shall have the sole and exclusive right to prepare and file all
required Consolidated Tax Returns. Seller shall timely pay or cause to be paid
all Taxes shown to be due on any Consolidated Tax Returns to the extent
attributable to the Transferred Companies or the Transferred Business. Such
Consolidated Tax Returns, to the extent they include the Transferred Companies
or the Transferred Business, shall, with respect to any asset of the
Transferred Companies or the Transferred Business, (i) be prepared consistent
with the Fixed Asset Reports (as updated to reflect the assets of Transferred
Companies and Transferred Business for such period) and (ii) use the cost
recovery method historically used with respect to any such asset, except to
the extent otherwise required by applicable Law.

timely filed all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect
to all Transferred Companies or the Transferred Business for Pre-Closing Tax

a manner consistent with all positions taken, methods used, and elections made
in prior periods in filing such Tax Returns; provided that: (A) before filing
any such Tax Return, Buyer shall provide Seller with a copy of such Tax Return
(or a pro forma Tax Return solely related to the Transferred Companies in the
case of any consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary Tax Return that
includes Buyer or any of its Affiliates) at least thirty (30) days prior to
the last date for timely filing such Tax Return (giving effect to any valid
extensions thereof) accompanied by a statement setting forth Seller's
indemnification obligation, if any, pursuant to Section 6.5(a); (B) Buyer
shall consider the reasonable comments of Seller to such Tax Returns and shall
not withhold incorporation of such comments to the extent doing so would not

pursuant to Section 6.5(a) related to such Tax Returns within a reasonable
time for the filing of such Tax Returns; (D) no such Tax Return shall be filed

(e) Transfer Taxes. Seller and Buyer shall each bear one half of any Transfer
Taxes. Any Transfer Taxes resulting from any transfer of Transferred Assets to
the Transferred Companies, or any transfer of Excluded Assets to Seller or its
Subsidiaries, pursuant to Section 10.9 after the Closing shall be borne by
Seller. Buyer and Seller will cooperate in the preparation and filing of any
Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes, and join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns or other documentation, as applicable. Any Tax Returns that

the party primarily or customarily responsible under applicable Law for filing
such Tax Returns, and such party will use its reasonable best efforts to
provide such Tax Returns to the other party for review and comments at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to the date such Tax Returns are due to be filed.

(i)

receipt of notice of any pending or threatened audits or assessments with

in the proceedings related to such Tax proceeding, (B) Seller shall keep the
Buyer Indemnified Parties reasonably and timely informed with respect to the
commencement, status and nature of such Tax proceeding, (C) Seller shall

not settle, compromise or dispose of such Tax proceeding if such settlement,
compromise or disposition would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
Tax liability of the Buyer Indemnified Parties in a Post-Closing Tax Period
without the consent of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided, however, that with
respect to Consolidated Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, only
clause (D) above shall apply.

(iii)

  |  

With respect to any Tax proceeding related to a Straddle Period (other than a
Tax with respect to a Consolidated Tax Return), Buyer shall have the right to
control all proceedings and may make any decisions in connection with any Tax
proceeding related to such Straddle Period; provided, however, that, (A)
Seller may at its own expense participate in the proceedings related to such
Tax proceeding, (B) Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably and timely informed
with respect to the commencement, status and nature of such Tax proceeding,
and (C) Buyer shall not settle, compromise or dispose of such Tax proceeding
without the consent of Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iv)

  |  

The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have the right to control all proceedings
and may make any decisions in connection with all Tax proceedings for Post-
Closing Tax Periods that do not include a Straddle Period.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(g) Refunds. If, after the Closing, Buyer or its Affiliates (A) receive any
refund, or (B) utilize the benefit of any overpayment or prepayment of Taxes
which, in either of cases (A) and (B), (x) relate to a Tax paid by Seller or
any of its Affiliates, or (y) is the subject of indemnification by Seller
hereunder, Buyer shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, to
Seller the entire amount of the refund or overpayment (including interest)
received or utilized by Buyer or its Affiliates, net of any Taxes or other
costs incurred by Buyer or its Affiliates attributable to the receipt of such
refund. Buyer agrees to notify Seller promptly of both the discovery of a
right to claim any such refund or overpayment and the receipt of any such
refund or utilization of any such overpayment. Buyer agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to claim any such refund or to utilize any
such overpayment as soon as possible and to furnish to Seller all information,
records and assistance necessary to verify the amount of the refund or
overpayment, provided, that Buyer shall be permitted to use its own Tax
attributes prior to utilizing such overpayment described in this Section
6.5(g).

  

  

(h) Assistance and Cooperation.

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

From and after the Closing, the parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in preparing for any audits
of, or disputes with Taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns involving
the Transferred Companies or Transferred Business and payments in respect
thereof. Such cooperation shall include, upon such other party's request, the
provision of records and information reasonably relevant to the Transferred
Companies or Transferred Business and any related Tax Returns or Tax
proceedings and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder; provided, however, that Seller shall have no obligation to provide
Buyer copies of any Consolidated Tax Returns. Each party shall (i) provide
timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or proposed audits or
assessments with respect to (A) Taxes for which such other party or any of its
Affiliates may have a liability under this Agreement or (B) an item that could
affect the Tax basis of the other party in any asset of a Transferred Company
or the Transferred Business, and (ii) furnish the other with copies of all
relevant correspondence received from any Taxing authority in connection with
any audit or information request with respect to any Taxes referred to in (i)
above. The parties shall promptly provide each other with written notice
setting forth the details of any Final Determination that results in a change
to the Tax basis or to the depreciable or amortizable life of any asset of a
Transferred Company or the Transferred Business to the extent such adjustment
could reasonably be expected to impact the Taxes of the other party.

Page 55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

Promptly after Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer, in a medium reasonably
requested by Buyer, copies of the Fixed Asset Reports and deferred tax
balances underlying the Financial Statements, in each case, updated to reflect
the assets of the Transferred Companies or Transferred Business as of the
Closing. Seller shall use commercially reasonably efforts to cooperate with
Buyer, as and to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, in preparing a
reconciliation of such Fixed Asset Reports to the Financial Statements;
provided, however, that Seller shall have no obligation to provide Buyer any
privileged or proprietary information or analysis.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(i) Maintenance of Buyer's Books and Records. Until the later of seven (7)
years following the Closing and the applicable statute of limitations
(including periods of waiver) has run for any Tax Returns filed or required to
be filed covering the periods up to and including the Closing Date, Buyer and
Seller shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, retain all Books
and Records related to the Transferred Business and Transferred Companies and
after the Closing Date will provide the other party access to such Books and
Records for inspection and copying by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, or its
respective agents and representatives upon reasonable request and upon
reasonable notice. After the expiration of such period, no Books and Records
referred to in the previous sentence shall be destroyed without first advising
the other party in writing and giving such party a reasonable opportunity to
obtain possession thereof, with any costs of transferring such Books and
Records to be paid by the party requesting such books and records; provided,
however, that Seller shall have no obligation to provide Buyer copies of any
Consolidated Tax Returns.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 56  

  

 

 

 

  

(j) Tax Sharing Agreements. As of the Closing Date and, after the Closing
Date, none of the Transferred Companies shall be bound by or have any
liability under any Tax sharing agreements with respect to or involving the
Transferred Companies.

  

  

(k) Survival. The indemnification obligations pursuant to this Section 6.5
shall survive the Closing until ninety (90) days following the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations (including any extensions thereof)
relevant to each particular item including any indemnification obligation
arising from a breach of the representations and warranties contained in
Section 4.9 (Taxes); provided that if notice of indemnification under Section
6.5(f)(i) is provided to the indemnifying party prior to any such expiration
date, any obligation to indemnify for any claim described in such notice shall
continue indefinitely until such claim is finally resolved.

  

  

(l) Timing of Payments. The Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 6.5 promptly following receipt from an Indemnified
Party of a claim for a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder,
unless and for so long as the Indemnifying Party in good faith disputes the
Loss in which event it shall so notify the Indemnified Party. In any event,
the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the amount of any Loss for which it is liable
hereunder no later than ten (10) Business Days following any Final
Determination of such Loss and the Indemnifying Party's liability therefor. A
"Final Determination" shall exist when (i) the parties to the dispute have
reached an agreement in writing, (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction shall
have entered a final and non-appealable order or judgment, or (iii) an
arbitration or like panel shall have rendered a final non-appealable
determination with respect to disputes the parties have agreed to submit
thereto.

  

  

(m) Characterization of Indemnification Payments. Except as otherwise required
by Law, all payments made by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party in
respect of any claim pursuant to this Section 6.5 hereof shall be treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

  

  

(n) Tax Benefits. Subject to Section 6.5(o), nothing herein shall prevent an
Indemnifying Party from asserting that the amount of Loss incurred by an
Indemnified Party under Section 6.5(a) or Section 6.5(b) for which
indemnification is sought hereunder may take into account any net Tax benefit
actually realized by such Indemnified Party as a result of incurring such
Loss; it being understood that any such assertion shall not be dispositive in
determining the amount of such Loss.

  

  

(o) Special Rules for Asset Basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 6.5, (i) Seller shall have no liability under this Section 6.5
for Losses incurred with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period (other than
penalties in respect of Taxes) attributable to a Post-Closing Change in
Recoverable Life and (ii) Seller shall not be entitled to assert under Section
6.5(n) that a Loss for which Seller is otherwise liable under Section 6.5(a)
should be reduced to take into account any increase in the basis of any asset
of the Transferred Companies or Transferred Business on account of a Post-
Closing Change in Recoverable Life. A "Post-Closing Change in Recoverable
Life" means, with respect to any asset held by the Transferred Companies or
Transferred Business on the Closing Date, a Final Determination after the
Closing Date pursuant to which the recoverable life of any such asset for
purposes of tax depreciation is determined to be longer than the recoverable
life reported by Seller, the Transferred Companies, or Transferred Business
with respect to such asset for a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(p) Section 338(h)(10) Election.

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

Buyer and Seller agree to treat the purchase of SAI as a "qualified stock
purchase" within the meaning of section 338(d)(3) of the Code and shall make a
joint election under section 338(h)(10) of the Code, and comparable state and
local Tax provisions, with respect to such purchase (the "Section 338(h)(10)
Election"). At the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall exchange properly completed
and executed originals of IRS Form 8023 and any similar state or local forms,
and required schedules thereto, containing information available at such time.
If any changes are required in the forms as a result of information which is
first available after such forms are prepared, Buyer and Seller will promptly
agree on such changes. After all required schedules to support the forms are
completed, Buyer and Seller shall file the forms, which filing shall be made
within the time period specified under applicable Law. Buyer and Seller and
their affiliates shall make all required filings relating to the Section
338(h)(10) Election in connection with their federal and applicable state and
local income Tax Returns, and shall cooperate fully with each other to take
all other actions necessary and appropriate otherwise to effect, perfect and
timely preserve the Section 338(h)(10) Election.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

Within 90 days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) draft a schedule
(the "SAI Allocation Schedule") setting forth (A) the amount of the Purchase
Price to be allocated between SAI (the "SAI Portion") and SNET and (B)
allocating the "adjusted deemed sales price" (as required under Section
1.338(h)(10)-1 of the Treasury regulations) with respect to the SAI Portion
among the assets of SAI and (ii) deliver such SAI Allocation Schedule to
Seller. The SAI Allocation Schedule shall be reasonable and shall be prepared
in accordance with Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the Treasury regulations
thereunder. If Seller believes that all or a portion of the SAI Allocation
Schedule is incorrect and Seller notifies Buyer in a writing including a
description of the objection and basis supporting the Seller's objections and
any calculations or documentation that support the objection, within 30
(thirty) days after having received the SAI Allocation Schedule, Buyer and
Seller agree to consult and resolve in good faith any such disputed item. In
the event the parties are unable to resolve any such dispute within 30
(thirty) days following notice to Buyer of Seller's objection (in the form and
within the time set forth herein), a nationally-recognized accounting firm
will be retained to resolve solely any issue in dispute as promptly as
possible and the determination of such firm shall be final with respect to
such disputed issues. Buyer and Seller shall then be bound by the SAI
Allocation Schedule as adjusted to reflect the determination, if any, of the
accounting firm (the "SAI Final Allocation Schedule"). In the event that Final
Net Working Capital is determined after delivery of the SAI Allocation
Schedule, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to revise such schedule to take
into account the portion of such Final Net Working Capital allocable to SAI.
Each of Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer on the other hand, shall report the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and file all Tax Returns, in each
case, for federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes in accordance with
the SAI Final Allocation Schedule.

(iii)

  |  

Buyer hereby agrees that from and after the Closing it shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from, against, and in respect
of any Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, any such Seller
Indemnified Party based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of
any Section 338(h)(10) State Taxes. The "Section 338(h)(10) State Taxes" shall
equal (x) the excess of (i) the state income Taxes imposed upon Seller with
respect to the Section 338(h)(10) Election herewith over (ii) the amount of
state income Taxes that would have been imposed on the Seller with respect to
the sale of the SAI shares herewith had the Section 338(h)(10) Election not
been made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the SAI Portion is not
greater than $115,000,000, the amount of such indemnity shall not exceed
$7,000,000. In the event the SAI Portion is greater than $115,000,000 the
amount of such indemnity shall not exceed the sum of (x) $7,000,000 plus (y)
the difference between the SAI Portion and $115,000,000, multiplied by 4.875%.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iv)

  |  

Neither Buyer nor any Seller shall take any action, whether before or after
Closing, that could reasonably be expected to cause the purchase and sale of
the stock of SAI contemplated by this Agreement not to be treated as a taxable
stock purchase and sale with respect to which a Section 338(h)(10) Election
may be made.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(q) Exclusivity. All issues relating to indemnification for the Tax matters
addressed by Section 6.5(a) and Section 6.5(b) and Section 6.5(p) shall be
governed exclusively by the provisions of this Section 6.5 and not Article
VIII, including a breach of the representations and warranties contained in
Section 4.9 (Taxes). For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification
obligations under Section 6.5(a) and Section 6.5(b) and Section 6.5(p) shall
not be subject to the limits on indemnity in Article VIII.

6.6 Post-Closing Obligations to Business Employees.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, (i) the employment of each Listed Employee who
is not a Retained Employee and who is not already employed by a Transferred
Company shall (unless such person has ceased to be employed by Seller or its
Subsidiaries prior thereto) be transferred to, and each such employee shall
become an employee of a Transferred Company, without any interruption or
cessation of employment or break in service, and (ii) the employment of each
Retained Employee who is employed by a Transferred Company as of the date of
this Agreement shall (unless such person has ceased to be employed by a
Transferred Company prior thereto) be transferred from, and each such employee
shall cease to be an employee of, a Transferred Company, without any
interruption or cessation of employment or break in service. For the avoidance
of doubt, each Business Employee will remain on any Seller payroll and
participate in the Seller Benefit Plans through 11:59 PM Connecticut time on
the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) Effective immediately after the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume the
obligations of the Seller and/or the Transferred Companies under the
Collective Bargaining Agreements. Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
provide Business Employees who are covered by the Collective Bargaining
Agreements (the "Union Employees") with compensation and benefits required by
the Collective Bargaining Agreements; provided, however, nothing in this
Agreement is intended to limit or restrict the right of Buyer or any
Transferred Company to renegotiate or terminate any of the Collective
Bargaining Agreements in accordance with applicable Law. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Section 6.6, effective immediately following the
Closing Date, (i) Seller shall cause the Transferred Companies to terminate
their participation in each of the Seller Benefit Plans, and (ii) no Business
Employee shall be entitled to receive or accrue any benefits under any such
Seller Benefit Plans with respect to services rendered or compensation paid
after the Closing Date.

  

  

(c) Buyer shall give Business Employees full credit for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit level and accrual, in each case under the
employee benefit plans, employee arrangements, policies and programs
(including pension plans, savings plans, paid time off, severance, vacation,
sick leave and health and welfare benefits) maintained by the Buyer or its
Affiliates, in which such Business Employees participate, for such Business
Employees' service with the Seller or its Affiliates or predecessors to the
same extent recognized by the Seller up to and including the Closing Date.
With respect to any welfare benefit plans maintained by Buyer for the benefit
of Business Employees after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, for the year of
Closing, (i) waive any eligibility and participation requirements or pre-
existing condition limitations to the same extent previously met or waived
under comparable plans of the Seller and (ii) give effect, in determining any
deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to amounts paid by such
Business Employees with respect to similar plans maintained by Seller. No
Business Employee shall be eligible to receive severance benefits under the
ATandT Inc. Management Severance Plan or a severance pay plan of Buyer as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Buyer agrees that, during the period commencing immediately following the
Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall provide Business Employees other than Union Employees with (i) base
compensation and incentive opportunities that are at least equal to the base
compensation and incentive opportunities provided to each Business Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits on the same
terms as those provided under the employee benefit plans, agreements,
programs, policies and arrangements of Buyer, but the employee benefits for
Business Employees shall be at least substantially comparable in the aggregate
to employee benefits under the Seller Benefit Plans for these employees on the
Closing Date of this Agreement, subject to the following special rules: (A) if
employee benefits under the Seller's Benefit Plans are reduced for the year
that begins after the Closing Date, Buyer may make a corresponding reduction
in the Business Employee's employee benefits for the portion of the 12-month
period that occurs during such year and (B) employee benefits under the ATandT
CarePlus - A Supplemental Medical Plan or any Seller nonqualified deferred
compensation plan shall be disregarded in determining comparability. Buyer
shall assume the Liability for the payment of annual cash incentive awards for
the year in which the Closing occurs in accordance with the provisions set
forth on Seller Schedule 6.6(d). Buyer shall, for a period ending not earlier
than the first anniversary of the Closing Date, maintain a severance pay
practice for the benefit of each Business Employee that is no less favorable
than the severance pay practice provided by Seller or any of its Affiliates to
such Business Employee as of the date of this Agreement. Buyer shall assume
all liabilities and obligations to provide any applicable severance to any
Business Employee whose employment is terminated by Buyer or its Affiliates
following the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 60  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) Buyer and Seller agree to take the actions set forth on Seller Schedule
6.6(e).

  

  

(f) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall (i) cause the trustee of the ATandT
Retirement Savings Plan and the ATandT Savings and Security Plan (the
"Individual Account Plans") to segregate the assets of such Individual Account
Plans representing the full account balances of Business Employees as of the
Closing Date, (ii) make any and all filings and submissions to the appropriate
Governmental Entities arising in connection with such segregation of assets
and the transfer of assets as described below, (iii) make all necessary
amendments to the Individual Account Plans and related trust agreement to
provide for such segregation of assets and the transfer of assets as described
below, and (iv) provide Buyer with a copy of the most recent determination
letter from the IRS regarding the qualified status of the Individual Account
Plans. As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall maintain an individual account plan
or plans and an associated trust or trusts for the benefit of Business
Employees (the "Successor Individual Account Plans"), shall take all necessary
action, if any, to preserve the qualification of such plan under the
applicable provisions of the Code and shall make any and all filings and
submissions to the appropriate Governmental Entities required to be made by it
in connection with the transfer of assets described below. As soon as
practicable (but no later than forty-five (45) days) following the later of
the Closing Date and the date Buyer provides Seller with a copy of the most
recent determination letter from the IRS regarding the qualified status of the
Successor Individual Account Plans, Seller shall cause the trustee of the
Individual Account Plans to transfer in the form of cash (or promissory notes
to the extent of account balances that represent outstanding loans of the
Business Employees) the full account balances of the Business Employees under
the Individual Account Plans (which account balances will have been credited
with appropriate earnings attributable to the period up to and including the
date of transfer described herein), reduced by any necessary benefit or
withdrawal payments to or in respect of Business Employees occurring during
the period up to and including the date of transfer described herein, to the
appropriate trustee as designated by Buyer under the trust agreement forming a
part of the Successor Individual Account Plans; provided, however, such
transferred amounts shall only be transferred in accordance with Section
414(l) of the Code and all other applicable Law. In consideration for the
transfer of assets described herein, Buyer shall, effective as of the date of
transfer described herein, assume all of the obligations of Seller or Seller's
Individual Account Plans in respect of the account balances accumulated by
Business Employees under the Individual Account Plans (exclusive of any
portion of such account balances which are paid or otherwise withdrawn prior
to the date of transfer described herein) on or prior to the Closing Date.
Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall assume any other obligations or
liabilities arising under or attributable to the Individual Account Plans.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 61  

  

 

 

 

  

(g) In respect of the Seller Benefit Plans, (i) Seller shall retain
responsibility for and continue to pay all medical, life insurance, disability
and other welfare plan expenses and benefits for each current or former
employee of the Transferred Companies with respect to claims incurred by such
employees or their covered dependents on or prior to the Closing Date
(including assuming responsibility for any related disputes) and (ii) expenses
and benefits with respect to claims incurred by Business Employees or their
covered dependents after the Closing Date (and related disputes) shall be the
responsibility of Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree to
take the actions set forth on Buyer Schedule 6.6(g) with respect to flexible
spending accounts and health reimbursement arrangements under the Seller
Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Section 6.6(g), a claim is deemed incurred
in the case of medical, dental or vision coverage when the services are
performed or goods provided that are the subject of the claim (except that, in
the case of a hospital stay, a claim is incurred when the employee first
enters the hospital); in the case of life insurance, when the death occurs;
and in the case of short-term and long-term disability benefits, when the
disability occurs. All rules related to recurring or successive disabilities
under the Seller Benefit Plans shall be taken into account in determining when
a disability occurs for purposes of this Section 6.6(g). Accordingly, a
recurrence or successive disability that would be treated as a continuance of
the same disability or disability period (under the terms of the Seller
Benefit Plans in effect on the date of this Agreement) shall be a treated as a
continuance (and not a new or separate disability) for purposes of this
Section 6.6(g).

  

  

(h) Buyer shall assume any liability under Title X of the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), or other applicable
Law relating to the provision of group health plan continuation ("Other
Continuation") arising from the actions (or inactions) of Buyer or its
Affiliates following the Closing Date. Seller shall retain all liability with
respect to the provision of continuation coverage under COBRA and for Other
Continuation for all Seller employees who incurred qualifying events prior to
or on the Closing Date, and who are still eligible to receive such COBRA or
Other Continuation as of or after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, no provision of this Agreement and no actions taken by Seller or its
Affiliates or Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause a termination of employment of any
Business Employee or shall cause any Business Employee to be entitled to COBRA
coverage as of the Closing Date.

  

  

(i) Pension Transfer.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 62  

  

 

 

 

  

(i) Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall establish or maintain a qualified
defined benefit pension plan or a portion of a qualified defined benefit plan
(the "Buyer Pension Plan") that is identical in all material respects with the
benefits, terms and conditions of the qualified defined benefit pension plan
maintained for the Business Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date
(the "Pension Plan"), for purposes of assuming the liabilities and providing
pension benefits in respect of the Business Employees and make any and all
filings and submissions to the appropriate Governmental Entities required to
be made by it in connection with the transfer of assets described below and
agrees to maintain such pension plan (including providing additional benefit
accruals) (i) as required by the Collective Bargaining Agreements and (ii)
otherwise for a period of not less than eighteen (18) months. The
participation by Business Employees in the Pension Plan shall cease as of
11:59 PM Connecticut time on the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer shall provide Seller a copy of Buyer's most recent determination letter
from the IRS with respect to the qualified status of the Buyer Pension Plan,
and Seller shall provide Buyer with a copy of the most recent determination
letter from the IRS with respect to the qualified status of the Pension Plan.
Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate to satisfy the Pension Plan
trustee and Buyer Pension Plan trustee in connection with such transfer.
Subject to the transfer of the Initial Pension Plan Transfer Amount, effective
immediately following the Closing Date, the Buyer Pension Plan shall be
responsible for all liabilities for the benefits payable for Business
Employees immediately following the Closing Date under the terms of the
Pension Plan and all benefit payments to Business Employees shall be made from
the Buyer Pension Plan. Effective immediately following the Closing Date, the
Pension Plan shall be liable to the Buyer Pension Plan for the "Pension
Transfer Amount," which shall be an amount equal to the aggregate present
value of accrued vested and nonvested benefits under the Pension Plan of the
Business Employees up to and including the Closing Date, determined on a
projected benefit obligation basis by an actuary retained by Seller ("Seller's
Actuary") utilizing the current GAAP assumptions used in Seller's Form 10-K
filing that most recently precedes the Closing Date (except for the discount
rate and interest rate sensitive assumptions set forth on Seller Schedule
6.6(i)(i)), provided, however, that in no event shall the amount so determined
and transferred from the Pension Plan be in excess of the amount permitted to
be transferred in accordance with Section 414(l) of the Code (as determined in
accordance with the provisions set forth on Seller Schedule 6.6(i)(i)). Any
amount that would have been transferred but for the preceding proviso shall be
paid by Seller to Buyer, and Buyer shall contribute the entire amount to the
Buyer Pension Plan as soon as practicable. In consideration of (x) the
transfer of the Initial Pension Plan Transfer Amount, and (y) the Seller's
agreement to the transfer of the Pension Transfer Amount, adjusted for
interest or earnings using the discount rate set forth on Seller Schedule
6.6(i)(i) as of the Closing Date, the Buyer Pension Plan shall, immediately
following the Closing Date, assume all liabilities for benefits payable to the
Business Employees pursuant to the terms of the Pension Plan (such
liabilities, the "Assumed Pension Plan Liabilities") and the Pension Plan
shall have no further obligations for such amounts. On the first Business Day
following the Closing Date, Seller shall transfer or cause the Pension Plan to
transfer assets in cash, in an amount equal to 90% of a good faith estimate of
the Pension Transfer Amount (the "Initial Pension Plan Transfer Amount") for
Business Employees, to Buyer's Pension Plan, as determined by Seller as of the
Closing Date. The remainder of the Pension Transfer Amount (the "Remaining
Pension Plan Transfer Amount") for Business Employees in cash, shall be
transferred as soon as reasonably practical following the Closing Date (but in
no event later than one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing Date).
In the event that the Remaining Pension Plan Transfer Amount is a negative
amount, then Buyer shall transfer or cause to be transferred from the Buyer
Pension Plan back to the Pension Plan such amount in cash. Buyer agrees that
the pension plan benefits provided to Business Employees under the Buyer
Pension Plan as of the Closing Date shall be no less favorable than the
benefits provided to the Business Employees under the Pension Plan immediately
prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

(ii) The actuary retained by the Buyer (the "Buyer's Actuary" and, together
with Seller's Actuary, the "Actuaries") shall have the right to review and
approve any actuarial or other calculations performed by the Seller's Actuary
which relates to this Section 6.6(i) and shall have the right to examine the
materials used (except proprietary systems and software) or produced in
connection with any actuarial or other calculation performed by the Seller's
Actuary, excluding any estimates or analyses previously prepared by Seller's
Actuary in connection with the planning or negotiation of this Agreement (but
if those are the only analyses that reflect materially changed data or
assumptions, Seller shall take reasonable steps to provide Buyer's Actuary
with information sufficient to permit Buyer's Actuary to assess the impact of
the changed data or assumptions). Buyer's Actuary shall notify Seller's
Actuary in writing of Buyer's Actuary's disagreement with any calculation made
by Seller's Actuary pursuant to this Section 6.6(i) within thirty (30) days
from the date Buyer's Actuary receives the calculation from the Seller's
Actuary and (in a format that is readily electronically readable) all related
data necessary for Buyer's actuary to analyze the calculation. If no such
notice is provided by Buyer's Actuary within the 30-day period, Seller's
Actuary's calculations shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties.
Buyer's Actuary shall not be entitled to object to the determinations of
Seller's Actuary based on any disagreement as to the interest rates,
assumptions or methods used by Seller's Actuary. Buyer's Actuary shall be
entitled to assume that actuarial calculations are based on correct and
complete data and, therefore, if there is any subsequent change in the data
that would reasonably be expected to have a financial impact exceeding $1
million, Seller and Buyer intend for there to be a net adjustment. If there is
any good faith dispute between Seller's Actuary and Buyer's Actuary with
respect to any actuarial or other calculation which continues after Seller's
Actuary has considered the view of Buyer's Actuary, which gives rise to a
disputed amount not in excess of $1 million (before interest and adjustment as
calculated by Seller's Actuary), such dispute shall be resolved by dividing
the disputed amount in half and adding such amount to the lesser of the two
amounts which originally gave rise to such dispute. If such disputed amount
exceeds $1 million (before interest and adjustment as calculated by Seller's
Actuary) and the Actuaries are not able to resolve such dispute after using
their reasonable best efforts to do so within thirty (30) days from the date
Buyer's Actuary receives the calculation and all related data from the
Seller's Actuary, the Seller and the Buyer shall mutually agree on a third
nationally recognized actuarial firm (the "Independent Actuary"), which has no
professional relationship with either of the parties hereto or either Actuary,
to resolve such dispute. Within thirty (30) days after being engaged to review
the disputed matter in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Independent Actuary shall determine only those matters in
dispute and shall deliver a written report to Seller and Buyer as to the
disputed matters. Upon resolution of the disputed matter, Seller's Actuary
shall recompute the Pension Transfer Amount taking into account the
conclusions of the Independent Actuary as to such disputed matters. The
accuracy of such recomputation shall be subject to confirmation by the Buyer's
Actuary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in rendering its report to the Seller
and Buyer, the Independent Actuary shall not perform independent calculations
but shall be permitted to review the information relied upon by Seller's
Actuary and Buyer's Actuary in their presentations and any follow-up requested
information with respect to the disputed matter. The decision of the
Independent Actuary shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties as to any
dispute for which it was appointed. The cost of the Independent Actuary shall
be divided equally between Seller and Buyer. Each party shall be responsible
for the cost of its own Actuary.

(iii) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, to the extent not filed
prior thereto, Seller and Buyer shall file Form 5310-A with the IRS, if
applicable, with respect to the transfer of assets described in this Section
6.6(i)(iii) and shall make all plan amendments necessary to effectuate such
provision.

  

  

(j) Following the Closing, Buyer shall assume all liabilities of Seller and
the Seller Benefit Plans with respect to other post-employment benefits (as
set forth on Seller Schedule 6.6(j)) of the Business Employees (the "OPEB
Benefits"), and Seller shall bear no liability with respect to the OPEB
Benefits.

  

  

(k) Buyer shall assume responsibility for all claims related to the employment
of the Business Employees (including workers' compensation obligations and
discrimination, payroll and wage and hour claims), regardless of whether such
claim was incurred prior to or after the Closing Date, provided, however, that
Buyer shall only assume responsibility for claims related to the Seller
Benefit Plans to the extent expressly provided in Section 6.6(b), (d), (e),
(f), (g), (h), (i) and (j) herein (including, for the avoidance of doubt, as
provided pursuant to all schedules to such sections) and provided, further,
that Buyer shall not be liable for worker's compensation obligations for
claims incurred during the period from January 1, 2003 until May 31, 2012.

  

  

(l) Seller shall cooperate in good faith with Buyer and provide Buyer with
reasonable access to Seller's employees and books and records to assist Buyer
with meeting its obligations under this Agreement, including information
relating to the day-to-day operation of benefit plans; provided, however, that
any such access shall be provided or conducted during normal business hours
under the supervision of Seller's personnel and in such a manner as to
maintain the confidentiality of the terms of this Agreement and the terms of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case to the extent
such terms have not been publicly disclosed, and not interfere unreasonably
with the business operations of Seller or any of its Affiliates. In addition,
Seller and Buyer shall facilitate the timely, good faith cooperation of the
third parties who provide administrative services with respect to their
employee benefit plans in order to assist the parties in meeting their
obligations under this Agreement; the cooperation of each party's service
providers shall be provided under the supervision of that party.

(m) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and neither any union nor any current or former
employee, nor any other individual associated therewith, is or shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no provision of
this Agreement is intended to, or does, (i) constitute the establishment of,
or an amendment to, any Seller Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of Buyer
or its Affiliates, (ii) alter or limit the ability of Seller to amend, modify
or terminate any Seller Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, (iii) give any third party any right to enforce the
provisions of this Section 6.6, (iv) create, or shall be deemed to create, a
guarantee or promise of continued employment to any individual, or (v) be
deemed to confer upon any such individual or legal representative any rights
under or with respect to any plan, program or arrangement described in or
contemplated by this Agreement, and each such individual or legal
representative shall be entitled to look only to the express terms of any such
plan, program or arrangement for his or her rights thereunder.

  

  

6.7 Non-Solicitation of Employees.

  

  

(a) Except as required by the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreements,
Seller agrees that it will not, and it will cause its Subsidiaries not to, for
the period from the Closing Date until the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, solicit or request any other Person to solicit any Business Employee to
leave employment of Buyer except for general solicitations of employment not
targeted toward employees of Buyer.

  

  

(b) Except for those employees who shall be retained and employed by the
Transferred Companies on and following the Closing Date, Buyer agrees that for
a period from the Closing Date until the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, it will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, solicit or request
any other Person to solicit any employee of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
who provides sales support (either on a partial or exclusive basis) to the
ILEC Services to leave such employment or to accept any other position or
employment with Buyer or its Affiliates except for general solicitations of
employment not targeted toward employees of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

6.8 Confidentiality.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 6.9, which shall govern Privileged Information, for the
period commencing on the Closing and expiring on the third anniversary of the
Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, treat as
confidential and safeguard any and all information, knowledge and data
included as of the Closing in the Transferred Business to the extent it is
related to the Transferred Business or ILEC Services (other than Excluded
Assets) other than information, knowledge or data that becomes publicly
available through no breach by Seller of this Agreement and which is not made
public by Seller prior to Closing ("Buyer Confidential Information").
Thereafter, Seller shall not intentionally disclose any such information,
knowledge or data without Buyer's written consent. Nothing herein shall
restrict Seller's ability to make any disclosures that are required by
applicable Law. For the period commencing on the Closing and expiring on the
third anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall not
use any Customer Proprietary Network Information or Carrier Information to
market any services for use in the Territory to such customer.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 65  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) For the period commencing on the Closing and expiring on the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, treat as confidential and safeguard any and all information, knowledge and
data relating to the businesses of Seller and its Subsidiaries, other than to
the extent it is related to the Transferred Business (other than Excluded
Assets) as of the Closing, that becomes known to Buyer as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents other
than information, knowledge or data that (i) becomes known to Buyer from a
third-party source not known by Buyer to be under an obligation to Seller to
maintain confidentiality; or (ii) becomes publicly available through no breach
by Buyer of this Agreement ("Seller Confidential Information"). Thereafter,
Buyer shall not intentionally disclose any such Seller Confidential
Information without Seller's written consent. Nothing herein shall restrict
Buyer's ability to make any disclosures that are required by applicable Law.
For the period commencing on the Closing and expiring on the third anniversary
of the Closing Date, Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall not use any Seller
Confidential Information for any purpose other than in connection with its
rights and obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents.

  

  

(c) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the confidentiality obligations set
forth herein shall not extend to information, knowledge and data (i) the
disclosure of which is required by applicable Law or reasonably likely to be
required by Law or (ii) that is publicly available or becomes publicly
available through no act or omission of the party owing a duty of
confidentiality, or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than the party owing a duty of confidentiality so long as such
source is not known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement
with or other obligations of secrecy to the other party.

  

  

(d) In the event of a breach of the obligations hereunder by Buyer or Seller,
the other party, in addition to all other available remedies, will be entitled
to seek injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.8 in any
court of competent jurisdiction.

  

  

6.9 Privileged Matters

  

  

(a) Each party hereto acknowledges that: (i) each party and its Affiliates has
or may obtain Privileged Information; (ii) there are and/or may be a number of
Litigation Matters affecting both of Buyer and Seller; (iii) both Buyer and
Seller have a common legal interest in Litigation Matters, in the Privileged
Information and in the preservation of the confidential status of the
Privileged Information, in each case relating to the Transferred Business; and
(iv) both Buyer and Seller intend that the transactions contemplated hereby
and by the Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and any transfer of
Privileged Information in connection therewith shall not operate as a waiver
of any potentially applicable privilege.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 66  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Following the Closing, each of Buyer and Seller agrees, on behalf of
itself and each of its Subsidiaries, not to disclose or otherwise waive any
privilege attaching to any Privileged Information relating to the Transferred
Business without providing prompt written notice to and obtaining the prior
written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed and shall not be withheld, conditioned or
delayed if the other party certifies that such disclosure is to be made in
response to a likely threat of suspension or debarment or similar action;
provided, however, that Buyer shall not be required to give any such notice or
obtain any such consent and may make such disclosure or waiver with respect to
Privileged Information if such Privileged Information relates solely to the
Transferred Business (unless such information relates to matters for which
Seller may have indemnification obligations under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents). In the event of a disagreement concerning the
reasonableness of withholding such consent, no disclosure shall be made prior
to a resolution of such disagreement by a court of competent jurisdiction,
provided that the limitations in this sentence shall not apply in the case of
disclosure required by Law and so certified as provided in the first sentence
of this paragraph.

  

  

 

(c) After the Closing, upon receipt of any subpoena or other compulsory
disclosure notice from a court, other governmental agency or otherwise which
requests disclosure of Privileged Information relating to the Transferred
Business, to the extent permitted by Law, Seller or Buyer (in the case of
information relating to matters for which Seller may have indemnification
obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents, or in the case of
Privileged Information not solely related to the Transferred Business and in
which Seller may have an interest), as applicable shall as promptly as
practicable provide to the other party (following the notice provisions set
forth herein) a copy of such notice, the intended response, and all materials
or information that might be disclosed and the proposed date of disclosure. In
the event of a disagreement as to the intended response or disclosure, unless
and until the disagreement is resolved as provided in paragraph (b) of this
Section, the disclosing party shall, at the other party's expense, cooperate
to the extent such other party seeks to limit such disclosure and take all
reasonable steps to resist or avoid such disclosure, except as otherwise
required by a court order requiring such disclosure.

  

 

  

(d) Nothing in this Section 6.9 shall limit a party's ability to assert its
rights under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents in the event of any
dispute between the parties.

  

  

(e) Buyer shall provide Seller with the cooperation identified on Seller
Schedule 6.9(e).

  

  

6.10 Production of Witnesses. Subject to Section 6.9, after the Closing, each
of Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use
its respective reasonable best efforts to make available to Seller or Buyer,
as the case may be, upon reasonable prior written request, such party's
directors, managers or other persons acting in a similar capacity, officers,
employees and agents as witnesses to the extent that any such Person may
reasonably be required in connection with any Litigation Matters,
administrative or other proceedings in which the requesting party may from
time to time be involved and relating to the Transferred Business, as
applicable. The reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in the
provision of such witnesses shall be paid by the party requesting the
availability of such persons.

6.11 Release by Seller and Its Affiliates. Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, successors, and assigns (all such Persons, together with Seller,
the "Seller Release Parties"), as of the Closing, hereby releases and forever
discharges Buyer, and its Affiliates, successors and assigns (all such Persons
(including the Transferred Companies), together with Buyer, the "Buyer Release
Parties"), from any and all Liabilities which the Buyer Release Parties may
have or may have had, known or unknown, from the beginning of the world until
the Closing, arising out of or against the Transferred Companies, the
Transferred Assets or the ILEC Services; provided that nothing herein
constitutes a release from, waiver of, or otherwise applies to the terms of
this Agreement (including any matters for which Buyer has indemnification
obligations pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement) or any Ancillary
Documents or any enforcement thereof; provided further that, for the avoidance
of doubt, with respect to any Ancillary Document that constitutes an amendment
to an existing agreement, the release herein shall apply to the terms of such
existing agreement and any enforcement thereof for all periods prior to the
Closing. Seller, for itself and the Seller Release Parties, hereby irrevocably
covenants to refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or
demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced or voluntarily
aiding, any proceeding of any kind against any Buyer Release Party, based upon
any matter purported to be released hereby. Seller, for itself and the Seller
Release Parties, shall refrain from bringing any Action for contribution or
indemnification from the Buyer Release Parties (only with respect to the
Transferred Companies or as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), or otherwise commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced
any Action against any Buyer Release Party (only as it relates to the
Transferred Companies or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), for
or in respect of any of the Actions set forth on Buyer Schedule 6.11.

  

  

6.12 Release by Buyer and Its Affiliates. Buyer, on behalf of itself and the
Buyer Release Parties, as of the Closing, hereby releases and forever
discharges all Seller Release Parties from any and all Liabilities which the
Seller Release Parties may have or may have had, known or unknown, from the
beginning of the world until the Closing, arising out of or against the
Transferred Companies, the Transferred Assets or the ILEC Services (other than
Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities); provided that nothing herein
constitutes a release from, waiver of, or otherwise applies to the terms of
this Agreement (including any matters for which Seller has indemnification
obligations pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement) or any Ancillary
Documents or any enforcement thereof; provided further that, for the avoidance
of doubt, with respect to any Ancillary Document that constitutes an amendment
to an existing agreement, the release herein shall apply to the terms of such
existing agreement and any enforcement thereof for all periods prior to the
Closing. Buyer, for itself and the Buyer Release Parties, hereby irrevocably
covenants to refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or
demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced or voluntarily
aiding, any proceeding of any kind against any Seller Release Party, based
upon any matter purported to be released hereby.

6.13 Customer Agreements.

  

  

(a) With respect to Master Agreements, Seller, Buyer and their respective
Subsidiaries will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain prior to the
Closing or, if not obtained, will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain within six (6) months following the Closing Date, from the counterparty
to each Master Agreement any consent that is required to separate the portion
of such Agreement that provides for the delivery of ILEC Services or other
goods or services provided by the Transferred Business (which, for the
avoidance of doubt does not include any goods or services specifically
excluded from the definition of ILEC Services), it being understood that
Seller and Buyer shall not be required to grant any consideration to any
counterparty to such Master Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and
work in good faith to separate the applicable portion of any Master Agreement
hereunder. The Contract constituting the separated portion of any Master
Agreement that provides for the delivery of ILEC Services or other goods or
services provided by the Transferred Business as described in the preceding
sentence shall constitute a "Customer Contract" and "Assigned Contract" under
this Agreement, it being understood that in no event shall those portions of
any Master Agreement providing for the delivery of goods and services that do
not constitute ILEC Services or other goods or services provided by the
Transferred Business be considered a Customer Contract or an Assigned
Contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that no volume, minimum purchase or similar
commitments under Master Agreements or any rights relating thereto will be
transferred to the Transferred Companies as part of the Customer Contracts or
Assigned Contracts or otherwise in whole or in part, except to the extent
solely related to the ILEC Services.

  

  

(b) Buyer shall cause the Transferred Companies to maintain in effect
immediately after Closing the tariffs, price lists, schedules of rates, or
other statements of terms and conditions, including special customer
arrangements, price flex arrangements and individual customer-based
arrangements of Seller and its Subsidiaries for ILEC Services, which are
applicable to the Transferred Business in whole or in part in the Territory
and are in effect immediately prior to the Closing (the "Existing Pricing
Arrangements"). Buyer shall assume the obligations, rights and benefits of
Seller and its Subsidiaries under the Existing Pricing Arrangements (subject
to the last sentence of Section 6.13(a)), including any obligations to
maintain Existing Pricing Arrangements and Customer Contracts through their
terms and optional renewal terms as required by the terms of the Existing
Pricing Arrangements and Customer Contracts and by applicable Law (which for
the avoidance of doubt, shall constitute Assumed Liabilities hereunder solely
to the extent related to the Transferred Business), and including any rights
to terminate or amend Existing Pricing Arrangements and Customer Contracts
through their terms and optional renewal terms as required by the terms of the
Existing Pricing Arrangements and Customer Contracts and by applicable Law.
Buyer and Seller shall work together to make all filings and take all other
actions as may be required by applicable Laws to make the Existing Pricing
Arrangements legally effective no later than the Closing. "Existing Pricing
Arrangement" with respect to ILEC Services covered by Bundled Services
Arrangements shall mean such pricing terms that apply to the ILEC Services
under the terms of the Existing Pricing Arrangements or, in the case that the
terms of the Existing Pricing Arrangements are not dispositive on the point,
are allocated by Seller to the ILEC Services in accordance with the
methodologies that are used in the preparation of Seller's consolidated
financial statements, which methodologies are described on Seller Schedule
6.13(b).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 69  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) With respect to any failure to assign any Customer Contract that would
have been assigned in the Pre-Closing Reorganization as a Transferred Asset
but for the failure to obtain a consent as contemplated by Section 2.4, then
until such consent can be obtained, Seller shall use the Transferred Companies
to provide ILEC Services (or such other goods or services to be provided by
the Transferred Business as described in clause (a) above and the Transferred
Companies shall provide such ILEC Services and such other goods or services)
to such customer (and, subject to Section 6.13(a), promptly provide the
Transferred Companies any payments or other benefits received by Seller or its
Subsidiaries from the customer thereunder in respect of the ILEC Services so
provided), subject to the rights, if any, of such customer under such Contract
to consent thereto, in accordance with the applicable Existing Pricing
Arrangement (which Buyer shall have caused the Transferred Companies to mirror
in accordance with Section 6.13(b)) or the applicable Ancillary Document, in
each case including as to payment terms. The provisions of this Section
6.13(c) shall exclusively govern the circumstances described in the first
sentence hereof, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Within ninety (90) days following the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall
inform Seller whether it intends to assume the portion of the White Pages
Publication and Trademark License Agreement, by and among ATandT Services, Inc.,
ATandT Intellectual Property II, L.P. and YP LLC (the "White Pages Agreement"),
dated as of May 8, 2012 that relates to SNET. If Buyer elects to assume such
portion of the White Pages Agreement, such portion shall constitute an
"Assigned Contract" hereunder. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and work in
good faith to separate the applicable portion of the White Pages Agreement.

  

  

6.14 Insurance. Following the Closing, to the extent that (i) any insurance
policies owned or controlled by any member of Seller Group and provided by a
Person who is not an Affiliate of Seller (collectively, "Seller Insurance
Policies") cover any Assumed Liability or Loss of either of the Transferred
Companies resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating to, occurrences
prior to the Closing and (ii) the Seller Insurance Policies permit claims to
be made thereunder with respect to the Assumed Liabilities or such Losses
resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating to, occurrences prior to
the Closing (the "Company Claims"), at Buyer's cost and expense (including any
increased retrospective premiums and any other reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses related to such Company Claims), Seller shall, and shall cause
the other members of Seller Group to, cooperate with Buyer or its Subsidiaries
in submitting Company Claims (or pursuing Claims previously made) on behalf of
Buyer or such Subsidiary, as applicable, under any Seller Insurance Policy;
provided, however, that Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (A) none of Seller
or any member of Seller Group shall be responsible for any Assumed Liabilities
or Losses that are "self-insured" by Seller or any member of Seller Group as
of immediately prior to the Closing, that are within any applicable deductible
or retention amounts under any Seller Insurance Policy or that are insured by
any captive insurer, (B) none of Seller or any member of Seller Group shall be
liable to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the
Transferred Companies) for any losses or other amounts hereunder if any
insurance company that has issued any Seller Insurance Policy fails to pay
such losses or amounts as a result of, or in connection with, the filing or
declaration of, or institution of proceeding for, any type of bankruptcy
(whether voluntary or involuntary), insolvency or the commencement of any
similar action or proceeding or otherwise, (C) Seller Group may, at any time,
without liability or obligation to Buyer or its Subsidiaries, including, after
the Closing, the Transferred Companies, amend, commute, terminate, buy-out,
extinguish liability under or otherwise modify any Seller Insurance Policy,
provided that Seller Group shall provide Buyer with at least thirty (30) days
written notice of any such action and such action does not adversely affect
Buyer's rights under this Section 6.14 with respect to a pending or potential
covered claim of the Transferred Business and (D) following the Closing, the
Transferred Companies shall continue to be responsible for payment of any
assessments made by any Governmental Entity associated with any Assumed
Liabilities or Losses in respect of any self-insurance obligations under
workers compensation policies and none of Seller or any member of Seller Group
shall be responsible for the payment or reimbursement of any such assessments.
Nothing in this Section 6.14 shall relieve Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) from any obligations
with respect to the Assumed Liabilities or any other Losses. Nothing in this
Section 6.14 affects rights of the Buyer Indemnified Parties to be indemnified
under Section 8.3. This Agreement shall not be construed to waive any right or
remedy of any member of Seller Group in respect of any Seller Insurance
Policy.

6.15 Financing.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and except to the
extent that Buyer has completed an offering of debt securities or another
financing the net cash proceeds of which replace amounts that were to be
provided under the Commitment Letter, Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts (unless, with respect to any action, another standard for performance
is expressly provided for herein) to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms
and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter (taking into account the
anticipated timing of the Marketing Period Termination Date), and Buyer shall
not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision under, the Commitment Letter (or following entry into definitive
documents relating to the Debt Financing, such definitive documents) if such
amendment, modification or waiver (A) with respect to the Commitment Letter or
such definitive documents, as applicable, reduces (or would reasonably be
expected to have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount unless the Debt Financing is increased by a corresponding
amount or the Debt Financing is otherwise made available to fund such fees or
original issue discount) from that contemplated in the Commitment Letter or
such definitive documents, or (B) imposes new or additional conditions or
otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the Debt
Financing, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or
materially delay the Closing or the availability of the Debt Financing on the
Closing Date or (y) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letter, in each of clauses
(x) and (y) in any material respect (provided that, subject to compliance with
the other provisions of this Section 6.15, Buyer may amend the Commitment
Letter or such definitive documents to add additional lenders, arrangers and
agents). Buyer shall promptly deliver to Seller copies of any such amendment,
modification or replacement. For purposes of this Section 6.15, references to
"Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this Section
6.15(a) and references to "Commitment Letter" shall include such document as
permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this Section 6.15(a).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 71  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Except to the extent that Buyer has completed an offering of debt
securities or another financing the net cash proceeds of which replace amounts
that were to be provided under the Commitment Letter, (I) Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts (taking into account the anticipated timing of the
Marketing Period Termination Date) (A) to maintain in effect the Commitment
Letter in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, (B)
to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions
contained in the Commitment Letter (or on such other terms not materially less
favorable to Buyer (or its Subsidiaries), as determined in the reasonable
judgment of Buyer, than the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment
Letter and that do not materially impair the ability of Buyer to fund its
obligations at the Closing Date), (C) to satisfy all conditions to funding in
the Commitment Letter and such definitive agreements with respect thereto that
are within its control and to consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing Date, as applicable, including using its reasonable best efforts to
cause the lenders and the other persons committing to fund the Debt Financing
on the Closing Date (the "Debt Financing Sources"), (D) to enforce its rights
under the Commitment Letter and any definitive agreements with respect
thereto, and (E) to comply with its obligations under the Commitment Letter,
(II) Buyer shall use best efforts to enter into the Bridge Facilities
Documentation with the lenders thereto no later than January 30, 2014, and
(III) Buyer shall not use the financing contemplated by the Bridge Facilities
Documentation or the Debt Financing other than to fund the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and related expenses. Buyer shall keep Seller
reasonably informed of the status of Buyer's efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing and shall provide to Seller copies of the executed material
definitive agreements for the Debt Financing.

  

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall give Seller
prompt notice (x) of any breach or default by any party to the Commitment
Letter or definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing of which Buyer
has Knowledge, (y) of the receipt of any notice or other communication, in
each case from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any actual or
potential material breach, material default, termination or repudiation by any
party to the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements relating to the Debt
Financing of any provisions of the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements
relating to the Debt Financing and (z) if at any time for any reason Buyer
believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the Debt
Financing Sources contemplated by the Commitment Letter or definitive
agreements relating to the Debt Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the date Seller delivers to Buyer a written request, Buyer shall provide
any information reasonably requested by Seller relating to any circumstance
referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately preceding sentence.
Upon the occurrence of any circumstance referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z)
of the second preceding sentence resulting in any portion of the Debt
Financing becoming unavailable, or if any portion of the Debt Financing
otherwise becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions) contemplated in the Commitment Letter and related fee letter, and
such portion is reasonably required to effect the Closing, Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof
alternative financing ("Alternative Debt Financing") from alternative sources
in an amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or such unavailable portion
thereof, as the case may be, with terms and conditions not materially less
favorable to Buyer (or its Subsidiaries), as determined in the reasonable
judgment of Buyer, than the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment
Letter and any related fee letter (including the flex provisions therein) and
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event.
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the reasonable best efforts
obligation set forth in this Section 6.15 be construed so as to require Buyer
to agree to, or accept, economic terms that are materially less favorable to
Buyer than the economic terms contained in the Commitment Letter and any
related fee letter (assuming the application of the "market flex" provisions).
Buyer shall deliver to Seller true and complete copies of all written
agreements, arrangements or contracts (including any side letters or (subject
to customary redactions) fee letters) pursuant to which any such alternative
source shall have committed to provide any Alternative Debt Financing.

Article IX and the completion of the Financing, Seller shall, and Seller shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and each of its and their representatives to,
use its respective reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation that is
necessary, customary or advisable and reasonably requested by Buyer to assist
Buyer in the arrangement of the Debt Financing or any public or private
offering of debt securities undertaken in replacement of all or a portion of
the Debt Financing (the "Bond Financing" and, together with the Debt
Financing, the "Financing") for the purposes of financing the Purchase Price
and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and all related fees and expenses of
Buyer (it being acknowledged and agreed by Buyer that the receipt of such
Financing is not a condition to the Closing), including (A) participating in a
reasonable number of meetings, rating agency sessions and drafting sessions,
and participating in reasonable and customary due diligence, (B) furnishing
Buyer and the financial institutions providing or arranging the Debt Financing
and the Bond Financing (the "Financing Sources") with the Required Financial
Information, (C) assisting Buyer and the Financing Sources in the preparation
of (1) offering documents for the Debt Financing and the Bond Financing and

to execute and deliver customary definitive financing documents to the extent
reasonably requested by Buyer and otherwise facilitating the pledging of
collateral reasonably necessary to secure the Debt Financing or the Bond
Financing; provided that the effectiveness of any definitive documentation
executed by the Transferred Companies shall be subject to the occurrence of
the Closing and (G) furnishing Buyer and any Financing Sources promptly, and
in any event at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, with
all documentation and other information required by any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Debt Financing and the Bond Financing under applicable
"know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,

conduct of the business or operations of Seller or its Subsidiaries, (B)
require Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other
similar fee or incur any other cost or expense that is not reimbursed by Buyer
or otherwise incur any liability or give any indemnities, in connection with
the Debt Financing; provided, however, that Seller shall be responsible for
such fees, costs and expenses incurred by Seller in connection with preparing
and delivering any of the Financial Statements provided for in Section 6.18,
(C) require Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action that would
reasonably be expected to conflict with, or result in any violation or breach
of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other comparable organizational
documents of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, any applicable Laws or any
Contract. In addition, nothing herein shall require Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its Representatives to deliver legal opinions. In
furtherance of and without limitation to the second immediately preceding
sentence, nothing herein shall require Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to,
enter into any agreement (or require their respective boards of directors or
equivalent governing bodies to approve any such agreement) in connection with
the Financing. Except for the fees, costs and expenses incurred by Seller in
connection with preparing and delivering any of the Financial Statements
provided for in Section 6.18, Buyer shall promptly, upon request by Seller,
reimburse Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third party
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective representatives in connection
with the Financing and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its
Subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and against any and all
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information used
in connection therewith (other than arising from (x) fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, misstatements or omissions on the part of Seller or its
Affiliates or (y) written historical information of the type prepared by
Seller or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business that is provided
by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of the Financing).

prior to the Closing Date (as estimated by the parties in good faith) the
parties shall mutually agree on the additional services and tasks to be

foregoing (collectively, the "Seller Trademarks"), or (B) any other
Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (the foregoing, together with the Seller Trademarks, the "Seller

interest it has in or to any of the Seller IP, including any Seller
Trademarks, and transfer any and all tangible embodiments thereof, to Seller
or a designee specified by a Seller at or prior to the Closing; provided, that

Closing, have any rights in or to the Seller Trademarks and (ii) neither Buyer
nor any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Transferred
Companies) shall contest the ownership or validity of any rights of Seller or
its Subsidiaries in or to the Seller Trademarks that exist as of the Closing.

  

  

(c) Except as expressly provided in this Section 6.21 or otherwise in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document, it is expressly agreed that, after the
Closing, no member of Seller Group will have any right, title or interest
(whether express or implied) in, to or under the Trademarks listed in Seller
Schedule 6.21(c) (collectively, the "Company Trademarks"). Prior to the
Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the
Transferred Companies), to take commercially reasonable actions that are
necessary or advisable, including the payment of fees or the filing of
documents, for the purposes of obtaining, maintaining, or renewing any rights
in the Transferred Trademarks.

  

  

(d) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that on or before the Closing, Seller or its
designee will transfer and migrate to any devices or media at a location or

any refund, or (B) utilize the benefit of any overpayment or prepayment of USF
contributions which relate to amounts paid by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Companies prior to Closing), Buyer
shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, to Seller the entire
amount of the refund or overpayment (including interest) received or utilized
by Buyer or its Affiliates, net of any Taxes or other costs incurred by Buyer
or its Affiliates attributable to the receipt of such refund. Buyer agrees to
notify Seller promptly of both the discovery of a right to claim any such
refund or overpayment and the receipt of any such refund or utilization of any
such overpayment. Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to claim
any such refund or to utilize any such overpayment as soon as possible and to
furnish to Seller all information, records and assistance necessary to verify
the amount of the refund or overpayment, provided, that Buyer shall be
permitted to use its own Tax attributes prior to utilizing such overpayment
described in this Section 6.22.

6.23 Restriction on Disclosure of Confidential Information to Certain Third
Parties. From the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing
Date or the termination of this Agreement, Seller and its Affiliates shall not
(and shall cause their Representatives not to) furnish non-public information
regarding the Transferred Business to any Person that has made a proposal or
expression of interest, whether orally or in writing, to Seller or its
Subsidiaries relating to the acquisition of all or any substantial portion of
the Transferred Business in connection with such proposal; provided, however,

(b) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of
Buyer set forth in Section 5.1 (Organization and Qualification), Section 5.2
(Corporate Authority), Section 5.5 (Binding Effect) and Section 5.7 (Finder's
Fee) shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing as if made on and as of the Closing (except
for such representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date
which shall speak only as of such date, in which case such representation and
warranty shall be so true and correct as of such earlier date). The
representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in Article V (other than
Section 5.1 (Organization and Qualification), Section 5.2 (Corporate
Authority), Section 5.5 (Binding Effect) and Section 5.7 (Finder's Fee)) shall
be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing as
though made as of such date and time (except to the extent that any such
representation expressly speaks as of an earlier date, and in each case
disregarding any materiality qualifications contained therein) except in the
case of this sentence where such failure would not reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially impair or delay Buyer's or its Subsidiaries ability to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents.

  

  

(c) Covenants. The covenants and agreements of Buyer to be performed on or
prior to the Closing shall have been duly performed in all material respects.

  

  

(d) Certificate. Seller shall have received a certificate, signed by a duly
authorized officer of Buyer and dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.3(b) and 7.3(c) have been satisfied.

  

  

ARTICLE VIII

  

  

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION; CERTAIN REMEDIES

  

  

8.1 Survival. The representations and warranties of Seller and Buyer contained
in this Agreement and all claims with respect thereto shall survive the
Closing for the periods set forth in this Section 8.1. All representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement and all claims with respect thereto
shall terminate upon the expiration of eighteen (18) months after the Closing
Date, except that the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.1
(Organization and Qualification), Section 4.2 (Capital Structure), Section 4.3
(Corporate Authorization), Section 4.6 (Binding Effect), Section 4.21
(Finders' Fees), Section 5.1 (Organization and Qualification), Section 5.2
(Corporate Authorization) and Section 5.5 (Binding Effect) shall survive
indefinitely, the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.10
(Employees and Employee Benefits) and Section 4.13 (Environmental Matters)
shall terminate upon the expiration of three (3) years after the Closing Date,
and the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.9 (Taxes) and
the related indemnification obligations contained in Section 6.5 (Tax Matters)
shall survive as provided for in Section 6.5. Any claim for breach of
representation or warranty must be delivered prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival term set forth in this Section 8.1. It is the intention of
the parties that the survival periods and termination dates set forth in this
Section 8.1 supersede any statute of limitation applicable to such
representations and warranties or claims with respect thereto. Any covenants
contained in this Agreement shall survive in accordance with their terms and
any claim for Losses in respect of a breach of a covenant for which this
Agreement contemplated performance prior to Closing must be delivered within
18 months of the Closing.

8.2 Indemnification by Buyer. Buyer agrees that from and after the Closing
Date it shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, each of its
Subsidiaries, and their respective directors, officers, shareholders,
partners, members, attorneys, accountants, agents, representatives and
employees and their heirs, successors and permitted assigns, each in their
capacity as such (the "Seller Indemnified Parties") from, against and in
respect of any claims, damages, losses, charges, Liabilities, actions, suits,
proceedings, judgments, settlements, assessments, Taxes, interest, penalties,
and reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) (collectively, "Losses") actually incurred or suffered by any of the
Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of or resulting from, (i) any breach of
any representation or warranty made by Buyer in Article V of this Agreement
(including as if such representations and warranties were made as of the
Closing (except for such representations and warranties that are made as of a
specific date)) for the period such representation or warranty survives, (ii)
except to the extent that the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to be
indemnified in respect thereof (without giving effect to the limitations
contained in Section 8.1 or 8.3(b)), any of the Assumed Liabilities, (iii) any
breach of a covenant or agreement of Buyer or any of its Affiliates contained
in this Agreement and (iv) except to the extent that the Buyer Indemnified
Parties are entitled to be indemnified in respect thereof (without giving
effect to the limitations contained in Section 8.1 or 8.3(b)), any Liabilities
that Buyer has expressly agreed to assume pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

8.3 Indemnification by Seller.

  

  

(a) Seller hereby agrees that from and after the Closing it shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates, and their respective
directors, officers, shareholders, partners, members, attorneys, accountants,
agents, representatives and employees (other than the Business Employees) and
their heirs, successors and permitted assigns, each in their capacity as such
(the "Buyer Indemnified Parties" and, collectively with the Seller Indemnified
Parties, the "Indemnified Parties") from, against and in respect of any Losses
actually incurred or suffered by, any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties arising
out of or resulting from (i) subject to Section 8.3(b), any breach of any
representation or warranty made by Seller in Article IV of this Agreement
(including as if such representations and warranties were made as of the
Closing (except for such representations and warranties that are made as of a
specific date)) for the period such representation or warranty survives, (ii)
any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement,
(iii) any of the Excluded Liabilities, and (iv) all USF contributions that
relate to the provision of ILEC Services prior to the Closing.

  

  

(b) Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any Losses
with respect to the matters contained in Section 8.3(a)(i) unless the Losses
therefrom exceed an aggregate amount equal to $30,000,000 (the "Indemnity
Threshold") and then only for Losses in excess of that amount and up to an
aggregate amount equal to $200,000,000 (the "Indemnity Cap"), provided,
however, that any Losses up to an aggregate amount equal to $100,000,000
arising from any breach of any of the representations and warranties in
Section 4.17 (Assets) shall not be counted towards the Indemnity Cap (it being
understood that Seller's maximum aggregate liability for Losses in respect of
breaches of the representations and warranties in Section 4.17 (Assets) shall
be $300,000,000, less any other Losses under other representations and
warranties for which Seller is liable and are applied to the Indemnity Cap).
Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of any
individual claim or series of claims arising out of a similar occurrence or
set of facts for indemnification under Section 8.3(a)(i) involving Losses of
less than $75,000; provided, however, Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties in respect of any individual claim for indemnification of
any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in the first
sentence of Section 4.17 involving Losses of less than $25,000.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this Section
8.3(b) shall not apply to any claims for Losses resulting from or arising out
of breaches of the representations and warranties in Section 4.2 (Capital
Structure), Section 4.3 (Corporate Authorization), Section 4.6 (Binding
Effect) and Section 4.21 (Finders' Fees), or due to fraud by or on behalf of
the Seller.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 83  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) For purposes of this Article VIII, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to any
materiality, Seller Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification
contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty,
provided that (A) such "material" and "Seller Material Adverse Effect"
qualifiers shall not be disregarded in Section 4.7(c) (Financial Statements),
Section 4.8 (Litigation and Claims), Section 4.10(i) (Employees and Employee
Benefits), Section 4.15(a) (Contracts), Section 4.16 (Absence of Changes), the
second sentence of Section 4.17 (Assets), the first sentence of Section 4.18
(Communications Licenses) or Section 4.19(b) (Title to Property), and (B) the
word "material" shall not be disregarded where it immediately precedes (1) the
term "Seller Benefit Plans" in Section 4.10 (Employees and Employee Benefit
Plans) and (2) the term "Governmental Authorizations" in Section 4.12
(Compliance with Laws; Communications Authorizations). The rights of an
Indemnified Party to indemnification under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Documents shall not be affected by any investigation conducted or actual or
constructive knowledge acquired at any time by such Indemnified Party, whether
before or after the date of this Agreement or any Closing Date.

  

  

8.4 Third-Party Claim Indemnification Procedures.

  

  

(a) In the event that any claim or demand for which an indemnifying party (an
"Indemnifying Party") may have liability to any Indemnified Party hereunder is
asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a
third party (other than a claim by a Taxing authority for Taxes) (a "Third-
Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event more
than thirty (30) days following such Indemnified Party's receipt of a Third-
Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third-Party
Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder (which
estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Third-Party
Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints
relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other material details
pertaining thereto (a "Claim Notice"); provided, however, that the failure
timely to give a Claim Notice shall affect the rights of an Indemnified Party
hereunder only to the extent that such failure has an adverse effect on the
resolution of the Third-Party Claim or on the defenses or other rights
available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third-Party Claim.
The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim
Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party that it desires
to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 84  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the
sole power to direct and control such defense. All costs and expenses incurred
by the Indemnifying Party in defending such action shall be counted in
calculating the amounts set forth in Section 8.3(b) if the Third-Party Claim
relates to a matter to which Section 8.3(b) applies. Once the Indemnifying
Party has duly assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such
defense. If the Indemnified Party shall participate in any such defense, it
shall participate at its sole cost and expense unless (i) the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party are both named parties to the proceedings and
the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that representation of
both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate, due to a non-waivable
conflict, or (ii) the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party
Claim after the Indemnifying Party has failed to diligently pursue a Third-
Party Claim it has assumed, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel (in
addition to any necessary local counsel) to the extent such Third-Party Claim
is subject to indemnification or reimbursement under Section 8.2 or Section
8.3. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any
Third-Party Claim on a basis that would result in (i) the imposition of a
consent order, injunction or decree that would restrict the future activity or
conduct of the Indemnified Party, (ii) a finding or admission of a violation
of Law or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party,
(iii) a finding or admission that would have an adverse effect on other claims
made or threatened against the Indemnified Party, or (iv) except to the extent
within the amounts set forth in Section 8.3(b) if applicable, any monetary
liability of the Indemnified Party that will not be paid or reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party.

  

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third-Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party
timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise, (ii) is not entitled to
defend the Third-Party Claim as a result of the Indemnified Party's election
to defend the Third-Party Claim as provided in Section 8.4(b) hereof, or (iii)
after assuming the defense of a Third-Party Claim, fails to take reasonable
steps necessary to defend diligently such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right but not the obligation to provide its own defense
and shall consult with the Indemnifying Party regarding the strategy for
defense of such claim, including with respect to the Indemnified Party's
choice of legal counsel; it being understood that the Indemnified Party's
right to indemnification for a Third-Party Claim shall not be adversely
affected by whether it assumes the defense of such Third-Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall have no liability with respect to a Third-Party Claim
settled without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed,
conditioned or withheld.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 85  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim, including by
providing access to each other's relevant business records and other
documents, and employees (including, if necessary, availability for
depositions and testifying); it being understood that the reasonable costs and
expenses of the Indemnified Party relating thereto shall be considered Losses.
The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall keep each other fully
informed with respect to the status of such Third-Party Claim.

  

  

(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent
with applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel
and others representing any party to a Third-Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges (if
applicable).

  

  

(f) Each of Buyer and Seller hereby consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction
of any court in which a Third-Party Claim is brought for purposes of any claim
for indemnification or reimbursement with respect to such Third-Party Claim or
the matters alleged therein.

  

  

8.5 Consequential Damages.

  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
Person shall be liable under this Article VIII for any consequential,
punitive, special or exemplary damages, regardless of the form of action,
whether in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, and whether or not
such damages were foreseen or unforeseen, except to the extent awarded by a
court of competent jurisdiction in connection with a Third-Party Claim;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall limit an Indemnified Party's
ability to recover lost profits or diminution in value.

  

  

8.6 Adjustments to Losses.

  

  

(a) Insurance. In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under any insurance
policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against
any other Person, net of any actual costs, expenses or premiums incurred in
connection with securing or obtaining such proceeds, shall be deducted, except
to the extent that the adjustment itself would excuse, exclude or limit the
coverage of all or part of such Loss. In the event that an Indemnified Party
has any rights against a third party with respect to any occurrence, claim or
loss that results in a payment by an Indemnifying Party under this Article
VIII, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to such rights to the extent
of such payment; provided that until the Indemnified Party recovers full
payment of the Loss, any and all claims of the Indemnifying Party against any
such third party on account of said indemnity payment is hereby expressly made
subordinate and subject in right of payment to the Indemnified Party's rights
against such third party. Without limiting the generality or effect of any
other provision hereof, each Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party shall
duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and
perfect the subrogation and subordination rights detailed herein, and
otherwise cooperate in the prosecution of such claims.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 86  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Reimbursements and Adjustments. In calculating the amount of any Loss for
which either party is entitled to indemnification hereunder, to the extent
such Loss is otherwise recovered by a party pursuant to other terms of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document, such amount actually recovered shall be
deducted from the amount owed for such Loss, so that the same amount shall not
be paid more than once.

  

  

(c) Taxes. Nothing herein shall prevent an Indemnifying Party from asserting
that the amount of Loss incurred by an Indemnified Party for which
indemnification is sought hereunder may take into account any net Tax benefit
actually realized by such Indemnified Party as a result of incurring such
Loss; it being understood that any such assertion shall not be dispositive in
determining the amount of such Loss.

  

  

(d) Reimbursement. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third
party in respect of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder
after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to
the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (A) the amount paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus the amount received from the
third party in respect thereof (net of any actual costs or expenses incurred
in connection with obtaining such amount), less (B) the full amount of the
Loss.

  

  

8.7 Payments

  

  

(a) . The Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts payable pursuant to this
Article VIII promptly following receipt from an Indemnified Party of a claim
for a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder, unless and for so
long as the Indemnifying Party in good faith disputes the Loss in which event
it shall so notify the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party agrees to
provide reasonable supplementary documentation for all claims they make under
this Article VIII. In any event, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the
Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount
of any Loss for which it is liable hereunder no later than three (3) Business
Days following any Final Determination of such Loss and the Indemnifying
Party's liability therefor.

  

  

8.8 Characterization of Indemnification Payments. Except as otherwise required
by Law, all payments made by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party in
respect of any claim pursuant to Section 8.2 or 8.3 hereof shall be treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

  

  

8.9 Mitigation. Nothing herein shall prevent an Indemnifying Party from
asserting that the amount of such Loss incurred by an Indemnified Party for
which indemnification is sought hereunder may take into account the
Indemnified Party's failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
such Loss; it being understood that any such assertion shall not be
dispositive in determining the amount of such Loss.

  

  

8.10 Remedies. Except as otherwise expressly specified in this Agreement, the
rights and remedies of Seller and Buyer under this Article VIII are exclusive
following the Closing and in lieu of any and all other rights and remedies
which Seller and Buyer may have under this Agreement or otherwise for monetary
relief with respect to the subject matter hereof. The parties covenant not to
sue, assert any arbitration claim or otherwise threaten any claim other than
those described in this Article VIII as being available under the particular
circumstances described in this Article VIII.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Page 87  

  

 

 

 

  

8.11 Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge and agree that any breach
of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for which monetary
damages would not be an adequate remedy. The parties accordingly agree that,
in addition to any other rights or remedies it may have at law or in equity,
the other party shall be entitled to (x) enforce the terms of this Agreement
by decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of monetary damages as a remedy and (y) seek injunctive relief
against any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. Neither party will
contest an action by the other party for injunctive relief or an order of
specific performance on the basis that there is an adequate remedy at law, or
that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason, at law or in equity. The parties agree to not seek and agree to waive
any requirement for the securing or posting of a bond in connection with a
party seeking or obtaining any relief pursuant to this Section 8.11.

  

  

ARTICLE IX

  

  

TERMINATION

  

  

9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

  

  

(a) by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller;

  

  

(b) by either Buyer or Seller, by giving written notice of such termination to
the other party, if the Closing shall not have occurred by December 16, 2014
(as extended pursuant to this Section 9.1, the "Termination Date"); provided,
however, that in the event that, as of such date, the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1(a), Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.3(a) have not been satisfied or
waived, the Termination Date may be extended from time to time by either Buyer
or Seller one or more times to a date not beyond June 16, 2015;

  

  

(c) by either Buyer or Seller, by giving written notice of such termination to
the other party, if any Order prohibiting the Closing shall become final and
non-appealable;

  

  

(d) by Buyer if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by Seller in this Agreement, or any such
representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this
Agreement, such that Section 7.2(c) or (e) would not be satisfied and such
breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within the
earlier of (i) sixty (60) days after written notice thereof is given by Buyer
to Seller and (ii) the Termination Date; or

  

  

(e) by Seller if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement, or any such
representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this
Agreement, such that Section 7.3(b) or (c) would not be satisfied and such
breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within the
earlier of (i) sixty (60) days after written notice thereof is given by Seller
to Buyer and (ii) the Termination Date.

9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Section 9.1, this Agreement shall thereafter become void
and have no further effect, and no party hereto shall have any liability to
the other party hereto or their respective Affiliates, directors, officers or
employees, except for the obligations of the parties hereto contained in this
Section 9.2 and in the last sentence of Section 6.1 (Access and Information),
and in Sections 10.1 (Notices), Section 10.2 (Amendment; Waiver), Section 10.3
(No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties), Section 10.4 (Entire Agreement),

10.17 (No Recourse) hereof (and any related definitional provisions set forth
in Article I), and except that nothing in this Section 9.2 shall relieve any
party from liability for any willful or material breach of this Agreement that
arose prior to such termination.

10.2 Amendment; Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived if such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by the parties hereto, or in the case of a waiver, by the party
against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 10.2,
Section 10.3, Section 9.2, Section 10.11 and Section 10.16, to the extent
affecting any of the Financing Sources, may not be amended, modified, waived
or supplemented (including any defined term used therein) in a manner adverse
to any of the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of each
Financing Source.

  

  

10.3 No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties.

  

  

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors, legal representatives and
permitted assigns. Subject to the provisions of Sections 2.4 and 6.13, no
party to this Agreement may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its
duties or obligations under this Agreement, by operation of Law or otherwise,
without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, and (ii) Buyer
may, by written notice, assign any and all of its rights under this Agreement
(A) to one or more of its wholly owned subsidiaries (but no such assignment
shall relieve Buyer of any of its duties or obligations hereunder) or (B) to
the Financing Sources for collateral security purposes. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other
than Buyer, Seller, the Indemnified Parties and their respective successors,
legal representatives and permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or
by reason of this Agreement, except for the rights of the Financing Sources
pursuant to this Section 10.3, Section 10.2, Section 9.2, Section 10.10 and
Section 10.17.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall not convey, transfer or lease its
properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, unless the
Person which acquires by conveyance or transfer, or which leases, the
properties and assets of Buyer substantially as an entirety shall expressly
assume, by an instrument in writing, executed and delivered to Seller, in form
reasonably satisfactory to Seller, the due and punctual payment of any amounts
due from Buyer at or prior to the Closing hereunder and the performance or
observance of every covenant of this Agreement on the part of Buyer to be
performed or observed at or prior to the Closing.

  

  

10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Confidentiality
Agreement, and all Disclosure Schedules, Annexes and Exhibits hereto) and the
Ancillary Documents contain the entire agreement between the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters, except for
the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect
until the Closing.

  

  

10.5 Fulfillment of Obligations. Any obligation of any party to any other
party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or
fulfilled completely by an Affiliate of such party, shall be deemed to have
been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

  

  

10.6 Public Disclosure. Each party hereto shall obtain consent of the other
party (such consent to be not unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld),
prior to issuing any press releases regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, except as required by Law or by any
Governmental Entity and except to the extent that the text of such release is
substantially similar to text that has previously been publicly disclosed by
Seller or Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or is
substantially similar to any mutually agreed upon communication plan. In the
case of any such press release to be made as required by Law or by any such
Governmental Entity, the party proposing to make such disclosure shall provide
the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
reference to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, prior to
issuing or making any such press release (and such disclosing party shall
review and consider any such comments in good faith). To the extent
practicable, each party shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any other
public announcements or public disclosures (other than press releases) with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any Ancillary
Documents to be consistent with the parties' prior disclosures and any
mutually agreed upon communication plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer
may, in connection with the Financing, disclose information concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents of the
type typically included in a public debt offering on Form S-3 where the
proceeds are to be used by an operating company in the telecommunications
industry to finance an acquisition, including pro forma financial information
and a summary of the transaction, this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents,
after providing Seller a reasonable opportunity to review such disclosure and
acting in good faith to take into account the reasonable comments of Seller;
provided, however, that Buyer will not disclose any information that is
competitively sensitive to Seller, without obtaining Seller\'s prior written
consent. To the extent a party is obligated to file this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document publicly with any Governmental Entity, such party shall
give the non-disclosing party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
(and shall in good faith take into account the comments of such party) on the
scope of any redactions and requests for confidential treatment of the terms
hereof.

Ancillary Documents, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents are consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be borne by the party
incurring such expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents, whether or
not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents are consummated, any fees or expenses incurred by any of Seller, its
Subsidiaries of the Transferred Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates (including the fees and expenses of legal counsel, any accountant,
auditor, broker, financial advisor or consultant retained by them or on their
behalf) in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be the responsibility
of, and paid by, the Seller.

  

  

10.8 Bulk Sales. Seller and Buyer (on behalf of themselves and their
Subsidiaries) agree to waive compliance with Article 6 of the Uniform
Commercial Code and other bulk sales Laws as adopted in each of the
jurisdictions in which any of the Transferred Assets are located to the extent
that such Article is applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents.

Documents, the Receiving Party shall hold such funds in trust for, and
immediately pay over such funds to, the Entitlement Party.

that constitutes a Transferred Asset should have been transferred to the

consideration by Buyer or the Transferred Companies, to the applicable

assumption.

following the Closing Date.

proceeding and for the taking of all such acts as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to confer jurisdiction over it before the Chosen Courts

HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCES). The
provisions of this Section 10.11 shall inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, each Financing Source, each of which is hereby intended to be

and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of
this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance,
is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision
and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision
to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
