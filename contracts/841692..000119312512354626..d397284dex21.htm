(b) Merger Sub, or Parent on behalf of Merger Sub, expressly reserves the
right to waive, in its sole discretion, in whole or in part, any of the Offer

the commencement of the Offer (such time, or such subsequent time to which the
expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with this Agreement, the "
_Expiration Date_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, Merger Sub
may, without the consent of the Company, (i) extend the Offer for one or more
periods of time of up to 20 Business Days per extension (the length of any
such extension to be determined by Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) in

Condition has not been satisfied (and, to the extent permitted, shall not have
been waived by Parent) or (ii) elect to provide a Subsequent Offering Period.

Company on one or more occasions for periods of up to 20 Business Days per
extension (the length of any such extension to be determined by Merger Sub
(or Parent on its behalf) in its sole discretion) up to and including the
Outside Date, if at any then-scheduled Expiration Date any of the Offer
Conditions have not been satisfied or waived. In addition, Merger Sub, or
Parent on behalf of Merger Sub, shall extend the Offer for any period or
periods if required by any Law, rule, regulation, interpretation or position
of the SEC or the staff thereof or the NASDAQ Global Market (" _NASDAQ_ ")

may, in its sole discretion, provide a subsequent offering period or one or
more extensions thereof (a " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") in accordance
with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act if, as of the commencement of
such period, there shall not have been validly tendered (without regard to
Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet
been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee), and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, that number of Shares necessary to
permit the Merger to be effected without a meeting of shareholders of the
Company in accordance with Section 302A.621 of the MBCA. The Offer Documents
shall provide for the possibility of a "subsequent offering period".

(g) Subject to the foregoing, including the requirements of Rule 14d-11 of

otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of Shares such amounts

such payment under the Code or any other applicable Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Merger Sub, such amounts shall be (a) paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Authority and (b) treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Merger Sub.

Stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization,
combination, exchange of shares, merger, consolidation, reorganization or the
like occurring or having a record date on or after the date of this Agreement

Section 2.01(i) shall be construed as permitting the Company to take any such
action or to enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited by
this Agreement.

Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if this

have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Merger
Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so
corrected or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents,

stock depositories, in each case as of the most recent practicable date, and
shall provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists
(and, if available, computer files) of shareholders, non-objecting beneficial
holders, mailing labels and securities positions) and such assistance as
Parent or its agents may reasonably request in connection with the Offer. In
addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company shall, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any third parties to, cooperate with
Parent and its agents to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares
held in or subject to any Company Equity Plan or other Plan, and to
permit such holders of Shares to tender Shares in the Offer. Except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and other documents
necessary to consummate the Transactions or as otherwise necessary in
furtherance of effecting the Transactions, Parent shall hold in confidence
the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use
such information only in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions.

 

(c) Concurrently with the filing of the Schedule TO with the SEC on the day
that the Offer is commenced, the Company shall file with the SEC and
disseminate to holders of Shares with the Offer Documents a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto and including any
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall reflect the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and, subject to the terms of this Agreement, the
Company Board Recommendation

 



\- 16 -   and shall include a description of the other Board Actions. The Company
shall also include in the Schedule 14D-9, and represents that it has obtained
all necessary consents of the Company Financial Advisor to permit the Company
to include in the Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, the fairness opinion
described in Section 4.26, together with a summary thereof and of the
underlying financial analysis. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as, and to the extent,
required by applicable Law. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is
filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent, Merger Sub or
their counsel. The Company shall promptly provide Parent, Merger Sub and
their counsel with copies of any written comments and shall inform them of any
oral comments that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly
after receipt of those comments. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review any written responses to such SEC
comments, and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and
their counsel.

(d) The Company shall promptly file with the Commissioner of Commerce of the
State of Minnesota all materials of the Company referred to in Section 80B.04
of the Minnesota Statutes.

Section 2.03 _Company Board and Company Board Committees_.

(a)  _Composition of the Company Board and Board Committees_. Effective upon
the initial acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of Shares pursuant to the
Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ ", the use of which term herein shall not,
unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether Parent shall
exercise its rights under this Section 2.03(a)), and from time to time
thereafter up to the Effective Time, subject to payment for such Shares and
subject to Section 2.03(b), Parent shall be entitled to designate up to such
number of directors on the Company Board equal to the product (rounded up to
the next whole number) obtained by multiplying (i) the number of directors on
the Company Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of directors
pursuant to this Section 2.03(a)) and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of Shares held by Parent and Merger Sub (giving effect to the
Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer), and the denominator of which is the
total number of then outstanding Shares. Promptly following a request by
Parent, the Company shall cause the individuals so designated by Parent to be
elected or appointed to the Company Board, including either by increasing the
size of the Company Board or by seeking and accepting or otherwise securing
the resignations of such number of then incumbent directors as is necessary to
enable the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed
to the Company Board (the date on which the majority of the Companys
directors are designees of Parent that have been effectively elected or
appointed to the Company Board in accordance herewith, the " _Director
Appointment Date_ "). From time to time after the Acceptance Time, subject to
payment for such Shares and subject to Section 2.03(b), the Company shall take
all action necessary to cause the individuals so designated by Parent to
constitute substantially the same percentage (rounding up

 



\- 17 -   where appropriate) as is on the Company Board on each committee of the
Company Board to the fullest extent permitted by all applicable Laws,
including the rules of NASDAQ. Solely for the purposes of this Section 2.03,
any and all members of the Company Board immediately prior to such
appointments by Parent who remain on the Company Board after such appointment
by Parent shall be referred to as " _Continuing Directors_ ". Upon the
consummation of the Offer, the Company shall accept such number of
resignations as will be necessary to effectuate the exercise of Parents
rights under this Section 2.03(a), subject to Section 2.03(b). Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company Board shall have at least two Continuing
Directors. If the number of directors who are Continuing Directors is reduced
below two prior to the Effective Time, the remaining Continuing Director shall
be entitled to designate an individual to fill such vacancy who is not a
current or former officer, director, employee or consultant of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (a " _Parent Insider_ ") and who shall be deemed a
Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement, and the Company shall
cause such designee to be appointed to the Company Board. If, notwithstanding
compliance with the foregoing provisions, the number of Continuing Directors
is reduced to zero, then the other directors on the Company Board shall
designate and appoint to the Company Board two directors who are not Parent
Insiders who shall be deemed Continuing Directors for all purposes of this
Agreement.

 

(b) _Continued Listing_. In the event that Parents designees are elected or
appointed to the Company Board pursuant to Section 2.03(a), and without
limiting Section 2.03(a), until the Effective Time, the Company Board shall
have at least such number of directors as may be required by the rules of
NASDAQ or the federal securities Laws who are considered independent
directors within the meaning of such Laws (" _Independent Directors_ ");
_provided, however,_ that after the Acceptance Time, subject to payment by
Merger Sub for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, the Company shall, upon
Parents request, take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a
"controlled company" for purposes of Listing Rule 5615(c) of NASDAQ (or any
successor provision) and make all necessary filings and
disclosures associated with such status; _provided, further,_ that in the
event the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below the number of
directors as may be required by such Laws for any reason whatsoever, the
remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to designate persons to
fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for
purposes of this Agreement or, if no other Independent Director then remains,
the other directors shall designate such number of directors as may be
required by the rules of NASDAQ or the federal securities Laws to fill such
vacancies who shall not be shareholders or Affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub,
and such Persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of
this Agreement.

(c) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligation to
appoint Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to Section 2.03(a)
shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all action required
pursuant to this Section 2.03 and Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this
Section 2.03, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with
respect to the Company and its directors and officers as is required under
such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under
this Section 2.03. Parent shall, reasonably promptly after the date hereof,
provide to the Company in writing, and be responsible for any information
with respect to itself and its nominees, directors, officers and Affiliates,
required by such Section 14(f) of the

 



\- 18 -   Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The provisions of this
Section 2.03 are in addition to, and shall not limit, any right that Merger
Sub, Parent or any Affiliate of Merger Sub or Parent may have (with respect
to the election of directors or otherwise) under applicable Laws as a holder
or beneficial owner of Shares.

(d) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that Parents designees
are elected or appointed to the Company Board prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to Section 2.03(a), the prior approval of a majority of the
Continuing Directors (or the approval of the sole Continuing Director if there
shall only be one Continuing Director then in office) shall be required in
order to, prior to the Effective Time, (i) amend, modify or terminate this
Agreement, or agree or consent to any amendment, modification or termination
of this Agreement, in any case on behalf of the Company, (ii) extend the time
for performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or other acts of Parent
or Merger Sub under this Agreement, (iii) exercise or waive any of the
Companys rights under this Agreement, or (iv) amend or otherwise modify in
any material respect the Company Articles or Company By-Laws, in each case if
such action would adversely affect, or reasonably would be expected to
adversely affect, the holders of Shares (other than Parent or Merger Sub),
and such approval by a majority of the Continuing Directors (or the sole
Continuing Director if there shall only be one Continuing Director then in
office) shall constitute the authorization of the full Company Board with
respect to the action so approved, and no other action on the part of the
Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be
required to authorize, or for the Company to take, such action.

 

Section 2.04 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an option that is irrevocable
during the term of this Agreement (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 2.04, to
purchase the number of Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the
number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent,
Merger Sub and their related organizations (as defined in Section 302A.011,
Subd. 25 of the MBCA) immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option,
shall constitute up to one Share more than 90% of the Fully Diluted Shares but
not less than one Share more than 90% of the number of Shares then
outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares)
for a purchase price per Top-Up Option Share equal to the Offer Price. In no
event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable to the extent the number of
Shares issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the Companys
then authorized and unissued Shares (giving effect to Shares reserved for
issuance under the Company Equity Plans, as if such Shares were outstanding).

 

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub at any time at or after
the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time;  _provided, however,_
that the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the
exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions, unless waived by
the Company, that (i) no provision of any applicable Law, and no Order issued
by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction, shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or
the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise and (ii)
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option and delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares,
the aggregate number of Shares owned by Parent,

 



\- 19 -   Merger Sub and their related organizations (as defined in Section 302A.011,
Subd. 25 of the MBCA) shall constitute not less than one Share more than 90%
of the number of Shares then outstanding immediately after the issuance of
the Top-Up Option Shares, _provided, further,_ that the Top-Up Option shall
terminate concurrently with any termination of this Agreement. Upon exercise
of the Top-Up Option, Parent, Merger Sub and Company covenant to cause the
Closing to occur as promptly as practicable following the issuance of the Top-
Up Option Shares.

 

(c) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares is accomplished in a manner consistent with all applicable
Laws, including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of
the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act. If Merger Sub wishes to so
exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall give the Company written
notice thereof (the " _Top-Up Notice_ ") specifying a place and time for the
closing of such purchase. At such closing, (i) the purchase price in respect
of the Top-Up Option Shares purchased upon such exercise of the Top-Up Option
(which shall equal the product of (A) the number of Top-Up Option Shares
being purchased pursuant to the Top-Up Option and (B) the Offer Price) shall
be paid to the Company, at Merger Subs election, either (1) in cash, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Company, (2) by delivering to the Company Merger Subs unsecured, non-
negotiable, non-transferable promissory note in the principal amount of the
purchase price, which promissory note shall bear interest at the applicable
short term federal rate per annum for U.S. income tax purposes (as
periodically set by the IRS), shall mature on the first anniversary of the
date thereof, and may be prepaid in whole or in part without premium or
penalty, or (3) by a combination thereof and (ii) the Company shall deliver to
Merger Sub a certificate or certificates representing the number of Top-Up
Option Shares so purchased. The parties agree to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares
to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice is deemed received by the
Company and, in any event, as promptly thereafter as possible. The parties
further agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Merger to be consummated in accordance with Section 302A.621 of the MBCA as
contemplated by Section 6.03(c) as close in time as possible to (including, to
the extent possible, on the same day as) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares.

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Merger
Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger
Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act.
Any certificates evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares shall include any legends
required by applicable securities Laws.

(e) In the event of any change in the number of shares of outstanding Company
Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization,
combination, exchange of shares, merger, consolidation, reorganization or the
like or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the Company
that would have the effect of diluting Merger Subs rights under this Section
2.04, the number of and the purchase price for Top-Up Option Shares will be
adjusted appropriately so as to restore to Merger Sub its rights hereunder
with respect to the Top-Up Option as the same exists as of the date of this
Agreement, _provided_  

 



\- 20 -   that in no event will the number of Top Up Option Shares exceed the number
of Shares that are authorized in the Companys Articles of Incorporation but
are not issued and outstanding as of the date the Top Up Option is exercised
(giving effect to Shares reserved for issuance under the Company Equity Plans,
as if such Shares were outstanding).

Agreement, at the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota
articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ "), in such form as required
by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the MBCA and
shall make all other filings or recordings required under the MBCA (if any).
The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles of Merger are
duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota, or at such
later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Articles
of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective
Time_ ").

 

Section 3.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in Section 302A.641 of the MBCA.

Section 3.05 _Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws_.

the MBCA, the articles of incorporation of the Company shall be amended and
restated in their entirety to be identical to the form attached as _Exhibit A_
hereto and, from and after the Effective Time, such articles of incorporation
shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law.

 



\- 21 -  (b) From and after the Effective Time, the by-laws of Merger Sub shall be the
by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (except that all references therein to
Merger Sub shall be automatically amended and shall become references to
Surviving Corporation), until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable
Law.

 

Section 3.06 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall serve until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or their respective successors are
elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable Law, as the
case may be. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall
serve until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors have been elected or appointed and qualified in
accordance with applicable Law, as the case may be. If requested by Parent
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause
the directors and officers of each of the Company Subsidiaries (or certain of
the Company Subsidiaries as indicated by Parent) to tender their resignations
from such offices, effective as of the Effective Time, and to deliver to
Parent written evidence of such resignations at the Effective Time. 

Section 3.07 _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of the capital stock of Merger Sub,
each share of common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become

Surviving Corporation.

Section 3.08 _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of Shares the
following shall occur:

(i) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (A) any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.08(a)(ii) and
(B) any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted automatically into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a Certificate representing any such Shares or of any
Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such
Certificate or such Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 3.10, without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law.

(ii) Each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto.

 



\- 22 -  (b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares are changed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

Section 3.09  _Dissenters  Rights_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held of record or
beneficially by a Person who has not voted in favor of approval of the Merger
and adoption of the Plan of Merger and who is entitled to demand and properly
demands dissenters rights with respect to such Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_
") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Sections 302A.471 and
302A.473 of the MBCA (the " _Dissenters  Rights_"), shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such
Dissenting Shares but instead shall be entitled to payment of the fair value
(including interest determined in accordance with Section 302A.473 of the
MBCA) of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Dissenters Rights;
_provided, however,_ that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under the
Dissenters Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value
of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to
have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. If any demand for fair value
is made of Dissenting Shares and the Top-Up Option was exercised prior to the
Effective Time, then for purposes of determining the fair value of any
Dissenting Shares, the cash received and/or value of the promissory note
received by the Company in payment of the exercise price of the Top-Up Option
shall be treated as if it had not been paid to or received by the Company and
the Shares issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall be treated as if
they were not issued or outstanding.

(b) The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent and its counsel of any
demands, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company for
Dissenters Rights with respect to any Shares, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in, and direct ( _provided,_ that such direction may not
result in a binding obligation on the part of the Company that is effective
prior to the Effective Time), all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to
do any of the foregoing.

 

Section 3.10 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate and
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.10. Parent shall,
or shall take all steps necessary to enable and cause Merger Sub to, deposit
with the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Effective Time, the cash necessary
to pay for the Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.08 (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall,
pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested

 



\- 23 -   by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ that no gain or loss
thereon shall affect the amounts payable hereunder and Parent shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that the Exchange Fund includes at all times cash
sufficient to satisfy Parents obligation under this Agreement. Any net profit
resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on deposit
with the Exchange Agent will be payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise
directs, and no part of such net profits shall accrue to the benefit of
holders of the Shares.

(b)  _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person who was a holder of record of
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose Shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.08,
(i) the form of letter of transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of
stock certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or uncertificated Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (which transmittal letter shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent) and
(ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate or a Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration for each Share previously represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, net of applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to Section
3.10(f), and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall then
be canceled. In the event payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate(s)
formerly representing Shares are registered in the transfer records of the
Company, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall be
made only to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.
Until surrendered in accordance with this Section 3.10, each Certificate and
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at all times from and after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of
the Shares previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
pursuant to this ARTICLE III. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any
cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the
provisions of this ARTICLE III.

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. The Merger Consideration paid
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE III shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously
represented by such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares. From and after
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and the Surviving Corporation shall not permit any further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this ARTICLE III,
except as otherwise provided by Law.

 



\- 24 -  (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this
ARTICLE III shall thereafter only be entitled to receive from Parent (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, as general creditors thereof)
payment of their claim for Merger Consideration. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares
immediately prior to the time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by Parent
or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect
thereto pursuant to this Agreement.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Exchange Agent and the
Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, whether pursuant to Section
2.01(f), Section 3.08(a)(i) or Section 3.11, or otherwise such amounts as
Parent, Merger Sub, the Exchange Agent or the Company is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub,
the Exchange Agent or the Company, such amount shall be (i) paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority and (ii) treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the Shares or Company
Stock Options, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Exchange Agent or the Company.

Section 3.11 _Treatment of Stock Options and Restricted Stock; Employee Stock
Purchase Plan_.

(a) With respect to each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, such Company Stock Option, if unvested, shall
become vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. If the exercise
price of any such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, without any consideration being payable in
respect thereof, and have no further force or effect. If the exercise price of
any such Company Stock Option is less than the Merger Consideration, such
Company Stock Option shall

 



\- 25 -   be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for
the right to receive, in accordance with this Section 3.11(a), an amount in
cash (without interest, and net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to Section
3.10(f)) equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share payable under such Company
Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Company
Stock Option. Following the Effective Time, no Company Stock Option that was
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
and each former holder of any such Company Stock Option shall only
be entitled to receive the consideration, if any, set forth in this Section
3.11(a) in exchange for such Company Stock Option in accordance with this
Section 3.11(a). The consideration, if any, payable under this Section 3.11(a)
to each former holder of a Company Stock Option that was outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be paid by the Company to such
former holder as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

 

(b) As of the Effective Time, each share of Restricted Stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled in
exchange for the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation as
soon as practicable after the Effective Time an amount in cash (without
interest, and less all applicable deductions and withholding required by Law)
equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of
shares of Restricted Stock held pursuant to the applicable award. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall a holder of Restricted Stock be entitled
to payment with respect to the cancelled Restricted Stock under both this
Section 3.11(b) and Section 3.08(a)(i).

(c) With respect to the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended
and restated January 2011 (the " _ESPP_ "), (i) no new offering period shall
commence after the date of this Agreement and, to the extent not already
provided for under the terms of the ESPP as of the date of this Agreement, no
employees shall be permitted to begin participating in the ESPP, and no
participants shall be permitted to increase elective deferrals in respect of
the current offering period under the ESPP, in each case after the date of
this Agreement, (ii) any offering period under the ESPP that is in effect
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement shall terminate at the earlier
of (A) the closing of the offering period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time and (B) the Business Day immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and amounts credited to the accounts of participants shall be
used to purchase Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESPP, and (iii)
such Shares shall be treated as other outstanding Shares in accordance with
Section 3.08(a)(i). For the avoidance of doubt, each fractional Share held by
any participant under the ESPP will be cancelled and extinguished at
the Effective Time, and be converted into the right to receive a commensurate
fractional portion of the Merger Consideration in cash, without interest,
payable to the holder of each such fractional Share.

 

(d) The Company shall take such actions (including the adoption of any
necessary resolutions and obtaining any necessary consents) as necessary to
facilitate the actions contemplated under this Section 3.11.

Section 3.12 _Further Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of either of the Constituent Corporations,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized
in the name of each Constituent Corporation, or otherwise, to take, and shall
take, all such lawful and necessary action.

other assets or any of their businesses or operations, except where any such
failure to be in compliance has not been and would not reasonably be expected
to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No investigation or review by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened that is or would

expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice, or to the Knowledge of the Company,
oral notice, to the effect that a Governmental Authority is proposing or
threatening any amendment, termination, revocation or cancellation of any
Permit that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no basis for any amendment,
termination, revocation or cancellation of any Permit that is material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is, and since August 30, 2008 has been, in compliance with the
terms of its Permits, except where noncompliance with such Permit would not
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to

of any Permit that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in the Company Financial Statements or any Company
SEC Reports.

had, any obligations with respect to (i) a defined benefit plan (as defined in

determination letter from the IRS or is entitled to rely on a favorable
opinion issued by the IRS, and no fact or event has occurred since the date
of such determination letter which could adversely affect the qualified status
of any such Plan or the exempt status of any such trust. There have been no
prohibited transactions or breaches of any of the duties imposed
on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with
respect to the Plans that could result in any material liability or excise tax
under ERISA or the Code being imposed on the Company. There are
no investigations by any Governmental Authority, termination proceedings or

any Plan, the assets or any of the trusts under such Plan or the plan
administrator, or against any fiduciary of any Plan with respect to the
operation of the Plan (except routine claims for benefits payable under the

imposed under ERISA, the Code or applicable Law.

or (o) of the Code (" _ERISA Affiliate_ ") have incurred any outstanding
liability under Section 4062 of ERISA to the Pension Benefits Guaranty
Corporation or to a trustee appointed under Section 4042 of ERISA. No event

Subsidiaries, by reason of its affiliation with any ERISA Affiliate, to any
material Tax, fine, Lien, penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA, the
Code or other applicable Law.

409A(d)(1) of the Code and is subject to Section 409A of the Code, (i) the
written terms of such Plan have at all times since January 1, 2009 been in

director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively,

action necessary to satisfy the requirements of the nonexclusive safe harbor
with respect to such Compensation Arrangements in accordance to Rule
14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act (the approvals and actions referred to in

payments made or to be made and benefits granted or to be granted pursuant to
such Compensation Arrangements (A) were, or will be, paid or granted as
compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed, or
future services to be refrained from being performed, by such officer,
director or employee and (B) were not, and will not, be calculated based on

(ii) could reasonably be managed through the use of customary "clean-room"
arrangements pursuant to which non-employee Representatives of Parent could be

terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any

have contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of any proposed definitive
agreement(s) with respect to such Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ "), (3) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminating this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and
shall cause its financial advisors and outside counsel to, during the Notice

negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal and (4) following any negotiation described in the
immediately preceding clause (3), such Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that

following sentence) continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event
of any material revisions to the terms of an Acquisition Proposal after the
start of the Notice Period, the Company shall be required to deliver a new
written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section
6.05(d) with respect to such new written notice, and the Notice Period shall
be deemed to have re-commenced on the date of such new notice ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Notice Period with respect to any such new written notice
provided in accordance with this sentence shall be three Business Days).

counsel, that the failure to take such action would constitute a breach of
its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law,

Company Boards intention to take such action, and all material facts
relevant to such determination, not less than three Business Days prior to

taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act;  _provided, however_ , that any
disclosure regarding or related to any Acquisition Proposal other than (i) a
"stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (ii) an express rejection of any
applicable Acquisition Proposal or (iii) an express reaffirmation of the
Company Board Recommendation together with a factual description of events or
actions leading up to such disclosure that have been taken by the Company and
that are permitted under Section 6.05 or actions taken or notices delivered to
Parent by the Company that are required by Section 6.05, shall, in each case,
be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change (including for purposes of
Section 8.01(e)).

(h) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other
than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from the provisions
of "control share acquisitions" contained in any Anti-Takeover Law or
otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply (to the extent they would
otherwise apply), in each case unless such actions are taken in connection
with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g).

 

Section 6.06 _Employee Matters_.

(a) From the Effective Time until the one year anniversary of the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the compensation and benefits package provided to the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the "
_Company Employees_ ") to be substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to
the compensation and benefits package provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) To the extent not otherwise required by or resulting from the operation of
Law, Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause any applicable Parent Plan
to (i) recognize the service of each Company Employee as of the Effective Time
with either the Company or the Subsidiaries, as the case may be, as service
with Parent or its Affiliates for purposes of vesting and eligibility to
participate, other than (A) for purposes of benefit accrual under applicable
retirement plans, (B) where prior service is not credited for similarly
situated employees of Parent or its Affiliates, (C) with respect to any
Parent Plan that is frozen or grandfathered or (D) to the extent such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits; (ii) with respect to
any

 



\- 64 -   Parent Plan that is a welfare benefit plan, cause the waiver of any pre-
existing conditions, waiting period limitations, or eligibility waiting
periods with respect to such Company Employee and his or her eligible
dependents, in each case to the extent waived or satisfied under the
corresponding Plan (for a comparable level of coverage) in which such Company
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (iii)
with respect to any Parent Plan that is a medical, vision, and/or dental
plan, provide credit for deductibles, co-payments and eligible out of pocket
expenses incurred during the portion of the plan year preceding the
termination date (or transfer date) in a comparable Parent Plan for the
corresponding plan year of the Parent Plan.

(c) At Parents election, the Company shall terminate, effective as of the
day immediately preceding the Effective Time, any and all 401(k) Plans
sponsored or maintained by the Company. In such event, Parent shall receive
from the Company evidence that the Companys Plan(s) and/or program(s) have
been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or a committee
thereof (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and
approval of Parent), effective as of the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 6.06
shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Plan, (ii) give any
third party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.06 or (iii)
require Parent or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Plan or
provide any particular benefit or (B) retain the employment of any particular
employee.

(e) The Company and Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to
effectuate the provisions of Section 6.06(e) of the Disclosure Schedule.

Section 6.07 _Rule 14d-10(d)_. Prior to the scheduled expiration date of the
Offer (as it may be extended hereunder), the Company (acting through its
Compensation Committee) shall have taken all such steps as may be required to
cause any Compensation Arrangements entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to be approved or ratified (to the extent not previously so
approved or ratified) as "employment compensation, severance or other employee
benefit arrangement" by the Compensation Committee comprised solely of
"independent directors" (as described in the last sentence of Section 4.12(l))
of the Company in accordance with Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act for
purposes of satisfying the requirements of the non-exclusive safe-harbor set
forth in such Rule.

Section 6.08 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance of the
Surviving Corporation_.

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to honor all of the Companys obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer
or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") as provided in the Company Articles or Company By-Laws, in each
case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other
agreements in effect on the date hereof, accurate and complete copies of
which have been provided to Parent and are listed

 



\- 65 -   in Section 6.08(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, including provisions relating
to the advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any Action or as
permitted under applicable Law. Parents obligation under this Section
6.08(a) shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect for
a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time. During such
period, Parent shall guarantee the obligations of the Surviving Corporation
with respect to any and all amounts payable under this Section 6.08.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, purchase a "tail" officers and directors liability insurance
policy, which by its terms shall survive the Merger and shall provide each
Indemnified Party with coverage for not less than six years following the
Effective Time on terms and conditions no less favorable than the terms of the
directors and officers liability insurance policy currently maintained by
the Company (a correct and complete copy of which has been delivered to
Parent) (the " _D andO Insurance_") in respect of actions or omissions of such
officers and directors prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as
such; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend more than 250% of the current annual premium
paid by the Company for such policy (the " _Maximum Amount_ "); _provided,
further, however_ , that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to
procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent shall spend
up to the Maximum Amount to purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained
with such Maximum Amount. The Indemnified Parties may be required to make
reasonable application and provide reasonable and customary representations
and warranties to applicable insurance carriers for the purpose of obtaining
the DandO Insurance.

 

(c) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.08 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to
whom this Section 6.08 applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to
whom this Section 6.08 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 6.08, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.08).

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.08.

 

Section 6.09 _Further Action; Efforts_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any consents, approvals or waivers of third
parties with respect to any Material Contracts to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party as may be necessary for the consummation of the
Transactions or required by the terms of any Material Contract as a result of
the execution, performance or consummation of the Transactions. Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall, as promptly as practicable,
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things

 



\- 66 -   necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the
Transactions. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) make all appropriate filings and
submissions under the HSR Act and with any other Governmental Authority
pursuant to any other applicable Antitrust Laws or otherwise, as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than 10 Business Days after the date
hereof with respect to filing under the HSR Act, and shall make as promptly as
practicable any other appropriate submissions under other applicable Antitrust
Laws, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as promptly
as practicable the termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act and
any applicable foreign Antitrust Laws, and (iii) cooperate and consult with
each other in (A) determining which filings are required to be made prior to
the Effective Time with, and which material consents, approvals, permits,
notices or authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the Effective
Time from, Governmental Authorities in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and related agreements and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (B) timely making all such
filings and timely seeking all such consents, approvals, permits, notices or
authorizations.

 

(b) In connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.09(a), each of the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will
(i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other
party reasonably informed of any communication received by such party from, or
given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other
U.S. or foreign Governmental Authority and of any communication received or
given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding the Transactions and (iii) permit the other party to review
any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of
any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other
applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Section 6.09(a) and Section 6.09(b), if any objections are
asserted with respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust Law or if any
suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any
other applicable Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any
of the Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Law or which would otherwise
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as
to permit consummation of the Transactions, including in order to resolve such
objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation
of the Transactions.

(d) Parent and the Company shall prepare and submit a joint voluntary notice
with respect to the Transactions to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the
United States (" _CFIUS_ "), pursuant to Section 721 of the Defense Production
Act of 1950, as amended by the Foreign Investment and National Security Act
of 2007, as amended (" _FINSA_ "), and the

 



\- 67 -   regulations promulgated thereunder, as promptly as reasonably practicable,
but in no event later than ten Business Days after the date hereof, and shall
take any and all actions advisable, necessary or desirable to finally and
successfully secure the CFIUS Approval as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date of such submission. Such efforts shall include providing CFIUS
with any additional or supplemental information requested by CFIUS or its
member agencies during the CFIUS review process. Each of the Company, on the
one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will (i) cooperate in
all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and
in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other party reasonably
informed of any communication received by such party from, or given by such
party to, CFIUS or any other Governmental Authority and of any communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding the Transactions and (iii) permit the other party to
review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting or conference with, CFIUS or any other Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person, and to the extent permitted by CFIUS or such other applicable
Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that materials provided by the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, to the other party may be redacted
as necessary to comply with applicable Law. " _CFIUS Approval_ " means (A) the
parties shall have received a written notification issued by CFIUS that it
has determined that (1) the Transactions are not a "covered transaction" or
(2) CFIUS has concluded its review under FINSA and has determined not to
conduct a full investigation or (B) if a full investigation is deemed to be
required, the parties shall have received notification issued by CFIUS that
the United States government will not take action to prevent the consummation
of the Transactions or to impose any requirements or conditions to mitigate
any national security concerns related thereto.

(e) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Authority or
private party challenging the Merger or any other Transaction, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and
use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any
such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other Order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Transactions.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
(i) nothing in this Section 6.09 shall limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall
obligate Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates to agree to
(and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall, without the prior
written consent of Parent) (A) sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of all
or a portion of its respective business, assets or properties, or conduct its
business in a specified manner, (B) pay any amounts (other than the payment of
filing fees and expenses and fees of counsel), or grant any counterparty to
any Contract any material accommodation, (C) commence or defend any Action or
claim in respect of any threatened Action, (D) limit in any manner whatsoever
the ability of such entities to conduct, own, operate or control any of their
respective businesses, assets or properties or of the businesses, properties
or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (E) waive any of the
conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII of this Agreement.

 



\- 68 -  Section 6.10 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto agree that no public
release or announcement concerning the Transactions shall be issued by a
party without the prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as such release or
announcement may be required by applicable Law or rules or regulations of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange or NASDAQ, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow
the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement
in advance of such issuance. The parties have agreed upon the form of a joint
press release announcing the Transactions and the execution of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.11 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. If any Anti-Takeover Law is or may become
applicable to any Transaction, (a) the parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that
the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and (b) the Company Board shall take all
actions necessary to render such statutes inapplicable to any Transaction.

Section 6.12 _Securityholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without
Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

Section 6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent and Merger Sub and Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt
notice to the Company of (a) any written notice or other communication
received from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is required
in connection with the Transactions, (b) any notice from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions, (c) any Actions or claims
commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries that
relate to the Transactions, (d) the discovery of any fact or circumstance, or
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, that would cause
any representation or warranty made by such party contained in this Agreement
to be, with respect to the Company, untrue or inaccurate such that the Offer
Conditions would not be satisfied, and (e) any failure of such party to comply
with or satisfy any covenant or obligation required to be performed or
complied with by it hereunder; _provided, however_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.13 shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-
compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice, _provided, further_ ,
that a failure to comply with this Section 6.13, in and of itself, will not
constitute a failure of any Offer Condition to be satisfied unless (A) such
failure materially prejudices another partys ability to exercise its rights
or remedies hereunder prior to the Closing or (B) the underlying event would
independently, individually or together with any other events or
circumstances, result in the failure of an Offer Condition to be satisfied.

Section 6.14  _Company SEC Reports_. From the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, the Company shall timely file with the SEC all Company SEC
Reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act. As of its filing date, or if amended after the

 



\- 69 -   date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment, each such
Company SEC Report shall comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be.
As of its filing date or, if amended after the date of this Agreement, as of
the date of the last such amendment, each such Company SEC Report filed
pursuant to the Exchange Act shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each Company
SEC Report that is a registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if
applicable, filed after the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Securities
Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment became effective
after to the date of this Agreement, shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Section 6.15 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. After the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and the rules
and policies of NASDAQ to enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation
of the Company Common Stock from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Company
Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, and in any event no more than 10 days thereafter.

party, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the

(c) waive compliance with any agreement of the other party or any condition to
its own obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be
valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Company or
Parent (on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub). The waiver by any party hereto of
a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision

Section 9.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy or the application of this Agreement to any Person or
circumstance is invalid or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. To such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be
severable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 9.04 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with
the NDA and the Disclosure Schedule and all exhibits and annexes hereto and
thereto, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned, whether pursuant
to a

 



\- 74 -   merger, by operation of law or otherwise; _provided_ that Merger Sub may
assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to any wholly-owned direct or indirect
Subsidiary of Parent without the consent of the Company.

Section 9.05 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that money damages
would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, and
accordingly, the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent beaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms hereof, without
proof of damages or otherwise, and without any requirement to post bond, in
addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

Section 9.06 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than (a) as provided in Section 6.08 (which
are intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby or the
Persons entitled to payment thereunder and may be enforced by such Persons)
and (b) the right of the Company on behalf of the Company shareholders to
pursue damages in the event of Parents or Merger Subs intentional breach of
this Agreement (a claim with respect to which shall be enforceable only by
the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, on behalf of the Company
shareholders).

Section 9.07  _Governing Law; Forum_.

(a) All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or
the Transactions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York (except to the extent that the MBCA is
applicable) without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision
or rule that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other
than the State of New York.

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard
and determined in the United States District Court For the Southern District
of New York. The parties hereby (i) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the United States District Court For the Southern District of New York for the
purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by
any party and (ii) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of
motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named court, that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action
is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is
improper, or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or
by any of the above-named courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any action or
proceeding in the manner provided in Section 9.02 or such other manner as may
be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service of process.

 

Section 9.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION

 



\- 75 -   DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. Each of the parties (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the
Transactions, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 9.08.

Section 9.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or other form of electronic transmission) in two or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
