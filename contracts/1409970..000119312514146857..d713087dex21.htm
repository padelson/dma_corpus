within 90 days after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the PPS Agent a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting
forth Purchasers calculation of Company Net Working Capital. After the
delivery of the Closing Statement in accordance with this Section 1.4(b),
Purchaser shall provide to the PPS Agent and its Representatives such
information as they may reasonably request to the extent necessary for the
purpose of reviewing the Closing Statement.

 

(c) Unless the PPS Agent notifies Purchaser in writing within 30 days after
Purchasers delivery of the Closing Statement in accordance with Section
1.4(b) of any objection to the computations set forth in the Closing Statement
(the " _Notice of Objection_ "), together with reasonable supporting detail
with respect to the basis of such objection, the Closing Statement and
Purchasers calculations of Company Net Working Capital shall be final and
binding for all purposes hereunder. Any Notice of Objection shall specify in
reasonable detail the basis for the objections set forth therein and
shall include the PPS Agents calculation of any amounts that are disputed by
such Notice of Objection (the " _Disputed Amounts_ ").

 

(d) If the PPS Agent provides the Notice of Objection to Purchaser in
accordance with Section 1.4(c), then Purchaser and the PPS Agent shall confer
in good faith for a period of up to 30 days following Purchasers receipt of
the Notice of Objection in an attempt to resolve any Disputed Amounts set
forth in the Notice of Objection, and any resolution by them shall be in
writing and shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and the PPS
Stockholders. If, after the 30-day period set forth in this Section 1.4(d),
Purchaser and the PPS Agent cannot resolve any matter set forth in the Notice
of Objection, then Purchaser and the PPS Agent shall engage an independent
accounting firm not affiliated with either Purchaser or the Company (the "
_Accounting Firm_ ") to review only the Disputed Amounts that are then still
disputed by Purchaser and the PPS Agent. After such review and a review of
the Companys

 



9  relevant books and records, the Accounting Firm shall promptly (and in any
case within 30 days after its engagement) determine the resolution of the
Disputed Amounts. The Accounting Firm shall only resolve the Disputed Amounts
by choosing the amounts submitted by either Purchaser or the PPS Agent or
amounts in between. The Company and the PPS Agent shall each furnish to the
Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and information relating
to the Disputed Amounts as the Accounting Firm may request. The resolution of
the Disputed Amounts by the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto and the PPS Stockholders, and the determination of
the Accounting Firm shall constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding
and unappealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having
jurisdiction thereover. The date on which Company Net Working Capital is
finally determined in accordance with Section 1.4(c) or this Section 1.4(d)
is hereinafter referred to as the " _Determination Date_."

 

(e) " _Post-Closing NWC Adjustment_ " means an amount, positive or negative,
equal to (x) the amount of Company Net Working Capital as finally determined
pursuant to Section 1.4(b), Section 1.4(c) or Section 1.4(d), as the case may
be, minus (y) the Company Net Working Capital Baseline. " _Company Net Working
Capital Baseline_ " means the Company Net Working Capital Target, except
where the amount of Company Net Working Capital set forth in the Company
Closing Financial Certificate is less than the amount of the Company Net
Working Capital Target, in which case Company Net Working Capital Baseline
means the amount of Company Net Working Capital set forth in the Company
Closing Financial Certificate.

 

(i) In the event that the Post-Closing NWC Adjustment is positive and equals

with this Agreement, the Purchase and the other agreements or actions
contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser agrees to report the Purchase

which such deduction and withholding was made.

any Lien on any of the material assets of the Company or any Interest or (ii)
conflict with, or result in any violation of or default under (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both), or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation or loss of any
material benefit under, or require any consent, approval or waiver from any
Person pursuant to, (A) any provision of the Certificate of Formation, as
amended to date, (B) any Material Contract or (C) any Applicable Law.

required by or with respect to the Company in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the Purchase, except
for such consents, approvals, Orders, authorizations, registrations,

obligations of the Company herein or to consummate the Purchase in accordance
with this Agreement and Applicable Law.

 

2.4 _Financial Statements; Absence of Changes_.

 

(a) The Company has delivered to Purchaser its audited financial statements
for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013
(including, in each case, balance sheets, statements of operations, statements
of changes in members equity and statements of cash flows), and its unaudited
balance sheets (the " _Interim Financial Statements_ ") as of the months
ended January 31, 2014,

 



13  February 28, 2014 and March 31, 2014 (such audited financial statements and
the Interim Financial Statements, collectively, the " _Financial Statements_
"), which are included as Schedule 2.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
The Financial Statements (i) are derived from and in accordance with the books
and records of the Company, (ii) complied as to form with applicable
accounting requirements with respect thereto as of their respective dates,
(iii) fairly and accurately present the financial condition of the Company at
the dates therein indicated and, as applicable, the results of operations and
cash flows of the Company for the periods therein specified and (iv) were
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved, subject, in the case of Interim Financial Statements, to
normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments (none of which individually
or in the aggregate will be material in amount) and the absence of footnotes.

(b) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.4(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company has no Liabilities of any nature other than (i) those
set forth or adequately provided for in the unaudited balance sheet included
in the Financial Statements as of March 31, 2014 (such balance sheet, the "
_Company Balance Sheet_ ," and such date, the " _Company Balance Sheet Date_
"), (ii) those incurred in the conduct of the Companys business since the
Company Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice that are of the type that ordinarily recur and, individually or
in the aggregate, are not material in nature or amount and do not result from
any breach of Contract, warranty, infringement, tort or violation of
Applicable Law or (iii) those incurred by the Company in connection with the
execution of this Agreement. Except for Liabilities reflected in the Financial
Statements, the Company has no off-balance sheet Liability of any nature to,
or any financial interest in, any third parties or entities, the purpose or
effect of which is to defer, postpone, reduce or otherwise avoid or adjust the
recording of expenses incurred by the Company. All reserves that are set
forth in or reflected in the Company Balance Sheet, including reserves for
losses related to Loans issued by the Banks pursuant to the Programs, have,
except as set forth on Schedule 2.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
been established in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and are
adequate. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as set
forth on Schedule 2.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has
never guaranteed any debt or other obligation of any other Person.

(c) The Company does not have any outstanding Long-Term Company Debt.

 

(d) Schedule 2.4(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the names
and locations of all banks and other financial institutions at which the

withdrawals therefrom.

(e) The accounts receivable of the Company (the " _Accounts Receivable_ ") as
reflected on the Company Balance Sheet and as will be reflected in the Company
Closing Financial Certificate arose in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice and represent _bona fide_ claims against
debtors for sales and other charges, and have been collected or are
collectible in the book amounts thereof within 60 days following the Agreement
Date, less an amount not in excess of the allowance for doubtful accounts
provided for in the Company Balance Sheet or in the Company Closing Financial
Certificate, as the case may be. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.4(e)(i) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, allowances for doubtful accounts and refunds
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and in
accordance with the Companys past practice and are sufficient to provide for
any losses that may be sustained on realization of the applicable Accounts
Receivable. The Accounts Receivable arising after the Company Balance Sheet
Date and before the Closing Date (i) arose or shall arise in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) represented or shall
represent _bona fide_ claims against debtors for sales and other charges and
(iii) except as set forth on Schedule 2.4(e)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, have been collected or are collectible in the book amounts thereof
within 60 days following the Agreement Date, less allowances for doubtful
accounts and refunds determined in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
and the Companys past

 



14  practice that are or shall be sufficient to provide for any losses that may
be sustained on realization of the applicable Accounts Receivable. None of the
Accounts Receivable is subject to any claim of offset, recoupment, set-off or
counter-claim and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or
circumstances (whether asserted or unasserted) that could give rise to any
such claim. No material amount of Accounts Receivable is contingent upon the
performance by the Company of any obligation or Contract. No Person has any
Lien on any Accounts Receivable, and no agreement for deduction or discount
has been made with respect to any such Accounts Receivable. Schedule
2.4(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the Agreement
Date, (i) the aggregate amount of Accounts Receivable that were subject to
asserted refund claims made within the last year and the number of such claims
made within the last year, (ii) the aggregate number and amount of such
refund claims that were actually paid within the last year and (iii) with
respect to each of clauses (i) and (ii), the aggregate distribution of such
refund claims by type.

 

(f) The Company has established and maintains a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances (i) that transactions,
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being executed and made only in
accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and the Companys
board of managers, (ii) that transactions are recorded as necessary (A) to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and (B) to
maintain accountability for assets, (iii) regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of
Company and (iv) that the amount recorded for assets on the books and records
of the Company is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals
and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. None of
the Company, the Companys independent auditors and, to the knowledge of the
Company, any current or former employee or consultant of the Company, has
identified or been made aware of any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves the Companys management or other current or former employees or
consultants of the Company who have a role in the preparation of financial
statements or the internal accounting controls utilized by the Company, or any
claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing. Except as set forth on
Schedule 2.4(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company and,
to the knowledge of the Company, the Representatives of the Company has
received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, in each case,
regarding deficient accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company or its internal accounting controls or
any material inaccuracy in the Companys financial statements. No attorney
representing the Company, whether or not employed by the Company, has reported
to the Company Board or any committee thereof or to any officer of the Company
evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty
or similar violation by the Company or its Representatives. There are no
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
the Companys internal controls that could adversely affect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data. Except as set
forth on Schedule 2.4(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there has been no
change in the Company accounting policies since the Companys inception,

any material Intellectual Property or any other material intangible assets of
the Company;

(v) any creation of any Lien on any material property of the Company, except
for Permitted Liens;

set forth on Schedule 2.4(g)(x) of the Company Disclosure Schedule;

(xi) any increase in, or modification of, the compensation or benefits
payable or to become payable by the Company to any of its directors, employees

salaries) or any new loans or extension of existing loans to any such Persons
(excluding advancement of expenses to employees in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice), and the Company has not entered into
any Contract to grant or provide (nor has granted any) severance, acceleration
of vesting or other similar benefits to any such Persons, except as set forth

16 (xii) any execution of any employment agreements or service Contracts (other

their employment, services or relationship with the Company), and to the
knowledge of the Company, there is not a reasonable basis for any such
Proceeding. There is no Order against the Company, any of its assets or, to
the knowledge of the Company, any of its directors, officers or employees (in

of Labor other than ordinary claims for benefits.

recent full fiscal year included in the Financial Statements.

faith believes may result in a claim for Indemnifiable Damages by or on behalf
of an Indemnified Person, Purchaser shall have the right in its

 



53  sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle or resolve, any
such Third-Party Claim (and the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by
Purchaser in connection with such defense, settlement or resolution
(including reasonable attorneys fees, other professionals and experts fees
and court or arbitration costs) shall be included in the Indemnifiable Damages
for which Purchaser shall be entitled to receive indemnification pursuant to
a claim made hereunder, and such costs and expenses shall constitute
Indemnifiable Damages subject to indemnification under Section 7.2 regardless
of whether it is ultimately determined that such Third-Party Claim arose out
of, resulted from or was in connection with a matter listed in Section 7.2;
_provided_ that (i) such costs and expenses shall be so included with respect
to a Third-Party Claim only to the extent that an Indemnified Person would be
entitled to recover for such costs and expenses as Indemnifiable Damages
arising out of, resulting from or in connection with a matter listed in
Section 7.2 assuming that such Third-Party Claim were ultimately determined in
favor of the third party making such Third-Party Claim and (ii) if any Third-
Party Claim is determined to have asserted both claims that arose out of,
resulted from or were in connection with a matter listed in Section 7.2 and
claims that did not, such Indemnifiable Damages shall include only the amount
of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Purchaser in connection with
defense, settlement or resolution of such Third-Party Claim as may be
apportioned to claims that substantially arose out of, resulted from or were
in connection with a matter listed in Section 7.2). Purchaser shall promptly
provide to one representative designated by the PPS Agent (on behalf of PPS
and the PPS Stockholders) and one representative designated by NBT (such
Sellers " _Litigation Representative_ ") copies of all pleadings, notices,
demands and communications with respect to such Third-Party Claim. After
execution of a joint defense/common interest agreement, each Sellers
Litigation Representative shall have reasonable access to counsel defending
such matter to obtain an assessment of the defense of such matter, subject to
execution by such Sellers Litigation Representative of Purchasers (and, if
required, such third partys) reasonable non-disclosure agreement to the
extent that such materials contain confidential or propriety information;
_provided_ that, if the provision of such pleadings, notices, demands
and/or communications would affect any privilege relating to any Indemnified
Person, such Sellers Litigation Representative shall enter into a joint
defense/common interest agreement with Purchaser solely to the extent
necessary to preserve such privilege. Purchaser shall have the right in its
sole discretion to determine and conduct the defense of, and to settle or
resolve, any Third-Party Claim; _provided_ that each Sellers Litigation
Representative shall be permitted to consult (in a non-binding fashion) with
Purchaser on any dispositive motions related to such defense or any such
settlement. Any costs and expenses of a Sellers Litigation Representative
shall be borne by such Seller. Unless otherwise consented to in writing in
advance by Purchaser in its sole discretion, the PPS Agent or NBT, as
applicable, and their Affiliates may not participate in any way not expressly
provided in this Section 7.8 in any Third-Party Claim. Except with the
consent of the PPS Agent or NBT, as applicable, which consent shall be deemed
to have been given unless the PPS Agent or NBT, as applicable, shall have
objected within 15 days after a written request for such consent by Purchaser,
no settlement or resolution by Purchaser of any such Third-Party Claim shall
be determinative of the existence of or amount of Indemnifiable Damages
relating to such matter. In the event that the PPS Agent or NBT, as
applicable, has consented to any such settlement or resolution, neither the
PPS Agent nor NBT shall have any power or authority to object under Section
7.6 or any other provision of this Article VII to the amount of any claim by
or on behalf of any Indemnified Person against the PPS Indemnity Escrow Fund
or the NBT Indemnity Escrow Fund, as applicable, for indemnity with respect to
such settlement or resolution.

 

7.9 _Third-Party Claims Regarding NBT_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, in the event NBT is a named defendant in any legal
or regulatory proceeding, it will retain the right to conduct its own defense
independent of Purchaser or any other Indemnified Person. Furthermore, in the
event that any Third-Party Claim either (i) includes a demand for, and could
reasonably foreseeably result in, Indemnifiable Damages payable by or
otherwise attributed to NBT in excess of the amount of the NBT Indemnity
Escrow Fund or (ii) includes an allegation that NBT was in violation of law or
regulation, NBT and Purchaser shall enter into a mutually agreeable joint
defense/common interest

 



54  agreement (which will address conflicts of interest, separate representation
and other relevant matters), and NBT and Purchaser shall jointly defend and
cooperate in the defense, settlement and/or resolution of such matters,
subject to the terms of such agreement, to the extent reasonably required to
protect NBTs and Purchasers respective interests; _provided_ that Purchaser
shall be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to, and subject to any
limitations set forth in, this Article VII.

7.10 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Purchaser, the PPS Agent and
the Sellers agree to treat (and cause their respective Affiliates to treat)
any payment received by the Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Article VII
as adjustments to the Purchase Consideration for all Tax purposes, to the
maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law.

ARTICLE VIII

VII in respect of any claim that is set forth in an Claim
Certificate delivered to the PPS Agent prior to the expiration of the

shall not affect the rights of any Indemnified Person under Article VII or
otherwise to seek recovery of Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting
from or in connection with any fraud or intentional misrepresentation by or on
behalf of the Company until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations. If the Purchase is consummated, the representations and
warranties made by Purchaser herein and in the other certificates contemplated
by this Agreement shall expire and be of no further force or effect as of
the Closing. If the Purchase is consummated, all covenants, agreements and
obligations of the parties hereto shall expire and be of no further force or
effect as of the Closing, except to the extent such covenants, agreements and
obligations provide that they are to be performed after the Closing;
_provided_ that no right to indemnification pursuant to Article VII in respect
of any claim based upon any breach of a covenant, agreement or obligation
shall be affected by the expiration of such covenant, agreement or
obligation.

subsections, Schedules or Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Article,
Section or subsection of, or a Schedule or an Exhibit to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The headings contained herein are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used
herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Where a reference is made to a Contract, instrument or Law, such
reference is to such Contract, instrument or Law as amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of Contracts or instruments) by waiver or
consent and (in the case of Law) by succession of comparable successor Law
and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated
therein. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires: (i) words of
any gender include each other gender and neutral forms of such words, (ii)
words using the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular
number, respectively, (iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereto,"

subsection are references to clauses within the same Section or, if more

respectively, or its Representatives no later than on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Agreement Date. The symbol "$" refers to United
States Dollars. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the

8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to Applicable Law, (i) the parties hereto may amend
this Agreement by authorized action at any time by execution of an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto and (ii) Purchaser
and the PPS Agent may amend this Agreement at any time after the Closing by
execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of Purchaser and the
PPS Agent.

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time at or prior to the Closing, any party
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto owed to such party, (i) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive any breaches of any of the
covenants, agreements, obligations or conditions for the benefit of such

 



57  party contained herein. Subject to Applicable Law, at any time after the
Closing, Purchaser and the PPS Agent may (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations of the other owed to such party, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (iii)
waive any breaches of any of the covenants, agreements, obligations or
conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing that is
(x) prior to the Closing with respect to the Company and/or the
Sellers, signed by the Company, (y) after the Closing with respect to the
Sellers and/or the PPS Agent, signed by the PPS Agent and (z) with respect to
Purchaser, signed by Purchaser. Without limiting the generality or effect of
the preceding sentence, no failure to exercise or delay in exercising any
right under this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such right, and no
waiver of any breach or default shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach
or default of the same or any other provision herein.

8.6 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties
hereto; _it_ _being_ _understood_ that all parties hereto need not sign the
same counterpart. The delivery by facsimile or by electronic delivery in PDF
format of this Agreement with all executed signature pages (in counterparts or
otherwise) shall be sufficient to bind the parties hereto to the terms and
conditions set forth herein. All of the counterparts will together constitute
one and the same instrument and each counterpart will constitute an original
of this Agreement.

 

8.7 _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement and the documents
and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or
delivered pursuant hereto, including all the exhibits attached hereto, the
Schedules, including the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) constitute the
entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof,
except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force
and effect, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in
accordance with its terms and (ii) are not intended to confer, and shall not
be construed as conferring, upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder (except that Article VII is intended to benefit
the Indemnified Persons). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
this Section 8.7 be read to terminate or limit in any manner any rights
conferred upon a PPS Stockholder pursuant to the terms of a Stock Transfer
Agreement executed by such PPS Stockholder.

8.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights
and obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole
or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except
(i) pursuant to a Stock Transfer Agreement and (ii) that Purchaser may assign
its rights and delegate its obligations under this Agreement to any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser without the prior consent of
any other party hereto; _provided_ that, notwithstanding any such assignment,
Purchaser shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.8, NBT may assign
the right to receive the shares of Purchaser Stock issuable to NBT pursuant to
Section 1.1(a)(ii)(B) to NBT Financial Services, Inc. at or after the Closing,
in which event (i) NBT shall cause such assignee to execute and deliver such
documents required to be executed and delivered by NBT pursuant to Section
1.2(b) in connection with the issuance of such shares of Purchaser Stock to
NBT and (ii) references herein to NBT with respect to such shares of
Purchaser Stock shall be deemed also to be references to such assignee, as
applicable; _provided_ that, notwithstanding any such assignment, NBT shall
remain liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the
two immediately preceding sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns.

 



58 8.9 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably necessary to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

8.10 _Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties hereto would not have
any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, and the parties hereto hereby waive the requirement of any posting of
a bond in connection with the remedies described herein. Subject to Section
8.13, if any Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of any
provision hereof is brought by any party hereto against any other party
hereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable
attorneys fees, costs and disbursements, in addition to any other relief to
which the prevailing party may be entitled at law or in equity.

8.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE PURCHASE OR THE AGREEMENTS OR ACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THOSE OF PURCHASER, THE COMPANY,
THE SELLERS OR THE PPS AGENT IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 

8.12 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_ This Agreement, all acts and
transactions pursuant hereto and all obligations of the parties hereto shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware without reference to such states principles of conflicts of law that
would refer a matter to a different jurisdiction. Subject to Section 8.13,
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Delaware Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery Court shall be
unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware or any Federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware) solely in respect of the enforcement
of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any
action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is
not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought
or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced
in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims
with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in
such a Delaware State or Federal court. The parties hereby consent to and
grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the
subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided
in Section 8.11 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Applicable
Law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. With respect to any
particular action, suit or proceeding, venue shall lie solely in New Castle
County, Delaware.

 

8.13 _Disputed Matters_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, and
to the fullest extent permitted by law, any dispute, claim or controversy (in
law or in equity) arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including the
documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to

 



59  herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including all the exhibits attached
hereto, the Schedules, including the Company Disclosure Schedule) or the
breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof,
including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to
arbitrate, (collectively, a " _Dispute_ ") shall be resolved as follows ("
_Dispute Resolution_ "): (i) any Dispute shall first be submitted to
mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association, which shall be
concluded within 60 days following receipt of a written demand for mediation
by any party hereto, and (ii) if mediation is unsuccessful, such Dispute
shall be determined by arbitration (" _Arbitration_ ") in Chicago, Illinois,
before a panel of three qualified arbitrators having reasonable experience in
transactions of the type provided for in this Agreement to be administered by
the American Arbitration Association and employing its commercial arbitration
rules then in effect. Any agreement of the applicable parties obtained from
any such mediation or any award or decision obtained from any such
Arbitration proceeding shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law, be final and binding on the parties hereto and the PPS Stockholders,
shall be un-appealable and judgment upon any award thus obtained may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. To the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law, no Proceeding based upon any claim arising out
of, related to or in connection with this Agreement (including the documents
and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or
delivered pursuant hereto, including all the exhibits attached hereto, the
Schedules, including the Company Disclosure Schedule) shall be initiated in
any court by any party hereto except a Proceeding (i) to obtain a preliminary
injunction or other equitable relief pending the outcome of a mediation or
arbitration proceeding commenced pursuant to this Section 8.13, (ii) to compel
mediation and/or arbitration or (iii) to enforce an agreement of
the applicable parties obtained in a mediation or a decision or award
obtained in an Arbitration. In any Arbitration in which the amount of
Indemnifiable Damages claimed by an Indemnified Person and set forth in a
Claim Certificate is disputed in accordance with Section 7.6 and this Section
8.13, the arbitrator shall determine the amount (whether all, none or a
portion of such claimed amount) for which such Indemnified Person shall be
indemnified and held harmless pursuant to Section 7.2. In any Arbitration,
the arbitrator shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the reasonable
costs and attorneys fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in
connection with such Arbitration. If the arbitrator(s) determine a party to
be the prevailing party under circumstances where the prevailing party
prevailed on some but not all of the claims and counterclaims or did not fully
prevail in its position regarding damages, the arbitrator(s) may award
the prevailing party an appropriate percentage of the costs and attorneys
fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with such
Arbitration.

 

8.14 _Rules of Construction_ The parties hereto have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement, each Schedule
and each Exhibit attached hereto, the application of any Applicable Law or
rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.
