         SECTION 2.01. The Merger. At the Effective Time, and subject to and
upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall be merged (the
"MERGER") with and into the Company in accordance with the MBCA, whereupon the

<PAGE>   10

         SECTION 2.02. The Effective Time. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated and the transactions herein contemplated shall have been abandoned
pursuant to Section 10.01, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
three business days) after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article 9, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
a certificate of merger as contemplated by the MBCA (the "CERTIFICATE OF
MERGER"), together with any required related certificates, with the Department
of Consumer and Industry Services of the State of Michigan, in such form as
required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the
MBCA. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "EFFECTIVE TIME") as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Department of Consumer and
Industry Services of the State of Michigan or at such later time as may be
specified in the Certificate of Merger. Prior to such filing a closing shall be
held at the offices of Dykema Gossett PLLC, 39577 North Woodward Avenue, Suite
300, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, unless another date, time or place is agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto for the purpose of confirming the satisfaction
or waiver, as the case may be, of the conditions set forth in Article 9.

         SECTION 2.03. Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect
of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger
and the applicable provisions of the MBCA. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

         SECTION 2.04. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

         (a) each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section
2.04(b)), shall be converted into the right to receive $13.00, in cash (the
"MERGER CONSIDERATION"); each such Share shall no longer be outstanding, shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate formerly representing any such Shares shall, to the extent such
certificate formerly represented such Shares, cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon
surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.05;

         (b) each Share owned by Parent or any of Parent's Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall
be made with respect thereto; and

         (c) each share of common stock, without par value, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, without par value, of the Surviving Corporation.





                                        6

<PAGE>   11



         SECTION 2.05.   Payment for Shares.

         (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as paying agent in
connection with the Merger (the "PAYING AGENT") pursuant to a paying agent
agreement providing for the matters set forth in this Section 2.05 and otherwise
reasonably satisfactory to the Company. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust with the Paying Agent for the
benefit of holders of Shares the aggregate consideration to which such holders
shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.04. Such funds
shall be invested as directed by the Surviving Corporation pending payment
thereof by the Paying Agent to holders of the Shares. Earnings from such
investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Surviving
Corporation and no part thereof shall accrue to the benefit of the holders of
the Shares.

         (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Paying Agent shall mail to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an
outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding Shares (the "CERTIFICATES"), whose Shares were
converted pursuant to Section 2.04 into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be
in such form and have such other provisions not inconsistent with this Agreement
as the Surviving Corporation shall specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration (together, the "TRANSMITTAL DOCUMENTS"). Upon surrender of
a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented
by such Certificate, without any interest thereon, and less any applicable
withholding taxes, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of and as
contemplated by this Section 2.05 each Certificate (other than Certificates
representing Shares subject to Section 2.04(b)) shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.05. Upon the surrender
of Certificates in accordance with the terms and instructions contained in the
Transmittal Documents, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay the holder of
such Certificates in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares represented by such Certificate
(other than Certificates representing Shares subject to Section 2.04(b)).

         (c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form




                                        7

<PAGE>   12



for transfer, that the signatures on the Certificate or any related stock power
shall be properly guaranteed and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

         (d) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
evidencing ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as
otherwise provided herein or by applicable law.

         (e) Promptly following the date which is six (6) months after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any cash (including any earnings and interest
received with respect thereto), Certificates and other documents in its
possession relating to the Merger, which had been made available to the Paying
Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of their Certificates, without any interest thereon and the Paying
Agent's duties shall terminate.

         (f) Parent or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder of the Shares such amounts as Parent or the Paying Agent is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by Parent or the Paying Agent.

         (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.05, none
of the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder of a Certificate formerly representing Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. If Certificates are not surrendered prior to two (2)
years after the Effective Time, unclaimed funds payable with respect to such
Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

         SECTION 2.06. Stock Options; Restricted Stock. (a) At or immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding stock option to purchase Shares
granted under any of the Option Plans, shall be canceled, and each holder of any
such option, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be paid by the
Surviving Corporation promptly after the Effective Time for each such option, in
consideration therefor an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the
excess, if any, of $13.00 per Share over the applicable exercise price of such
option by (ii) the number of Shares such holder could have purchased (assuming
full vesting of all options) had such holder exercised such option in full
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall use all reasonable
efforts to




                                        8

<PAGE>   13



effectuate the foregoing, including without limitation, amending the Option
Plans and obtaining any necessary consents from the holders of such options.

         (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all restricted stock
awards granted under any Option Plan shall be treated as having vested and all
restrictions pertaining to such awards shall be treated as having lapsed.

         SECTION 2.07. Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall not be any further
registration of transfers of any shares of capital stock thereafter on the
records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in
this Article 2. No interest shall accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon the
surrender of a Certificate or Certificates which immediately before the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares.

         SECTION 2.08. No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares. The Merger
Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange of Shares in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such Shares, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of Shares
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 2.

         SECTION 2.09. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article;
provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion and as
a condition precedent to the payment thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

         SECTION 2.10. Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Company and Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time are fully authorized in the name of
their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such
lawful and necessary action.

                            THE SURVIVING CORPORATION


         SECTION 3.01. Articles of Incorporation. The Articles of Incorporation
of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
applicable law; provided that, at the Effective Time, Article I of such Articles
of Incorporation shall be amended to read that the name of the corporation is
the same as the name of the Company.

         SECTION 3.02.  Bylaws.  The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with applicable law.

         SECTION 3.03. Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective
Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance
with applicable law, (i) the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall

Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY


         The Company represents and warrants to Parent that, except as set forth
in the section or subsection of the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company
to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE")
corresponding to the relevant section or subsection of this Article 4:

         SECTION 4.01. Corporate Existence and Power. The Company is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Michigan and has all corporate powers and all governmental
licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to own or
lease and operate its assets and to carry on its business as now conducted,
except for those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the
absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. The Company has heretofore delivered to Parent true and complete copies
of the Articles of Incorporation and bylaws of the Company as currently in
effect.

         SECTION 4.02.  Corporate Authorization.

         (a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby are
within the Company's corporate powers and, except for the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares in connection with the
consummation of the Merger, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Company. The affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Shares is the only vote of the holders of any of the
Company's capital stock necessary or required under applicable law or the
Company's Articles of Incorporation and bylaws in connection with the
consummation of the Merger. This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company.

         (b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Board of Directors has (i)
determined that this Agreement and the Merger are fair to and in the best
interests of the shareholders of the Company (other than Parent and its
Affiliates), (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the Merger and (iii)
resolved (subject to Section 6.04) to recommend approval and adoption of the
Merger and this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company.

         SECTION 4.03. Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in respect of,

(i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Michigan Department of
Consumer and Industry Services Corporation, Securities and Land Development
Bureau, and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states
in which the Company is qualified to do business, (ii) compliance with any
applicable requirements of the HSR Act and of laws, rules and regulations
analogous to the HSR Act existing in foreign jurisdictions, (iii) compliance
with any applicable requirements of the 1934 Act and any other applicable
securities laws, whether state or foreign, and (iv) any actions or filings the
absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As provided by Section
762(2)(b) of the MBCA, no shareholder is entitled to dissent from the Merger.
Neither the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or any applicable law provide
the shareholders with, nor has the board provided, pursuant to resolution or
otherwise, the shareholders with, a right to dissent from the Merger in
accordance with the provisions of Section 762 of the MBCA.

         SECTION 4.04. Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, (ii) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a
violation or breach of any provision of any applicable law, statute, ordinance,
rule, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree, (iii) require any
consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a default under, or



                                       11

<PAGE>   16



cause or permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of
any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any agreement or other
instrument binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any license,
franchise, permit, certificate, approval or other similar authorization
affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets or business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any
asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries except for such contraventions,
conflicts and violations referred to in clause (ii) and for such failures to
obtain any such consent or other action, default, termination, cancellation,
acceleration, change, loss or Lien referred to in clauses (iii) and (iv) that
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

         SECTION 4.05.  Capitalization.

         (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 55,000,000
Shares. As of the close of business on September 27, 2000, there were
outstanding 17,874,374 Shares (including all shares of restricted stock
outstanding under the Option Plans) and employee stock options to purchase an
aggregate of 1,009,430 Shares (of which options to purchase an aggregate of
410,388 Shares were exercisable). All shares of capital stock of the Company
outstanding as of the date hereof have been duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid and nonassessable. All Shares issuable upon exercise of
outstanding stock options have been duly authorized and, when issued, will have
been validly issued and will be fully paid and nonassessable.

         (b) Except as set forth in this Section 4.05 and for changes since
September 27, 2000 resulting from the award or grant of options or Shares
awarded under the Option Plans, each in the ordinary course of business, or the
exercise of stock options outstanding on such date, there are no outstanding (i)
shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company, (ii) securities of
the Company convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or
voting securities of the Company or (iii) options or other rights to acquire
from the Company or other obligation of the Company to issue, any capital stock,
voting securities or securities convertible into, exercisable for, or
exchangeable for capital stock or voting securities of the Company or (iv) stock
appreciation, phantom stock or similar rights with respect to the Company (the
items in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) being referred to collectively as the
"COMPANY SECURITIES"). There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the
Company Securities.

         (c) A list of the holders of options, the number of options held by
each such holder, the exercise prices and the date of grant of each such option
are set forth in Section 4.05(c) of the Disclosure Schedule. A list of the
holders of Restricted Stock, the number of Shares of Restricted Stock held by
each such holder and the date of grant is set forth in Section 4.05(c) of the
Disclosure Schedule.

         SECTION 4.06.  Subsidiaries.

         (a) Each Subsidiary of the Company is a corporation duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation, has all corporate powers and all governmental licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to own and lease its
assets and carry on its business as now conducted, except for those licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. Each such Material Subsidiary is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

         (b) All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other voting securities
or ownership interests in, each Material Subsidiary of the Company (other than
director qualifying shares) is owned by the Company, directly or indirectly,
free and clear of any Lien and free of any other limitation or restriction
(including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of
such capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests). All of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary of the Company have
been validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. There are no
outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible
into, exercisable for, or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other
voting securities or ownership interests in any Material Subsidiary of the
Company, (ii) options or other rights to acquire from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or other obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
issue, any capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in,
or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any capital stock or
other voting securities or ownership interests in, any Material Subsidiary of
the Company or (iii) stock appreciation, phantom stock or similar rights with
respect to any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in clauses (i), (ii) or
(iii) being referred to collectively as the "COMPANY SUBSIDIARY SECURITIES").
There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company Subsidiary
Securities.

         (c) Schedule 4.06(c) lists any equity interest owned by the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company in any other corporation, partnership, joint
venture or other business association or entity owned directly or indirectly by
the Company and having a fair market value or book value in excess of $100,000.

         SECTION 4.07.  SEC Filings.

         (a) The Company has made available to Parent (i) the Company's annual
reports on Form 10-K for its fiscal years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and

<PAGE>   18



of its other reports, statements, schedules and registration statements filed by
the Company with the SEC since December 31, 1999 (the documents referred to in
this Section 4.07(a), collectively, the "COMPANY SEC DOCUMENTS").

         (b) As of its filing date, each Company SEC Document complied as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1934 Act
or the 1933 Act, as applicable.

         (c) As of its filing date, each Company SEC Document did not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

         SECTION 4.08. Financial Statements. The audited consolidated financial
statements of the Company included in the annual reports on Form 10-K referred
to in clause (i) of Section 4.07(a) and the unaudited consolidated interim
financial statements of the Company included in the quarterly reports on Form
10-Q referred to in clause (ii) of Section 4.07(a) fairly present, in conformity
with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on
a consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of operations and cash
flows for the periods then ended (subject to normal year-end adjustments and the
absence of notes in the case of any unaudited interim financial statements).

         SECTION 4.09.  Disclosure Documents.

         (a) The proxy statement of the Company to be filed with the SEC in
connection with the Merger (the "COMPANY PROXY STATEMENT"), and any amendments
or supplements thereto, will, when filed, comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the 1934 Act. At the time the
Company Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto is first mailed
to shareholders of the Company and at the time such shareholders vote on
adoption of this Agreement, the Company Proxy Statement, as supplemented or
amended, if applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The representations and warranties contained in this Section 4.09
will not apply to statements or omissions included in the Company Proxy
Statement based upon information furnished to the Company in writing by or on
behalf of Parent or Merger Sub specifically for use therein.

         SECTION 4.10. Absence of Certain Changes. Since December 31, 1999, the

material "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), each material employment,
severance or similar contract, plan, arrangement or policy and each other
material plan or arrangement providing for compensation, bonuses,
profit-sharing, stock option or other stock related rights or other forms of
incentive or deferred compensation, vacation benefits, insurance coverage
(including, any self-insured arrangements), health or medical benefits,
disability benefits, workers' compensation, supplemental unemployment benefits,

         been determined by the IRS to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
         Code, and the Company knows of no fact or circumstance giving rise to a
         material likelihood that the plan would not be treated as so qualified
         by the IRS;




                                       18

         withdrawal liability (within the meaning of Section 4201(b) of ERISA)

         Company has no reason to believe that any such withdrawal liability
         will be incurred, (B) no notice has been received indicating that such
         Multiemployer Plan is in "reorganization" (within the meaning of
         Section 4241 of ERISA), (C) no notice has been received that increased
         contributions may be required to avoid a reduction in plan benefits or

         the Company or any ERISA Affiliate were to have a complete withdrawal
         under Section 4203 of ERISA as of the Effective Time, no withdrawal
         liability would exist on the part of the Company or any ERISA
         Affiliate;

                  (v)    no benefit under any Benefit Plan, including without
         limitation, any severance or parachute payment plan or agreement, will
         be established or become accelerated, vested or payable by reason of
         any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

                  (vi)   neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has
         incurred any liability for any tax imposed under Sections 4971 through
         4980E of the Code or civil liability under Section 502(i) or (l) of
         ERISA;

         the termination or modification as to employees or former employees of
         the Company of any Benefit Plan under which obligations to provide
         post-retirement benefits arise; and

                  (ix)   no action (excluding claims for benefits incurred in

         knowledge of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, threatened against

market value that is greater than such plan's liabilities, as determined in
accordance with applicable law using reasonable actuarial assumptions. For
purposes hereof, the term "FOREIGN PLAN" shall mean any plan, program, policy,
arrangement or agreement maintained or contributed to by, or entered into with,
the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to employees (or former employees)
employed outside the United States.

         SECTION 4.17.  Environmental Matters. (a) Except as disclosed in

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or their

Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party
conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such Party (or its
agents or advisors) in possession of confidential information about the Company

                               COVENANTS OF PARENT


         Parent agrees that:

         SECTION 7.01. Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent will take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

         SECTION 7.02. Voting of Shares. Parent agrees to vote or cause to be
voted all Shares Beneficially Owned by it, if any, in favor of adoption of this
Agreement at the Company Shareholder Meeting.

         SECTION 7.03. Director and Officer Liability. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

         (a)    For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former officer
and director of the Company and of any Subsidiary of the Company (each an
"INDEMNIFIED PERSON") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by the MBCA or provided under
the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws in effect on the date hereof;
provided that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed
from time to time under applicable law.

         (b)    The Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Person may incur in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 7.03.
The Indemnified Person shall be entitled to control the defense of any action,
suit, investigation or proceeding with counsel of its own choosing reasonably
acceptable to the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate



                                       29

<PAGE>   34


in the defense thereof, provided that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
liable for the fees of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Persons, other
than local counsel, unless a conflict of interest shall be caused thereby, and
provided further that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld).

         (c)    For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide officers' and directors' liability insurance in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each
such Indemnified Person currently covered by the Company's officers' and
directors' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and
amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof;
provided that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to make annual
premium payments for such insurance to the extent such annual premiums exceed
225% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such
insurance and provided, further, that if the premiums with respect to such
insurance exceed 225% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the
Company for such insurance, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain such insurance with the maximum coverage as can be obtained at an annual
premium equal to 225% of the annual premiums paid by the Company as of the date
hereof.

         (d)    The obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section
7.03 shall be joint and several obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation.

         (e)    If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.03.

         (f)    The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03
shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under the
MBCA or any other applicable laws. These rights shall survive consummation of
the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person.

         SECTION 7.04.  Employee Benefits after the Merger.

         (a)    For a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
December 31, 2002, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide those
of its and its Subsidiaries' employees who were employed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the completion of the Effective Time with
compensation and employee benefits substantially equivalent in the aggregate, to
the compensation and benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to
such employees immediately prior to the date hereof; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to offer
compensation and benefit plans or arrangements with employer stock as a
component.

<PAGE>   35



         (b)    Subject to Section 7.04(a), from and after the Effective Time,
Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor, without
modification, perform all acts and pay all amounts required or due under or with
respect to each Benefit Plan and each agreement which relates to any current or
former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the terms of any such
employee's employment or termination of employment, including, without
limitation, all employment, retention, change of control, employment protection,
severance, termination, consulting, deferred compensation, executive pension and
retirement, welfare and fringe benefit agreements, plans and programs, except
for any modification to any such Benefit Plan or agreement to the extent
permitted in accordance with Section 7.04(a). Nothing contained in this Section
7.04(b) shall restrict Parent or the Surviving Corporation from seeking to amend
or otherwise modify any Benefit Plan to the extent such modification is
permitted by the terms of such Plan and is consistent with Section 7.04(a).

         (c)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.04
shall preclude Parent from seeking to (i) modify any employment agreement with
the consent of the affected employee or employees or (ii) modify any Benefit
Plan to the extent such modification is permitted by the terms of such Benefit
Plan and is consistent with Section 7.04(a).

         (d)    Notwithstanding Section 7.04(a), employment of any of the
employees by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries will be "at will" and
may be terminated by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries at any time
for any reason (subject to any legally binding agreement other than this
Agreement, or any applicable laws or collective bargaining agreement, or any
other arrangement or commitment). No provision of this Section 7.04 shall confer
any third party beneficiary rights or benefits to any employee of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries under this Agreement.

         SECTION 7.05. Financing Arrangements. (a) Merger Sub shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain financing in an amount at least equal
to the Required Amount, including by executing definitive agreements for the
facilities referred to in the Commitment Letter on or prior to the Effective
Time. The Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements for the facilities
referred to therein (along with any other document pursuant to which Parent or
Merger Sub intends to obtain financing of all or a portion of the Required
Amount) are referred to herein collectively as the "Financing Agreements." The
Company will be afforded a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
representations and warranties contained in the Financing Agreements and no such
representation or warranty, insofar as it relates to facts and circumstances
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, shall be included therein that the
Company shall have advised Merger Sub is incorrect or inaccurate. Merger Sub
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the representations and
warranties contained in the Financing Agreements shall be consistent with the
Commitment Letter.



                                       31

<PAGE>   36


         (b)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event
that at any time funds are not or have not been made available under the
Financing Agreements so as to enable Merger Sub to proceed with the Merger in a
timely manner, Merger Sub shall (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain alternative funding in an amount at least equal to the Required Amount on
terms and conditions comparable to those provided in such Financing Agreements
or otherwise on terms reasonably acceptable to Merger Sub and (ii) shall
continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, nothing
contained herein shall require Merger Sub to obtain equity financing in excess
of the amount of equity financing contemplated in the Commitment Letter.

         SECTION 10.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding
any approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company):

         (a)    by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

         (b)    by either the Company or Parent, if:

                  (i)   the Merger has not been consummated on or before March
         31, 2001 (the "TERMINATION DATE"); provided that the right to terminate
         this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(b)(i) shall not be
         available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement
         results in the failure of the Merger to be consummated by such time; or

                  (ii)  there shall be any law or regulation that makes
         consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or any
         judgment, injunction, order or decree of any court or governmental body
         having competent jurisdiction enjoining the Company or Parent from
         consummating the Merger is entered and such judgment, injunction, order
         or decree shall have become final and nonappealable; provided that the
         right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(b)(ii)
         shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of
         this Agreement results in the application of any such law or regulation
         to the Merger or the imposition of any such judgment, injunction, order
         or decree; or

<PAGE>   41


                  (iii) this Agreement and the Merger shall not have been
         approved and adopted in accordance with the MBCA by the shareholders of
         the Company at the Company Shareholder Meeting (or any adjournment
         thereof); or

                  (iv)  as permitted by Section 6.04 hereof, the Board of
         Directors of the Company shall have failed to make or withdrawn or
         modified in a manner adverse to Parent its approval or recommendation
         of this Agreement or the Merger; provided that the Company may not
         terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(b)(iv) unless
         and until (i) five Business Days have elapsed following delivery to
         Parent of a written notice of such determination by the Board of
         Directors of the Company and (ii) at the end of such five Business Day
         period the Board of Directors of the Company confirms its determination
         (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failing to
         withdraw, not make or modify in a manner adverse to Parent its
         recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger would cause the
         Company's Board of Directors to be in breach of its fiduciary duties to
         the Company's shareholders under applicable law.

         (c)      by Parent if a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set
forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the condition set
forth in Section 9.02(a) hereof not to be satisfied, and such condition is
incapable of being satisfied by the Termination Date; or

         (d)      by the Company if a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger
Sub set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the
conditions set forth in Section 9.03(a) hereof not to be satisfied, and such
condition is incapable of being satisfied by the Termination Date.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01
(other than pursuant to Section 10.01(a)) shall give prompt notice of such
termination to the other party.

         SECTION 10.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 10.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect
with no liability on the part of any party (or any shareholder, director,
officer, manager, member, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such
party) to the other party hereto; provided that, if such termination shall
result from the willful (i) failure of either party to fulfill a condition to
the performance of the obligations of the other party or (ii) failure of either
party to perform a covenant hereof, such party shall be fully liable for any and
all liabilities and damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a result
of such failure. The provisions of Sections 8.04, 11.04, 11.06, 11.07 and 11.08
shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 10.01.

such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this

possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

         SECTION 11.13. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
