ARTICLE II

  



  

CONVERSION OF SHARES

  



  

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Shares_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of the common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, be
converted into one (1) fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (individually, a " _Share_ " and
collectively, the " _Shares_ ") (other than (i) Shares held by the Company,
(ii) Shares held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent and
(iii) any Dissenting Shares (as defined herein)) shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or any
holder thereof, be converted into and be exchangeable

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

for the right to receive $47, without interest, in cash (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, the Shares will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate representing such Share immediately
prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender
of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.4.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, each Share held by Parent, Merger Sub, any other
subsidiary of Parent, or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder thereof, be canceled, retired and cease to
exist and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_
"), and who complies in all respects with Section 262 (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(b), but instead such holder shall be
entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of
such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares under Section 262 shall
cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at
the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(b). The Company shall give
Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands to assert dissenters rights
that are received by the Company with respect to Shares and (ii) the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to or settle any such demands.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Stock Options_. As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, Parent and the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee of
the Company Board (as defined herein) administering the Companys Employee
Stock Option Plan, as amended, or 1993 Director Stock Option Plan
(collectively, the " _Company Option Plans_ ")) shall take such action as may
be required to effect the following provisions of this Section 2.2.  As of
the Effective Time each option to purchase Shares pursuant to the Company
Option Plans (each a " _Company Stock Option_ ") which is then outstanding
and has not been exercised shall (whether or not fully vested), by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or
any holder thereof, be converted into and exchangeable for the right to
receive an

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

amount equal to the Merger Consideration in cash, less an amount equal to (a)
the exercise price for such Company Stock Option plus (b) any applicable tax
withholding amounts. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any Company
Stock Option with respect to which the applicable exercise price is greater
than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall be fully exercisable prior to
the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the Company Option Plans,
and any such Company Stock Option that is not exercised prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay the cash consideration to be paid for the Company Stock
Options, via check, as promptly as practicable but, in any event, within ten
(10) business days after the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 2.3 _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of
exchanging Shares for the Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").
Substantially concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of Shares, the cash
payable pursuant to Section 2.1(b) in exchange for outstanding Shares. The
cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_."

  



  

Section 2.4 _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of a certificate or certificates which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") (a) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that
delivery shall be effective, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and
which letter shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify; and (b) instructions for effecting the
surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
 Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in the amount equal to the
cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable
upon the surrender of the Certificates. If payment is made to a person other
than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it
will be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such payment shall (i) pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person
other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or (ii)
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable.

  



  

Section 2.5 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash
paid upon conversion of the Shares in accordance with the terms of Article I
and this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the Shares.

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

Section 2.6 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for one (1) year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or
otherwise on the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of
the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for the Merger
Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented thereby to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and Section 2.4.
Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of
Shares five (5) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become subject to the abandoned property Law of any Governmental Entity (as
defined herein)) shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property
of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

Section 2.7 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  



  

Section 2.8 _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a
daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall promptly be paid to Parent.

  



  

Section 2.9 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in the form
reasonably required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable
Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented thereby.

  



  

Section 2.10 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of a Tax (as defined herein) Law. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Shares in respect to which such deduction and withholding were made by
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

  



  

Section 2.11 _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the
Company. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent or Parent

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration with respect
to the Shares formerly represented thereby.

  



  

ARTICLE III

  



  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  



  

Except as set forth in (a) the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date
hereof or (b) the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent
prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_
") (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered
representation and warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

  



  

Section 3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.

  



  

(a) The Company and each of its subsidiaries is a corporation or legal entity
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the jurisdiction of its organization and has all requisite corporate,
partnership or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now conducted and proposed by the
Company to be conducted.

  



  

(b) Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
all subsidiaries of the Company. The Company does not own, directly or

security of any other entity or any other investment in any other entity.

  



  

(c) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed
and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where
the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing does not
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(d) The Company has heretofore made available or delivered to Parent accurate
and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other
similar governing instruments), as currently in effect, of the Company and
each of its material subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 3.2 _Capitalization of the Company and Its Subsidiaries_.

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of: (i) 120,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock, of which 29,491,749 shares were issued and
outstanding and no shares of which were held in the Companys treasury, each
as of the close of business on October 29, 2004; (ii) 85 shares of redeemable

6   

     
   

  



  

outstanding Shares have been validly issued and are duly authorized, fully
paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive rights. As of November 1, 2004,
1,324,549 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance
and issuable upon or otherwise deliverable in connection with the exercise

stock have been issued other than pursuant to Company Stock Options already
in existence on such date, (b) no Company Stock Options have been granted and
(c) there has been no declaration or payment of any dividend or other

Except as set forth above, as of the date hereof, there are outstanding (i)

securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company;
(iii) no options or other rights to acquire from the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, and no obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
issue, any capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for capital stock or voting securities of the Company; and (iv)
no equity equivalents, interests in the ownership or earnings of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries or other similar rights (including stock
appreciation rights) (collectively, " _Company Securities_ ").  There are no
outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company Securities. There are no
stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or understandings
to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party relating to the
voting of any shares of capital stock of the Company. Section 3.2(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth information regarding the
current exercise price, date of grant and number granted of Company Stock
Options for each holder thereof.

  



  

(b) All of the outstanding capital stock of the Companys subsidiaries is
owned by the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien (as
defined herein), other than Permitted Exceptions, or any other limitation
or restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote or sell the
same, except as may be provided as a matter of Law).  There are no
securities of the Company or its subsidiaries convertible into or
exchangeable for, no options or other rights to acquire from the Company or
its subsidiaries, and no other contract, understanding, arrangement or
obligation (whether or not contingent) providing for the issuance or
sale, directly or indirectly of, any capital stock or other ownership
interests in, or any other securities of, any subsidiary of the Company.
There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or its
subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding
shares of capital stock or other ownership interests in any subsidiary of the
Company.  For purposes of this Agreement, " _Lien_ " means any mortgage,
lien, claim, pledge, charge, limitation on the Companys or any subsidiary of
the Companys voting rights, security interest or other adverse encumbrance
of any kind or nature whatsoever. There are no outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company or any of the Companys subsidiaries to provide
funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution
or otherwise) in, any subsidiary of the Company that is not wholly owned by
the Company or to or in any other person.

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

Section 3.3 _Authority Relative to This Agreement; Consents and Approvals_.

  



  

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. No other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to the Merger and this
Agreement, the Company Requisite Vote (as defined herein)). This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the
due and valid authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub,
constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting
creditors rights generally and general principles of equity.

  



  

(b) The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has duly
and validly authorized the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
approved the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, and has resolved (i) to deem this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, taken together, advisable and fair
to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders and (ii)
to recommend that the stockholders of the Company approve and adopt this
Agreement. The Company Board has directed that this Agreement be submitted to
the stockholders of the Company for their approval. The affirmative approval
of the holders of Shares representing a majority of the votes that are
entitled to be cast by the holders of all outstanding Shares (voting as a
single class) as of the record date for the Company (the " _Company Requisite
Vote_ ") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of capital
stock of the Company necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

  



  

Section 3.4 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_. The Company has filed all
required forms, statements, reports and documents with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since January 1, 2003 (each, a " _Company
SEC Report_ ," collectively, the " _Company SEC Reports_ "), each of which
has complied in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933 (the " _Act_ "), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the " _Exchange Act_ "), or both, as the case may be, each as in effect on
the dates such Company SEC Reports were filed. Except as and to the extent
amended, modified, restated or revised in any subsequent Company SEC Report
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, none of the Company SEC Reports,
including any financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by
reference therein, contained, when filed, any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or
incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The financial statements of the Company, including all
related notes and schedules, contained in the Company SEC Reports (the "
_Company Financial Statements_ ") complied as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto,

  



  

8   

     
   

  



  

have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and
fairly present (on a consolidated basis, if applicable) (i) the financial
position of the Company as of the dates thereof, and (ii) its results of
operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders equity for the periods
then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial
statements, to normal year-end adjustments). Since December 31, 2003 (the "
_Audit Date_ "), there has not been any material change, or any application
or request for any material change, by the Company in accounting principles,
methods or policies for financial accounting or Tax purposes (subject, in the
case of the unaudited interim financial statements, to normal year-end
adjustments).

  



  

Section 3.5 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as and to the extent
publicly disclosed by the Company in the Company SEC Reports (including the
Company Financial Statements) filed prior to the date of this Agreement or as
incurred in the ordinary course of business since the Audit Date, none of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, and whether due
or to become due or asserted or unasserted, whether or not required by GAAP
to be reflected in, reserved against or otherwise described in the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (in each
case including the notes thereto), which have or would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of
this Agreement, there are no related-party transactions or off-balance sheet
structures or transactions with respect to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries that would be required to be reported or set forth therein
pursuant to the Exchange Act or the rules promulgated by the SEC thereunder.

  



  

Section 3.6 _Absence of Changes_. Except as and to the extent publicly
disclosed by the Company in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date
of this Agreement, since the Audit Date, the business of the Company and each
of its subsidiaries has been carried on only in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice, and none of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries has incurred any liabilities of any nature, whether or
not accrued, contingent or otherwise, which do or which would reasonably
be expected to have, and there have been no events, changes or effects
with respect to the Company or its subsidiaries which do or which would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 3.7 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_.

  



  

(a) Except for such filings, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals
as may be required by or under, and other applicable requirements of, the
Act, the Exchange Act, state securities or blue sky Laws, the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "),
the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), any Gaming Authority, in
connection with any liquor licenses held by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, such filings, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals
relating or applicable to Parent or any of its subsidiaries and not the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, the filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger as

  



  

9   

     
   

  



  

required by the DGCL or as otherwise set forth in Sections 3.7(a) or (b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, no filing with or notice to, and no permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any court or tribunal or
administrative, legislative, governmental or regulatory body, agency or
authority, including any Gaming Authority (a " _Governmental Entity_ "), is
necessary for the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement or
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby,
except where the failure to obtain such permits, authorizations, consents or
approvals or to make such filings or give such notice would not and would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, (i) materially
impair, materially delay or prevent the performance of this Agreement or the
Merger or (ii) materially impair the ability of the Surviving Corporation and
its subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses in a substantially
similar manner as conducted by the Company and the Companys subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby will (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the
respective certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws (or similar
governing documents) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) result
in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or
lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
amendment, cancellation or acceleration or Lien (other than Permitted
Exceptions)) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other
instrument or obligation (collectively, " _Contracts_ ") to which the Company
or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) assuming compliance
with the matters referred to in Section 3.7(a), violate any Law (including
any Gaming Law) applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties or assets or any Company Permit (as defined
herein), except in the case of (ii) or (iii) for violations, breaches or
defaults which do not or would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 3.8 _Property_.

  



  

(a) Section 3.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth all of the
material real property owned in fee by the Company and its subsidiaries. Each
of the Company and its subsidiaries has good and marketable title to each
parcel of real property owned by it, free and clear of all Liens, other than
Permitted Exceptions.

  



  

(b) Section 3.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth all material
leases, subleases and other agreements (the " _Real Property Leases_ ") under
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries uses or occupies or has the
right to use or occupy, now or in the future, any real property. Except as
would not be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
each Real Property Lease constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation
of the Company or its subsidiary that is a party thereto, as the case may be,
enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be

10   

     
   

  



  

moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity principles)
and is in full force and effect. Except as would not be reasonably expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, all rents and other sums and
charges payable by the Company and its subsidiaries as tenants under the Real
Property Leases are materially current and no termination event or condition
or uncured default of a material nature on the part of the Company or any
such subsidiary or, to the Companys knowledge, the landlord, exists under
any Real Property Lease. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has a good
and valid leasehold interest in each parcel of material real property leased
by it, free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Exceptions.

  



  

(c) No party to any Real Property Lease has refused to grant a material
consent thereunder within the twelve (12) months prior to the date of
this Agreement. No party to any Real Property Lease has given written notice
to the Company or any of its subsidiaries of, or made a claim against the
Company or any of its subsidiaries with respect to, any breach or default
thereunder, in any such case in which such breach or default does or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(d) The Company and each of its subsidiaries have good and valid title to
each riverboat gaming property owned by it, free and clear of all Liens,
other than Permitted Exceptions. This paragraph (d) does not relate to real

paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 3.8.

  



  

Section 3.9 _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in any of the Company
SEC Reports filed after January 1, 2004 but prior to the date of this
Agreement, there is no claim, action, proceeding or, to the Companys
knowledge, investigation (collectively, " _Claim_ ") pending or, to the
Companys knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, including by or
before any Governmental Entity, which (a) does or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect or (b) as of the date hereof, questions the validity of this
Agreement or any action to be taken by the Company in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or could otherwise
prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  Except as disclosed in any of the Company SEC Reports filed
after January 1, 2004 but prior to the date of this Agreement, none of the
Company or its subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, writ,
injunction or decree which does or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 3.10 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. The Company and its
subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders
and approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary for the lawful conduct
of their respective businesses (the " _Company Permits_ "), except for
failures to hold such permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and
approvals which do not or would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The

  



  

11   

     
   

  



  

Company and its subsidiaries and each of their respective "key persons" (as
defined under applicable Gaming Law) are in compliance with the terms of the
Company Permits, except where the failure to so comply does not or would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The businesses of the Company and its
subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of any foreign or domestic
law, order, writ, injunction, decree, ordinance, award, stipulation, statute,
compact with any tribe, judicial or administrative doctrine, rule or
regulation entered by a Governmental Entity including any Gaming Law (" _Law_
") applicable to the Company or its subsidiaries, except for violations or
possible violations which do not and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
 To the Companys knowledge, no investigation or review by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Company or its subsidiaries is pending or
threatened, nor, to the Companys knowledge, has any Governmental
Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same, other than, in each case,
those which do not or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 3.11 _Employee Plans_.

  



  

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list, as of the date hereof, of all material "employee benefit
plans," as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employment Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), all material employment,
severance, individual consulting, individual compensation or similar
agreements, and all material bonus, profit sharing or other incentive
compensation, executive compensation, stock option or other stock-related
rights, deferred compensation, stock purchase, vacation pay, salary
continuation, hospitalization, medical or other health benefits, life
insurance or other insurance coverage, workers compensation, supplemental
unemployment benefits, retirement benefit, retiree welfare benefit coverage,
scholarship or other educational assistance, or similar agreements (in each
case, whether written or unwritten) for which the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate has any obligation or liability (contingent or otherwise) with
respect to any current or former employee or current or former director of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries (each an " _Employee Benefit Plan_ "
and collectively, the " _Employee Benefit Plans_ "). For purposes of this
Agreement, " _ERISA Affiliate_ " means any person that, together with the
Company, would be treated as a single employer under Section 414 of the Code
or Section 4001 of ERISA and any general partnership of which the Company is
or has been a general partner. None of the Employee Benefit Plans is a
multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA ("
_Multiemployer Plan_ "), or is or has been subject to Sections 4063 or 4064
of ERISA (" _Multiple Employer Plans_ "), and neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate contributes to or has any liability under any Multiemployer
Plan.

  



  

(b) True, correct and complete copies of the following documents, to the
extent such documents are applicable with respect to each of the Employee
Benefit Plans (other than a Multiemployer Plan) have been made available or
delivered to Parent by the Company: (i) any plans and related trust
documents, and amendments thereto; (ii) the most recent Forms 5500 and
schedules thereto; (iii) the most

  



  

12   

     
   

  



  

recent Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") determination letter; (iv) the
most recent financial statements and actuarial valuations prepared for such
Employee Benefit Plans, if applicable; and (v) the most recent summary plan
descriptions.

  



  

(c) To the knowledge of the Company, except as would not be reasonably
likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect: (i) all material payments required to be made by or under any
Employee Benefit Plan, any related trusts, or any collective bargaining
agreement or pursuant to Law have been made by the due date thereof
(including any valid extension); (ii) the Company and its ERISA Affiliates
have timely performed in all material respects all obligations required to be
performed by them under any Employee Benefit Plan; (iii) the Employee Benefit
Plans have been administered in compliance with their terms and the
requirements of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws; (iv) there are no
actions, suits, arbitrations or claims (other than routine claims for
benefit) pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened with respect to
any Employee Benefit Plan; and (v) the Company and its ERISA Affiliates have
no liability as a result of any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code) for any excise Tax or
civil penalty.

  



  

(d) None of the Employee Benefit Plans is subject to Title IV of ERISA.
Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any liability under Title IV
of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate or any organization to
which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate is a successor or parent
corporation, within the meaning of Section 4069(b) of ERISA, has engaged in
any transaction within the last five (5) years described in Section 4069 of
ERISA.

  



  

(e) To the knowledge of the Company, each of the Employee Benefit Plans which
is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the
Code has been determined by the IRS to be so "qualified" and the trusts
maintained pursuant thereto are exempt from federal income taxation under
Section 501 of the Code, and the Company knows of no fact which would
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Employee Benefit Plan or
the exemption of such trust in each case, in a manner that would be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(f) Except as required by other applicable Law, none of the Employee Benefit
Plans provides for continuing retiree health, retiree medical or retiree
life insurance coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a
participant.

  



  

(g) No stock or other security issued by the Company forms or has formed a
material part of the assets of any Employee Benefit Plan. There are no
outstanding restricted shares issued by the Company.

  



  

(h) Except as contemplated by this Agreement, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will by itself or in combination with any other event:
(i) result in any bonus, retirement, severance or other payment becoming due,
or increase the amount

  



  

13   

     
   

  



  

of compensation due, to any current or former employee of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries; (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
Employee Benefit Plan; (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of
payment or vesting of any such material benefits; or (iv) result in any job
security or similar benefit or increased such benefit.

  



  

(i) Other than de minimis amounts, there would be no amounts payable under
any contract, plan or arrangement (written or otherwise) covering any
employee or former employee of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates
that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Sections 162(m) or 280G
of the Code.

  



  

(j) The Company and its ERISA Affiliates do not maintain, sponsor or have any
liability (contingent or otherwise) with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan
outside the United States.

individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(d) There are no complaints, charges or claims against the Company or any of
its subsidiaries pending, or threatened in writing to be brought or filed,

Closing, possess all permits, authorizations, consents and approvals required

Section 3.14 _Tax Matters._

(within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code) of which the Company or any
of its subsidiaries is or has been a member, have timely filed all federal
income Tax Returns (as defined herein) and all other Tax Returns required to
be filed by them, after giving effect to all extensions permitted by
applicable Law. All such Tax Returns are complete and correct in all material
respects. The Company and each of its subsidiaries have paid (or the Company
has paid on its subsidiaries behalf) all material Taxes shown as due on such
Tax Returns. The most recent consolidated financial statements contained in
the Company SEC Reports reflect an adequate reserve for all Taxes payable by
the Company and its subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof
through the date of such financial statements, other than for any Taxes the
amount or validity of which are being contested or disputed in good faith.
There are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable and
Permitted Exceptions) upon any of the assets of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Tax_ " or " _Taxes_ " shall
mean all taxes, charges, fees, imposts, levies or other assessments,

declaration or any other information or filing required to be supplied to any
taxing authority or jurisdiction (foreign or domestic) with respect to Taxes,
including, without limitation, information returns, any document with respect
to or accompanying payments or estimated Taxes, or with respect to or
accompanying requests for the extension of time in which to file any such

proceedings, investigations, claims or administrative or other proceedings
relating to Taxes or any Tax Returns of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries now pending. To the knowledge of the Company (which,
for purposes of this Section 3.14, shall include the actual knowledge of
the Companys tax manager), no material deficiencies or claims for any Taxes
have been proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company or any of

recognized accounting firm with respect to any matter for which the amount of
Taxes in question exceeds $250,000 for any taxable period with respect to
which the applicable statute of limitations has not yet expired (taking into
account any applicable extensions).

(a) The Company has heretofore made available to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of all written Contracts (and all material amendments,
modifications and supplements thereto and all side letters to which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party affecting the obligations of
any party thereunder) to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a
party or by which any of its properties or

  



  

17   

     
   

  



  

assets are bound that are either filed (including through incorporation by
reference) as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal

date hereof; and (x) commitments and agreements to enter into any of the
foregoing (collectively, the " _Material Contracts_ ").

  



  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, each of the Material Contracts constitutes the valid and
legally binding obligation of the Company or its subsidiaries, enforceable in
accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights or by general equity principles). There is no
default under any Material Contract so listed either by the Company or, to
the Companys knowledge, by any other party thereto, and no event has
occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would
constitute a default thereunder by the Company or, to the Companys
knowledge, any other party, in any such case in which such default or event
does or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

other valid rights to use (in each case, free and clear of any Liens (other

connection with the business of the Company and its subsidiaries as currently
conducted other than as would not be reasonably expected to have,
individually or on the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(c) To the Companys knowledge, the use by the Company of any Intellectual
Property owned by the Company and its subsidiaries does not infringe upon or
otherwise violate the rights of any person other than as would not reasonably

otherwise violating any right of the Company or any of its subsidiaries with
respect to, and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has made any

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any written
notice of any assertion or claim, pending or not, with respect to any
Intellectual Property used by the Company or its subsidiaries other than as
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(g) To the Companys knowledge, no Intellectual Property owned by and/or
licensed to the Company or its subsidiaries is being used or enforced in a
manner that would result in the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability
of such Intellectual Property other than as would not reasonably be expected

good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the property

  



  

20

Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 4.2 _Authority Relative to This Agreement_.

  



  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. No other corporate proceedings on the part
of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and,
assuming the due and valid authorization, execution and delivery hereof by
the Company, constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of each of
Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally and general principles of equity.

  



  

(b) The Boards of Directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ ") and Merger Sub
and Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub have duly and validly
authorized the execution and delivery of this Agreement and approved the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 4.3 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Except for such
filings, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as may be required
by or under, and other applicable requirements of, the Act, the Exchange Act,
state securities or blue sky Laws, the HSR Act, the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.
(" _Nasdaq_ "), any Gaming Authority, such filings, permits, authorization,
consents and approvals relating or applicable to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries and not Parent or any of its subsidiaries, the filing and
recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL, no
filing with or notice to, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval
of, any Governmental Entity is necessary for the execution and delivery by
Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement or the consummation by Parent or
Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, except where the failure
to obtain such permits, authorizations, consents or approvals or to make such
filings or give such notice would not and would not reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair, materially delay or
prevent the performance of this Agreement or the Merger.  Neither the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub
nor the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
hereby will (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the
respective articles of incorporation or bylaws (or similar governing
documents) of Parent or Merger Sub or any of Parents subsidiaries, (ii)
result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice
or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of
termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration or Lien (other than
Permitted Exceptions)) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub or any of Parents subsidiaries is
a party or by which any of them or

  



  

21   

     
   

  



  

any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) violate
any Law (including any Gaming Law) applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or any
of Parents subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets,
except in the case of (ii) or (iii) for violations, breaches or defaults
which do not or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 4.4 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.  Parent and each of its
subsidiaries that files forms, reports and documents with the SEC have filed
all required forms, statements, reports and documents with the SEC since the
later of January 1, 2003 or the date on which any such filing obligation
arose (each, a " _Parent SEC Report_ " and collectively, the " _Parent SEC
Reports_ "), each of which has complied in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of the Act, the Exchange Act, or both, as the case
may be, each as in effect on the dates such Parent SEC Reports were filed.
Except as and to the extent amended, modified, restated or revised in any
subsequent Parent SEC Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement, none
of the Parent SEC Reports, including any financial statements or schedules
included or incorporated by reference therein, contained, when filed, any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The financial statements of Parent and
its subsidiaries, including all related notes and schedules, contained in the
Parent SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto), and fairly present (on a consolidated basis,
if applicable) (i) the financial position of Parent or its subsidiary
providing the financial statements, as applicable, as of the dates thereof,
and (ii) its results of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders
equity for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).  Since the
Audit Date, there has not been any material change, or any application or
request for any material change, by Parent or any of its subsidiaries, in
accounting principles, methods or policies for financial accounting or Tax
purposes (subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements,
to normal year-end adjustments).

  



  

Section 4.5 _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in any of the Parent
SEC Reports filed after January 1, 2004 but prior to the date of this
Agreement, there is no Claim pending or, to Parents knowledge, threatened
against Parent or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets, including by or before any Governmental Entity, which
(a) does or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (b) as of the date hereof,
questions the validity of this Agreement or any action to be taken by the
Company in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or could otherwise prevent or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

22   

     
   

  



  

Section 4.6 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Parent and its subsidiaries
hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of
all Governmental Entities necessary for the lawful conduct of their
respective businesses (the " _Parent Permits_ "), except for failures to hold
such permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals which do
not or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and its subsidiaries and
each of their respective "key persons" (as defined under applicable Gaming
Law) are in compliance with the terms of the Parent Permits, except where the
failure to so comply does not or would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The
businesses of Parent and its subsidiaries are not being conducted in
violation of any Law applicable to Parent or its subsidiaries, except for
violations or possible violations which do not and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. To Parents knowledge, no investigation or review by any Governmental
Entity with respect to Parent or its subsidiaries is pending or threatened,
nor, to Parents knowledge, has any Governmental Entity indicated an
intention to conduct the same, other than, in each case, those which Parent
reasonably believes do not or would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 4.7 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than
Bear, Stearns and Co. Inc. and Goldman, Sachs and Co.) is entitled to any
brokerage, finders or other advisory fee or commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by and on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their affiliates.

  



  

Section 4.8 _Financing_. Parent has obtained a written commitment (the "
_Commitment Letter_ ") from Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas,
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc., Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., Lehman
Brothers Inc. and Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. (collectively, the "
_Financing Sources_ ") to provide financing in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, a true and correct
copy of which has been provided by Parent to the Company. As of the date of
this Agreement, the Commitment Letter has not been amended and is in full
force and effect. As of the date of this Agreement and other than as may be
deemed to exist as a result of Parents rights set forth in Section 6.17(b),
Parent does not know of any facts that would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, materially impair, materially delay or
prevent the consummation of the financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter or that would cause the funds to be provided by the Financing Sources
under the Commitment Letter to be insufficient to fund Parents and Merger
Subs obligations under this Agreement or as otherwise required or
contemplated by or under the Commitment Letter.

Section 6.5 _Efforts; Cooperation._

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Financing), including, without limitation, to (i) obtain from
Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations or orders required to be obtained or made by Parent or the
Company or any of their subsidiaries in connection with the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the Financing), and
(ii) make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other submissions
either required or deemed appropriate by each of the parties, with respect to
this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Financing) required under (A) the Act, the Exchange Act, any
other applicable federal or state securities or blue sky Laws, (B) the HSR
Act, (C) the DGCL, (D) any other applicable Law, (E) any Gaming Laws
applicable to such party and (F) the rules and regulations of the NYSE and/or
Nasdaq. The parties hereto shall cooperate and consult with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings, including by providing copies
of all such documents to the nonfiling party and its advisors prior to
filing, and, except as required by Law, none of the parties will file any
such document if any of the other parties shall have reasonably objected to
the filing of such document. No party to this Agreement shall consent to any
voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to
any voluntary delay of the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby at the behest of any Governmental Entity
without the consent and agreement of the other parties to this Agreement,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable and to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, as promptly as practicable all other actions consistent with
this Section 6.5 necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.5(a), each of Parent and the
Company shall (i) cooperate in all material respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party; and (ii) keep the other party promptly informed in all
material respects of any material communication

  



  

29   

     
   

  



  

received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any other
Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all
other Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

  



  

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.5(a), each of Parent and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly and
expeditiously as practicable, (i) file all required applications for Parent
and all "key persons" (as defined under applicable Gaming Laws) to obtain the
necessary approvals from all applicable Gaming Authorities in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Financing);
and (ii) request an accelerated review from such Gaming Authorities in
connection with such filings.

  



  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 6.5(a), (b) and (c), each of Parent and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as
may be asserted by a Governmental Entity or other person with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or Gaming Law or by
any Gaming Authority.  In connection with the foregoing, if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by
a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging
any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust
Law, Gaming Law or the rules and regulations of any Gaming Authority, each of
Parent and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and
use its respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable,
contest and resist any such action or proceeding, to limit the scope or
effect of any proposed action of, or remedy sought to be obtained or imposed
by, any Gaming Authority, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.5 shall (i) limit a partys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII so long as such party has
up to then complied in all material respects with its obligations under this
Section 6.5, or (ii) require Parent to (A) dispose of or hold separate any
part of its or the Companys businesses or operations (or a combination of
Parents and the Companys businesses or operations), (B) agree not to
compete in any geographic area or line of business or (C) remove or replace
any "key person" (as defined under applicable Gaming Laws), except that
Parent shall be required in furtherance of its obligations to take, or commit
to take, the actions referred to in this clause (ii) and any other actions to
the extent that doing so would not have, or be reasonably likely to have, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.  For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
acknowledge and agree that any trust arrangement that may be required by a
Gaming Authority as a result of the potential holding of multiple licenses by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective

  



  

30   

     
   

  



  

subsidiaries following the Effective Time shall not in and of itself be
deemed to constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Company will
cooperate in taking any action required to be taken by any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
that is within its control and that Parent reasonably requests the Company to
take so long as the effectiveness of such action is conditioned on the
consummation of the Merger; _provided_ that the Company shall not be required
to take any actions that, individually or in the aggregate, would in the
reasonable judgment of the Company result in a negative impact on the
business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries if the Merger is not
consummated.

  



  

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.5(a), the Company shall not
enter into any material consensual restriction (including any consensual
encumbrance on any of its assets) that would be violated by the financing

prohibit the Company or its subsidiaries from entering into the guarantees or
granting the Liens on their respective assets contemplated thereby (other
than any restrictions or encumbrances relating to the Existing Target
Facilities (as defined in the Commitment Letter) or the Existing Target Notes
(as defined in the Commitment Letter) or any other indebtedness of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries to be repaid in conjunction with
the Transaction (as defined in the Commitment Letter) as contemplated by
the Commitment Letter), and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts

efforts to notify Parent of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the
occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would be likely to cause
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which is qualified
as to materiality to be untrue or inaccurate, or any representation or
warranty not so qualified to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect,
at or prior to the Effective Time. All out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with their respective
obligations pursuant to this Section 6.5(e) shall be borne (or reimbursed
promptly following demand therefor) by Parent. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that no representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
of the Company contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate or breached or
deemed inaccurate or breached, and no condition shall be deemed not
satisfied, as a result (in whole or in part) of any action

act on its behalf in connection with the Financing), (v) require the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, or any officer, director, employee, counsel or
adviser thereof, to make any representation or warranty, incur any
liability or provide for any indemnification or expense reimbursement in
connection with the Financing prior to the Effective Time, (vi) require the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to take any action that, individually or
in the aggregate would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a
violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of
time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination, amendment,
cancellation or acceleration or Lien) under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Contract to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is
party or by which any of them or any of their respective properties or assets
is bound, (vii) require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to take any

any information or data relating to the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company for the purposes of making, or take any other action to facilitate,
any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal; or (iii) agree to, approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal;
provided, however, that, subject to the Companys compliance with this
Section 6.6, nothing contained in this Section 6.6 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from, prior to
receipt of the Company Requisite Vote, (A) entering into a definitive
agreement providing for the implementation of a Superior Proposal if the
Company or the Company Board is concurrently terminating this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.3(a), (B) furnishing non-public information to,
entering into customary confidentiality agreements with, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, any person or entity in connection with an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to the Company or its
stockholders, if the Company Board determines in its good faith reasonable
judgment after consultation with the Company Financial Advisor or other
nationally-recognized independent financial advisors that such Acquisition
Proposal, if accepted, constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to or
result in, a Superior Proposal, (C) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position with respect to such Acquisition Proposal contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any disclosure to its
stockholders, or (D) taking any nonappealable, final action ordered to

will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and will promptly inform the individuals
or entities referred to in the first sentence of this Section 6.6(a) of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 6.6.

  



  

(b) The Company shall (i) promptly (and in any event no later than forty-
eight (48) hours after receipt by the Company Board or a senior executive
officer of the Company) notify Parent orally and in writing after receipt by
the Company (or its advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries
indicating that any person is considering making or wishes to make, or which
may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, including the

it, (ii) promptly (and in any event no later than forty-eight (48) hours
after receipt by the Company Board or a senior executive officer of the
Company) notify Parent orally and in writing after receipt of any request for

any of its subsidiaries properties, books or records by any person that, to
the Companys knowledge, may be considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) receive from any person that may make or has
made an Acquisition Proposal and that requests non-public information
relating to the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries, an executed
confidentiality letter in reasonably customary form and containing terms that
are as stringent in all material respects as those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement prior to delivery of any such non-public
information. Oral notice shall be deemed given by making a telephone call to
Thomas H. Kennedy at (212) 735-2526 and speaking with him directly or leaving

required by any applicable Gaming Authority, Governmental Entity or Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules and regulations
of the NYSE or Nasdaq, as determined by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as
the case may be, in which case the issuing party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to consult with the other parties before issuing any such
release or making any such public statement. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Company will not publicly disclose any guidance concerning the expected
earnings or other performance of the Company or any of its subsidiaries;
provided, however, that (i) the Company shall publicly disclose that it is no

required or advisable under applicable Law and (ii) the Company shall
otherwise be permitted to communicate with the financial markets (including

affirmation and undertaking required by applicable Law, (ii) Parent will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) any determination
required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct
complies with the standards set forth under applicable Law and Parents

mutually acceptable to Parent and the Indemnified Party; provided, however,
that Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

policy of directors and officers liability insurance providing tail

amount provided by the Companys policy that was effective on October 29,
2004) that can be obtained for the payment of an aggregate premium cost to
Parent not greater than three hundred fifty percent (350%) of the annual
premium payable by the Company for its directors and officers liability
insurance that was effective as of October 29, 2004, the amount of coverage
and term of such policy to be advised by the Company to Parent.

  



  

(c) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 6.8.

  



  

(d) To the fullest extent permitted by Law, from and after the Effective
Time, all rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing

obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as of the Effective
Time under the provisions of all employment, bonus, consulting, termination,
severance, change in control, collective bargaining agreements, and
indemnification agreements between and among the Company or any of its
subsidiaries and any current or former officer, director, consultant or
employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; provided, however, that
this Section 6.9 shall not be construed to limit Parents or the Surviving
Corporations ability to amend or terminate any such agreement to the extent
permitted by Law and the terms of each such agreement.

  



  

(b) Following the Effective Time and for a period of twelve (12) months
thereafter, Parent shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, to all individuals who are employees of the Company at the Effective
Time and whose employment will continue following the Effective Time (the "
_Assumed Employees_ ") with base salary and bonus opportunity no less
favorable than that in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (i)
employee benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, as Parent
provides to similarly-situated employees of Parent; (ii) benefits that are no
less favorable, in the aggregate, to those of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time; or (iii) a combination of clauses
(i) and (ii); provided that such employee benefits are no less favorable, in
the aggregate, than those in effect for the Assumed Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time.  Following the Effective Time, each Assumed
Employee shall receive service credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting (but not for benefit accrual purposes) for all
periods of employment with the Company and its Affiliates and predecessors
thereto prior to the Effective Time under any employee benefit plan of Parent
or its Affiliates in which such employee is eligible to participate after the
Effective Time, to the extent such credit was given under the corresponding
Employee Benefit Plan. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary,
none of the provisions contained herein shall operate to duplicate any
benefit provided to any Assumed Employee or the funding of any such benefit.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause all (A) pre-existing
conditions and proof of insurability provisions, for all conditions covered
by Parents plan in which Assumed Employees participate that such Assumed
Employees and their covered dependents have as of the Effective Time, and (B)

hired employees to be waived in the case of clause (A) and clause (B) with
respect to Assumed Employees to the same extent waived or satisfied under the
Employee Benefit Plans. Parent or the Surviving Corporation will cause any
eligible expenses incurred by an Assumed Employee and his or her covered

  



  

36   

     
   

  



  

dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Employee Benefit Plan
ending on the date such employees participation in such plan ended to be
accounted for in the corresponding new or existing employee benefit plan of
Parent or its Affiliates for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
employee and/or his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as
if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such new or existing
employee benefit plan.

  



  

(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will give each Assumed Employee
credit, for purposes of Parents and the Surviving Corporations vacation
and/or other paid leave benefit programs, for such employees accrued and
unpaid vacation and/or paid leave balance as of the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) confer upon any
Assumed Employee any right to continued employment after the Effective Time
or (ii) prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from reserving the right
to amend, modify or terminate any of their respective benefit plans.

  



  

(e) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the severance benefits
described in the following sentence to be provided to any Assumed Employee
who would have been eligible for severance benefits under the Companys
Corporate and Key Employee Severance Plan or the Alton Belle Casino Reduction
in Force or Job Elimination Salary and Benefits Continuation, in accordance
with the terms of such plans as of the date of this Agreement, if such
Assumed Employee has a qualifying termination during the twelve-month period
following the Effective Time. The severance benefits provided shall be
no less favorable than those currently provided to a similarly situated
employee under such plans. Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, the
Company shall not designate any additional individuals as Key Employees under
the Corporate and Key Employee Severance Plan after the execution of this
Agreement, except with respect to individual employees hired after the date
hereof.

  



  

(f) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause to be paid to any
individual who is an employee of the Company as of the Effective Time and
ceases to be an employee of Parent or any of its subsidiaries within twelve
months following the Effective Time, to the extent not paid as of the date
such individual ceased to be so employed, (i) such individuals full bonus
under the Companys annual cash bonus plan for the preceding fiscal year and
(ii) if the Effective Time occurs on or after April 1, 2005 and
such individual ceased to be so employed because such individual was
terminated by Parent or any of its subsidiaries, a pro rata portion of such
individuals target bonus under the Companys annual cash bonus plan for the
fiscal year in which such individual was terminated.

  



  

(g) As of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause
to be paid to each employee who is a participant in the Companys Long Term
Incentive Cash Award Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, the pro
rata portion of such employees LTI Cash Award under the Long Term Incentive
Cash Award Plan. The index calculation with respect to each LTI Cash Award
will be

  



  

37   

     
   

  



  

determined using the Merger Consideration in lieu of the stock closing price
as provided under the Long Term Incentive Cash Award Plan.

Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
preparation, filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement and the
solicitation of stockholder approvals and all other matters related to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 6.13 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent will take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub (i) to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement and (ii) not to conduct any business prior to the
Effective Time other than in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII

  



  

TERMINATION; AMENDMENT; WAIVER

  



  

Section 8.1 _Termination by Mutual Agreement_. This Agreement may be
terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after the approval of the Merger by the
Company Requisite Vote referred to in Section 7.1(a), by mutual written
consent of the Company and Parent by action of their respective Boards of
Directors.

  



  

Section 8.2 _Termination by Either Parent or the Company_.  This Agreement
may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Effective Time by action of the Board of Directors of either Parent or the
Company if:

  



  

(a) the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before November 3, 2005,
whether such date is before or after the date of approval of the Merger by
the Company Requisite Vote (as may be extended as hereinafter provided, the "
_Termination Date_ "); provided, however, that if either Parent or the
Company determines that additional time is necessary in connection with
obtaining any consent, registration, approval, permit or authorization
required to be obtained from any Gaming Authority, or in order to comply with
the terms of any such consent, registration, approval, permit or

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

authorization to the extent that such compliance is required to occur prior
to the Effective Time, the Termination Date may be extended by Parent or the
Company from time to time by written notice to the other party to a date not
beyond December 31, 2005;

  



  

(b) the Company Requisite Vote shall not have been obtained at the Company
Stockholder Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;

  



  

(c) any Law permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
consummation of the Merger shall become final and non-appealable (whether
before or after the approval of the Merger by the Company Requisite Vote); or

  



  

(d) any Governmental Entity shall have failed to issue an order, decree or
ruling or to take any other action which is necessary to fulfill the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(d), as applicable, and (i) such
denial of a request to issue such order, decree, ruling or take such other
action shall have been final and nonappealable or (ii) such order, decree,
ruling or other action is not reasonably likely to be issued or taken prior
to December 31, 2005;

  



  

provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.2 shall not be available to any party that has breached in any
material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any manner
that shall have proximately contributed to the occurrence of the failure of
the Merger to be consummated.

  



  

Section 8.3 _Termination by the Company_. This Agreement may be terminated
and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by
action of the Company Board:

  



  

(a) prior to the Company Requisite Vote, if the Company Board shall have
approved, and the Company shall have concurrently entered into, a definitive
agreement providing for the implementation of a Superior Proposal (a "
_Superior Proposal Agreement_ "), so long as such action is in full
compliance with and not prohibited by Section 6.6 and the Company notifies
Parent, in writing, promptly and at least two (2) business days prior to such
termination, of its intention to enter into such a Superior Proposal
Agreement, attaching the most current draft of such Superior
Proposal Agreement (or a description of all material terms and conditions
thereof), Parent does not make, within two (2) business days of receipt of
such written notification, a written offer that the Company Board determines,
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisers, is at least as
favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior Proposal and
the Company prior to or concurrently with such termination pursuant to this
Section 8.3(a) pays to Parent in immediately available funds any amount
required to be paid at such time pursuant to Section 8.6(b);

  



  

(b) if there is a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that cannot be
cured (or, if curable, the breaching party shall not be diligently attempting
to cure such breach after written notice of such breach by the terminating
party) and would cause a

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) to be incapable of being
satisfied as of the Termination Date; or

  



  

(c) upon written notice to Parent if the Commitment Letter shall have expired
or have been terminated or prior to the end of any calendar quarter ending
after June 30, 2005 the Company requests Parent to deliver to the Company a
certificate pursuant to this Section 8.3(c) and Parent does not within thirty
(30) days of the date of such request, deliver a certificate of Parent signed
by a responsible officer stating that the Commitment Letter is in full force
and effect and that, after inquiry of the Financing Sources, Parent does not
know of any facts that would reasonably be expected to materially impair,
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Financing; provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.3(c)
shall not be available to the Company unless within ten (10) days of
receiving written notice by the Company of its intention to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.3(c), Parent does not (A) secure an extension
of the Commitment Letter (if expired or terminated), (B) secure an amendment
of the Commitment Letter that allows it to deliver the certificate referenced
in this Section 8.3(c), or (C) secure a commitment letter or definitive
agreement for alternative financing from reputable financing sources in an
amount sufficient to consummate the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.3(c) shall not
be available to the Company if it has breached in any material respect any of
its obligations, representations or warranties under this Agreement in a
manner that materially contributed to Parents inability to deliver the
certificate referenced in this Section 8.3(c).

  



  

Section 8.4 _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and
the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, by
action of the Parent Board:

  



  

(a) if the Company (i) enters into a Superior Proposal Agreement or (ii) the
Company Board breaches the provisions of Section 6.6(c) or (iii) recommends
to the stockholders of the Company an Acquisition Proposal or shall have
resolved to do so; or

  



  

(b) if there is a breach by the Company of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that cannot be cured and
would cause a condition set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) to be
incapable of being satisfied as of the Termination Date (or, if curable, the
breaching party shall not be diligently attempting to cure such breach after
written notice of such breach by the terminating party).

  



  

Section 8.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. In the event of
termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to
this Article VIII, this Agreement (other than the third sentence of Section
6.5(e), this Section 8.5, Sections 5.2(c), 6.12 and 8.6 and Article IX) shall
become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any
party hereto (or of any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, legal
and financial advisors or other representatives); provided, however, that no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or
damages resulting from

  



  

43   

     
   

  



  

any willful breach of any of its representations or warranties or the breach
of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.12.

(i) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a); or

  



  

(ii) Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4(a); or

  



  

(iii) this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 8.2(a) following
receipt by the Company of an Acquisition Proposal that has become publicly
known and within seven (7) months of such termination the Company enters into
a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, an Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company receive or will
receive pursuant to the terms of such definitive agreement cash or securities
having an aggregate value in excess of $47 per Share (provided that for
purposes of this Section 8.6(b)(iii), each reference to "twenty percent
(20%)" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a reference
to "fifty percent (50%)"); or

  



  

(iv) this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 8.2(b) following
receipt by the Company of an Acquisition Proposal that has become publicly
known prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting and within seven (7) months of
such termination the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect
to, or consummates, an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to which the
stockholders of the Company receive or will receive pursuant to the terms of
such definitive agreement cash or securities having an aggregate value in
excess of $47 per Share (provided that for purposes of this Section
8.6(b)(iii), each reference to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a reference to "fifty percent (50%)"),

  



  

then the Company shall pay to Parent on or before the Termination Payment
Date a termination fee in an amount equal to $49,500,000 (the " _Termination
Amount_ "). As used in this Agreement, " _Termination Payment Date_ " shall
mean (A) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.3(a) or Section
8.4(a)(i), prior to or simultaneously with such termination, (B) in the case
of a termination pursuant to Section 8.4(a)(ii) or (iii), within ten (10)
business days after such termination, and (C) in the case of a termination
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b), within two (2) business days
after any entry

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

into a definitive agreement with respect to, or any consummation of, any
Acquisition Proposal, under the circumstances described in Section
8.6(b)(iii) or (iv), as applicable.

  



  

(c) Each of Parent and the Company agrees that the payments provided for in
this Section 8.6 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties upon a
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, and such remedy shall
be limited to the payments stipulated in this Section 8.6; provided, however,
that nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any party hereto of any
liability or damages resulting from any willful breach of any of its
representations and warranties or the breach of any of its covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Any payment required to be made pursuant to this Section 8.6 shall be
made on the requisite payment date by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Parent or the Company, as applicable.

  



  

Section 8.7 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub at any time before or after approval of the
Merger by the Company Requisite Vote but, after any such approval,
no amendment shall be made which requires the approval of such stockholders
under applicable Law without such approval.  This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the parties
hereto.

  



  

Section 8.8 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
each party hereto (for these purposes, Parent and Merger Sub shall together
be deemed one party and the Company shall be deemed the other party) may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document,
certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance by
the other party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein.
Any agreement on the part of either party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
