ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of the
DLLCA, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be

1.2 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Unless this Agreement is
earlier terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take
place as promptly as practicable, but in no event more than five (5) Business
Days, following the date on which the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
legally permitted) of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ (other than
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) occurred (such
date, the " _Closing Condition Satisfaction Date_ "), at the offices of
Morrison and Foerster LLP, 425 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94105, unless
another place or date is agreed to by Parent and the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Closing shall not occur after December 31, 2012 without the
prior written consent of PGP and Parent (in each case, to be provided in
their sole discretion), except pursuant to a grant of specific performance by
a court of competent jurisdiction in connection with an action for specific
performance which satisfies the criteria set forth in  _Section 8.1(h)_ or
_Section 8.1(i)_.

 



2  The date upon which the Closing occurs is herein referred to as the "
_Closing Date_." On the Closing Date, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a properly
executed certificate of merger satisfying the requirements of the DLLCA (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DLLCA (the time of
acceptance by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the
Certificate of Merger, or such subsequent time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger, being referred to herein
as the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions
of the DLLCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all rights, powers and property of the Company
and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts,
obligations and liabilities of the Company and Merger Sub shall become debts,
obligations and liabilities of the Surviving Company.

1.4 _Certificate of Formation and Limited Liability Company Agreement of the
Surviving Company_.

(a) Unless otherwise determined by Parent, at the Effective Time, the
certificate of formation of the Surviving Company shall be amended to read in
its entirety as the certificate of formation of Merger Sub read immediately
prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended as provided therein and
by applicable Law, except that the name of the Surviving Company shall be
"Boyd Gaming Holdings, LLC" or other name as Parent may determine. 

(b) At the Effective Time, the Company LLC Agreement shall terminate and the
limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the limited liability company agreement
of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended as provided therein and by
applicable Law.

 

1.5 _Directors, Officers and Managers of the Surviving Company and the Company
Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the managers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the managers or directors, as the case may be, of the
Surviving Company and the Company Subsidiaries, to hold office in accordance
with the certificate of formation and the limited liability company agreement
of the Surviving Company and the organizational and governing documents of
the Company Subsidiaries.

(b) At the Effective Time, the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, each to hold office in accordance with the limited
liability company agreement of the Surviving Company and the organizational
and governing documents of the Company Subsidiaries.

1.6 _Treatment of the Surviving Company Under the Parent
Indebtedness Agreements_. At the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall
be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary under the Parent Indebtedness
Agreements until thereafter determined by Parent.

COMPANY MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS; MERGER CONSIDERATION

the Member, the following shall occur at the Effective Time:

 

(a) _Interests of Merger Sub_. All of the issued and outstanding membership
interests of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable membership interests of the Surviving Company.

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Interests_. Any Company Membership Interest that
is owned by the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent or Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist without payment of any consideration with respect
thereto.

 

(c) _Company Membership Interests_. All Company Membership Interests
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
converted into and represent the right of the Member to receive the following:

(i) an amount in cash equal to the Up-Front Cash Merger Consideration; and

(ii) the HoldCo Note in an original principal amount equal to the Closing
Principal Amount (as adjusted from time to time in accordance with this
Agreement and the terms of the HoldCo Note); and

(iii) subject to _Section 2.6(f)_, an amount equal to the Contingent Merger
Consideration, if any, to be paid in cash by HoldCo or, at the option of
HoldCo, by increasing the Principal Amount of the HoldCo Note by the amount
of the Contingent Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.6(f)_.

 

(d) _Satisfaction of Rights in Company Membership Interests_. The Merger
Consideration, once fully paid to the Member in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the Company Certificate of Formation, the Company LLC
Agreement and the DLLCA, shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to all Company Membership Interests. 

(e) _No Further Registration of Transfer_. After the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Company of Company Membership Interests that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any documentation
representing any Company Membership Interests is presented to the Surviving
Company or Parent for any reason, such documentation shall be canceled and
deemed to have been exchanged for Merger Consideration in accordance with, and
pursuant to, this _Article 2_.

 



4 (f) _Company Equity Rights_. The Company shall cause each Company Equity
Right that is outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether or not then
exercisable or vested, to be terminated prior to the Effective Time and any
cost incurred in connection with such termination, including the redemption
cost in connection with the termination of the Company Equity Rights, shall
be paid by the Company. No Company Equity Rights shall survive the Effective
Time.

2.2 _Determination of Merger Consideration; Working Capital Adjustment_.

(a) Subject to determination and adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.5_
and _Section 2.6_, respectively, the total consideration (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ") to be paid to the Member in connection with the Merger
shall be:

(i) the Base Amount, _minus_ (o) the Required Improvement Remaining Balance,
_minus_ (p) Closing Company Debt, _plus_ (q) Closing Company Cash, _minus_ (r)
Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital Shortfall (if any), _plus_ (s) Closing
Adjusted Net Working Capital Surplus (if any), _minus_ (t) Company
Transaction Expenses, _minus_ (u) Company Specified Liabilities, _plus_ (v)
Company Specified Assets, _minus_ (w) Kansas Star Phase 1A and 1B Unpaid
Costs,  _minus_ (x) Kansas Star Phase 2 Unpaid Costs, _plus_ (y) the City
Bonds Deemed Value (such amount, the " _Base Merger Consideration_ "); and

 

(ii) a contingent amount equal to the Contingent Merger Consideration, if any.

 

(b) A sample calculation of the Base Merger Consideration and its components,
together with the policies, procedures and methodologies (if any) to be used
in calculating the Base Merger Consideration and its components, is set forth
on _Exhibit A_ (the " _Sample Base Merger Consideration Calculation_ "). The

no agreed-upon modifications, the Draft Preliminary Closing Report shall be
the Preliminary Closing Report; _provided_ , _however_ , that the inclusion

written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ")
specifying, in reasonable detail, the nature and amount of any disputed item

data to support its

 



7  position. The Member and Parent shall be deemed to have agreed with all
items and amounts in the Post-Closing Report not specifically addressed in the
Notice of Disagreement, and such items and amounts shall not be subject to
review under _Section 2.5(c)_ or _Section 2.5(d)_.

(c) During the ten (10) Business Day period following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement by the Member to Parent, Parent and the Member shall seek in good
faith to resolve any Disputed Items. During such ten (10) Business Day period,
the Member and Parent shall each provide the other and their respective
Representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable advance notice, to the working papers of Parent and the Member and
their respective Representatives relating to such Notice of Disagreement and
the Disputed Items, and the Member and Parent shall, and shall cause their
respective Representatives to, cooperate with the other and their respective
Representatives to provide them with other information used in preparation of
such Notice of Disagreement or relating to any Disputed Item reasonably
requested by the Member, Parent or their respective Representatives including,
upon reasonable advance notice, access during normal business hours to

Any Disputed Items resolved and set forth in a written agreement between the
Member and Parent within such ten (10) Business Day period shall be final and
binding on the Parties with respect to such Disputed Items for all purposes
hereunder.

(d) If the Member and Parent have not resolved all Disputed Items by the end
of such ten (10) Business Day period, the Member and Parent (w) shall submit,
in writing, to such independent public accounting firm as shall be reasonably
agreed in writing by the Member and Parent prior to the Closing Date (the "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ "), their respective briefs detailing their
respective views as to the correct nature and amount of each remaining
Disputed Item and the amounts of Closing Company Cash, Closing Company Debt,
Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital, Company Transaction Expenses, Company
Specified Liabilities, Company Specified Assets, Kansas Star Phase 1A and 1B
Unpaid Costs, Kansas Star Phase 2 Unpaid Costs, and Required Improvement
Remaining Balance (in each case, if and to the extent disputed) and the City
Bonds Deemed Value, (x) shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to make
its determination with respect to such remaining Disputed Items in accordance
with the Sample Base Merger Consideration Calculation, (y) shall instruct the
Independent Accounting Firm to, and use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to, render a
written decision resolving such remaining Disputed Items within twenty (20)
Business Days following such submission, and (z) shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, provide reasonable cooperation to the Independent
Accounting Firm in connection with the resolution of such remaining Disputed
Items. The Independent Accounting Firm shall (i) act in its capacity as an
expert and not as an arbitrator, (ii) consider only such remaining Disputed
Items, (iii) be authorized to resolve such remaining Disputed Items within
the range of the difference between Parents position with respect thereto and
the Members position with respect thereto (meaning, for example, that its
final determination of any disputed amount will be within (and not outside
of) the upper and lower bounds set forth by Parent and the Member for such
amount), and (iv) shall issue a written report (the " _Accountant s Report_")
setting forth in reasonable detail (A) its determination as to each Disputed
Item, (B) its calculation of Closing Company Cash, Closing Company Debt,
Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital, Company Transaction Expenses, Company
Specified Liabilities, Company Specified Assets, Kansas Star Phase 1A and 1B
Unpaid Costs, Kansas Star Phase 2 Unpaid Costs, and

 



8  Required Improvement Remaining Balance based on its determination of such
Disputed Items and (C) its calculation of the Base Merger Consideration based
thereon and on the City Bonds Deemed Value, which Accountants Report shall
be accompanied by a certificate from the Independent Accounting Firm that it
reached such determination in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
2.5(d)_. The Accountants Report shall be final and binding on the Parties
for all purposes hereunder, and the Parties acknowledge and agree that
judgment may be entered upon the Accountants Report in any competent court.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the expenses
relating to the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid by
either Parent or the Member, as the case may be, whose proposed calculation of
all amounts in dispute (on a net basis), as set forth in their respective
briefs submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm, was further from the
final amounts (on a net basis) as set forth in the Accountants Report;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the Member is responsible for
the Independent Accounting Firm expenses, Parent shall pay such Independent
Accounting Firm expenses and reduce the Principal Amount of the HoldCo Note by
an equal amount (which shall be deemed a Loss, which shall not be subject to
the Threshold Amount, including not counting towards the Threshold Amount),
without interest, or, at the option of Parent, offset an equal amount against
the Contingent Merger Consideration (if any). Each Party shall bear its own
costs (and that of its Representatives) incurred in connection with their
preparation or review of the Post-Closing Report and preparation or review of
any Notice of Disagreement, as applicable.

(e) The Estimated Base Merger Consideration shall be adjusted:

 

(i) downwards by the amount (if any) by which Closing Company Cash, as finally
determined pursuant to this  _Section 2.5_, is less than Estimated Closing
Company Cash;

(ii) upwards by the amount (if any) by which Closing Company Cash, as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, is greater than Estimated Closing
Company Cash;

(iii) downwards by the amount (if any) by which Closing Company Debt, as
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, is greater than Estimated

Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, is less than
Estimated Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital;

 

(vi) upwards by the amount (if any) by which Closing Adjusted Net Working
Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this  _Section 2.5_, is greater
than Estimated Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital;

 



9 (vii) downwards by the amount (if any) by which Company Transaction Expenses,
as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, are greater than
Estimated Company Transaction Expenses; and

(viii) upwards by the amount (if any) by which Company Transaction Expenses,
as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, are less than Estimated
Company Transaction Expenses. 

(ix) downwards by the amount (if any) by which Company Specified Assets, as
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, are less than Estimated
Company Specified Assets;

(x) upwards by the amount (if any) by which Company Specified Assets, as
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, are more than Estimated
Company Specified Assets;

(xi) downwards by the amount (if any) by which Company Specified Liabilities,
as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, are greater than
Estimated Company Specified Liabilities; 

(xii) upwards by the amount (if any) by which Company Specified Liabilities,
as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, are less than
Estimated Company Specified Liabilities;

(xiii) downwards by the amount (if any) by which Kansas Star Phase 1A and 1B
Unpaid Costs, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, are
greater than Estimated Kansas Star Phase 1A and 1B Unpaid Costs;

 

(xiv) upwards by the amount (if any) by which Kansas Star Phase 1A and 1B

(xv) downwards by the amount (if any) by which Kansas Star Phase 2 Unpaid
Costs, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, are greater than
Estimated Kansas Star Phase 2 Unpaid Costs;

 

(xvi) upwards by the amount (if any) by which Kansas Star Phase 2 Unpaid
Costs, as finally determined pursuant to this  _Section 2.5_, are less than
Estimated Kansas Star Phase 2 Unpaid Costs;

(xvii) downwards by the amount (if any) by which the Required Improvement
Remaining Balance, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, is
greater than the Estimated Required Improvement Remaining Balance used as part
of the Estimated Base Merger Consideration; and

(xviii) upwards by the amount (if any) by which the Required Improvement
Remaining Balance, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, is
less than the Estimated Required Improvement Remaining Balance used as part of
the Estimated Base Merger Consideration.

 



10 The Estimated Base Merger Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to this _Section
2.5_, is referred to herein as the " _Adjusted Base Merger Consideration_."

(f) If the Adjusted Base Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated Base
Merger Consideration, then Parent shall have the right to reduce the Principal
Amount of the HoldCo Note by an amount (which shall be deemed a Loss and which
shall not be subject to the Threshold Amount, including not counting towards
the Threshold Amount) equal to the difference between the Estimated Base
Merger Consideration and the Adjusted Base Merger Consideration (such
difference, the " _Parent True-Up Amount_ ") or, at the option of Parent,
offset an amount equal to the Parent True-Up Amount against the amount of the
Contingent Merger Consideration (if any).

(g) If the Adjusted Base Merger Consideration is greater than the Estimated
Base Merger Consideration, then the Principal Amount of the HoldCo Note shall
be increased by an amount equal to the difference between the Adjusted Base
Merger Consideration and the Estimated Base Merger Consideration (such
difference, the " _Member True-Up Amount_ ").

2.6 _Contingent Merger Consideration_.

(a) Parent and HoldCo agree to operate KSC, and to cause KSC to conduct its
business and operations, during the Measurement Period in a manner consistent
in all material respects with the past practices of KSC during 2013 and 2014.

 

(b) During the Measurement Period, HoldCo and the Surviving Company shall, and
shall cause KSC to, prepare and deliver to the Member a statement setting
forth HoldCos calculation of the Kansas Star Actual EBITDA, with

after the end of each such quarterly accounting period; and

(ii) for the Measurement Period within sixty (60) days after the last day of
the Measurement Period (the " _Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA
Statement_ ") certified by HoldCos independent auditor.

 

(c) During the thirty (30) day period following delivery of the Measurement
Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA Statement to the Member, HoldCo shall
provide, and cause the Surviving Company and KSC to provide, the Member and
its Representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable advance notice, to the internal unaudited working papers of HoldCo
(the " _HoldCo Working Papers_ "), to the extent used in determining the
matters set forth in the Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA
Statement, and HoldCo shall cooperate, and cause the Surviving Company and
KSC to cooperate, with the Member and its Representatives to provide them with
such other financial information regarding KSC (the " _KSC Additional
Information_ ") used in preparing the 

 



11  Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA Statement as is reasonably
requested by the Member and its Representatives, including access during
normal business hours to a Representative of Parent (as determined by Parent
in its sole discretion). In addition, solely for the purpose of evaluating the
Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA Statement, during the thirty (30)
day period following delivery of the Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual
EBITDA Statement to the Member, HoldCo shall provide the Member and its
Representatives with the HoldCo Working Papers and the KSC Additional
Information, to the extent such information is reasonably requested by
the Member, relating to any periods after the Closing Date. The Measurement
Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA Statement shall become final and binding on
the thirtieth (30) day following delivery thereof unless, prior to the end of
such period, the Member delivers to HoldCo written notice of its disagreement
(a " _Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA Notice of Disagreement_ ")
specifying, in reasonable detail, the nature and amount of any disagreement
with any item or amount in the Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA
Statement (each, a " _Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA Disputed
Item_ "), including calculations to support its position. The Member and
HoldCo shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts in the
Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA Statement not specifically
addressed in the Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA Notice of
Disagreement, and such items and amounts shall not be subject to review under
_Section 2.6(d)_ or _Section 2.6(e)_.

(d) During the ten (10) Business Day period following delivery of a
Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA Notice of Disagreement by the
Member to HoldCo, HoldCo and the Member shall seek in good faith to resolve
any Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA Disputed Items. During such
ten (10) Business Day period, the Member and HoldCo shall provide the other
and their respective Representatives with reasonable access during normal
business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the working papers of
HoldCo and the Member and their respective Representatives to the extent used
in determining or relating to the matters set forth in the Measurement Period
Kansas Star Actual EBITDA Statement and such Measurement Period Kansas
Star Actual EBITDA Notice of Disagreement. Any Measurement Period Kansas Star
Actual EBITDA Disputed Item resolved and set forth in a written agreement
between the Member and HoldCo within such ten (10) Business Day period shall
be final and binding on the Parties and the Member with respect to such
Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA Disputed Item for all purposes
hereunder.

(e) If the Member and HoldCo have not resolved all Measurement Period Kansas
Star Actual EBITDA Disputed Items by the end of such ten (10) Business Day
period, the Member and HoldCo (w) shall submit, in writing, to the
Independent Accounting Firm, their respective briefs detailing their
respective views as to the correct nature and amount of each remaining

views, (x) shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to make its
determination with respect to such remaining Measurement Period Kansas Star
Actual EBITDA Disputed Items in accordance with the Sample Kansas EBITDA
Calculation, (y) shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to, and use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent
Accounting Firm to, render a written decision resolving such remaining
Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA Disputed Items within twenty (20)
Business Days following such submission, and 

 



12  (z) shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, provide
reasonable cooperation to the Independent Accounting Firm in connection with
the resolution of such remaining Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA
Disputed Items. The Independent Accounting Firm shall (i) act in its capacity
as an expert and not as an arbitrator, (ii) consider only such remaining
Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA Disputed Items, (iii) be
authorized to resolve such remaining Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual
EBITDA Disputed Items within the range of the difference between HoldCos
position with respect thereto and the Members position with respect thereto
(meaning, for example, that its final determination of any disputed amount
will be within (and not outside of) the upper and lower bounds set forth by
HoldCo and the Member for such amount), and (iv) shall issue a written report
(the " _EBITDA Report_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail (A) its
determination as to each Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA Disputed
Item and (B) its calculation of the Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual
EBITDA based on its determination of such Measurement Period Kansas Star
Actual EBITDA Disputed Items, which EBITDA Report shall be accompanied by a
certificate from the Independent Accounting Firm that it reached such
determination in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.6(e)_.
The EBITDA Report shall be final and binding, absent manifest error in the
computation included in such EBITDA Report, on HoldCo and the Member for all
purposes hereunder, and HoldCo and the Member acknowledge and agree that
judgment may be entered upon the EBITDA Report in any competent court.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the expenses
relating to the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm contemplated
by this _Section 2.6(e)_ shall be paid by either HoldCo or the Member, as
the case may be, whose proposed calculation of all amounts in dispute (on a
net basis), as set forth in their respective briefs submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm, was further from the final amounts (on a net
basis) as set forth in the EBITDA Report; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event the Member is responsible for the Independent Accounting Firm expenses,
HoldCo shall pay such Independent Accounting Firm expenses and shall have the
right to reduce the Principal Amount of the HoldCo Note by such amount or, at
the option of Parent, offset an equal amount (which shall be deemed a Loss,
which shall not be subject to the Threshold Amount, including not counting
towards the Threshold Amount), without interest, against the amount of the
Contingent Merger Consideration (if any). Each Party shall bear its own costs
(and those of its Representatives) incurred in connection with
their preparation or review of the Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual
EBITDA Statement and preparation or review of any Measurement Period EBITDA
Notice of Disagreement, as applicable.

 

(f) If the Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA exceeds One Hundred
and Five Million Dollars ($105,000,000) (the " _Target EBITDA Amount_ "),
then, at the option of Parent, either (i) HoldCo shall deliver to the Member,
within five (5) Business Days of the Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual
EBITDA being agreed by the parties or HoldCos receipt of the EBITDA Report
setting forth the Independent Accountant Firms determination of the
Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA or other final determination of
the Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA pursuant to _Section
2.6(c)_ or _Section 2.6(d)_, an amount (the " _Contingent Merger
Consideration_ ") in cash equal to the sum of the amount of such excess
_multiplied_ _by_ the EBITDA Multiplier, subject to any offset pursuant to
_Section 2.6(e)_ or _Section 7.2_, or (ii) the Principal Amount of the
HoldCo Note shall be increased by the amount of such net Contingent Merger
Consideration. If the Measurement Period Kansas Star Actual EBITDA equals or
is less than the Target EBITDA Amount, no Contingent Merger Consideration
shall be due or owing.

 



13 (g) If the determination of the Contingent Merger Consideration and
the payment thereof (if any) has not been completed pursuant to this _Section
2.6_ and the HoldCo Note is repaid or is otherwise no longer in effect, HoldCo
shall continue to be bound by all of the restrictive covenants set forth in
the HoldCo Note (other than the covenant set forth in section 5.05 of the
HoldCo Note (regarding restricted payments)) until the resolution of the
matters set forth in _Section 2.6(f)_ unless Parent or the Company assumes,
or provides a guarantee of (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
PGP), all of HoldCos obligations under this _Section 2.6_.

(h) The provisions of this _Section 2.6_ shall constitute the exclusive and
sole means for resolving those disputes, disagreements, controversies or
claims between HoldCo and the Member with respect to the calculation of any
Contingent Merger Consideration. The Member acknowledges and agrees that
following the completion of the Merger, neither Parent nor HoldCo shall have
any obligation to operate its respective business (including the businesses
of the Surviving Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to achieve or maximize
the Contingent Merger Consideration.

(i) Any Kansas Star Sale consummated at any time prior to the end of the
Measurement Period with a third party purchaser shall, as a condition thereto,
require (in a written agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to the Member) that the each of the third party purchaser and KSC assumes all
of HoldCos remaining obligations with respect to the Contingent Merger
Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless the Member shall have
consented to such third party purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) or agreed that KSC has sufficient assets to
secure the payment of the expected Contingent Merger Consideration
(such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
such assumption shall not release HoldCo from, or affect or limit in any
respect, HoldCos obligations with respect to such obligations; _provided_
_further_ ,  _however_ , that in the event that the Member consents to such
third party purchaser or agrees KSC has sufficient assets to secure the
payment of the expected Contingent Merger Consideration, then HoldCo shall be
fully and unconditionally released from, and shall have no further
obligations in respect of, such assumed obligations.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
a Force Majeure Event occurs during the Measurement Period, the period of time
during which the Force Majeure Event occurs and continues to have the effect
specified in the definition thereof (" _Force Majeure Event Duration_ ")
shall be excluded from the Measurement Period, and the Measurement Period
shall be extended (the " _Measurement Period Extension_ ") by the period of
time of such Force Majeure Event Duration.

(k) From and after the Closing Date until the end of the Measurement
Period, subject to the execution of a mutually agreeable confidentiality
agreement among HoldCo, KSC and the Member, HoldCo shall, and shall cause KSC
to, deliver to the Member true and complete copies of (i) any monthly revenue
statement that KSC and its Affiliates file with the Kansas Racing and Gaming
Commission or any other Gaming Authority in Kansas pursuant to K.A.R.
112-104-5(a)(1)-(4), in each case, as promptly as practicable (but in no event
later than seven (7) Business Days) after the filing or delivery of such
monthly revenue statement to the Kansas Racing and Gaming Commission or such
other Gaming Authority and (ii) quarterly financial statements materially
consistent with what Parent prepares for its gaming properties (the form of
which is attached hereto as _Exhibit F_) within forty-five (45) days
following each quarter.

 



14 2.7 _Management Services Termination Amount_.

 

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall pay, in consideration of
the termination of the PGP Advisors Management Services Agreement pursuant to

the PGP Advisors Management Services Termination Amount.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall pay, in consideration of

2.8 _Tax Consequences_. Notwithstanding the agreed upon Merger Tax Treatment,
no Party makes any representation or warranty to any other Party regarding the
Tax treatment of the Merger, or any of the Tax consequences to Parent, the
Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or the Member of this Agreement or
any of the other transactions or agreements contemplated hereby. The Member
and Parent acknowledge that each is relying solely on its own Tax advisors in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions and
agreements contemplated hereby.

2.9  _Merger Tax Treatment_.

(a) The Member and Parent agree that the Merger and the transfer of all of
the membership and other equity interests in OED Acquisition, LLC shall be
treated (the " _Merger Tax Treatment_ ") for federal and applicable state and
local income or franchise Tax purposes as an acquisition of all of the assets
that the Member is treated as owning for such Tax purposes except for those
assets that the Member holds directly rather than through the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and OED Acquisition, LLC (the " _Purchased Assets_ ").
For purposes of applying this _Section 2.9(a)_, Parent and the Member
acknowledge that a portion of the Contingent Merger Consideration will be
treated as "imputed interest" under Section 483 of the Code.

 

(b) As soon as possible after the Closing Date, Parent and the Member shall
cooperate to reach a proposed allocation of the Merger Consideration and
Closing Company Debt (to the extent Closing Company Debt is properly treated
as a liability required to be allocated among the Purchased Assets under
Section 1060 of the Code) among the Purchased Assets (the " _Proposed
Allocation_ "). The Proposed Allocation shall be made in a manner consistent
with the principles of Section 1060 of the Code. Following the Closing Date,
Parent and the Member shall endeavor in good faith to reach final agreement
upon an allocation (the " _Final Allocation_ "). If Parent and the Member are
unable to reach agreement on a Final Allocation within ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date, then Parent and the Member shall 

 



15  submit all such disputed items for resolution to the Independent Accounting
Firm, whose decision shall be final and binding upon Parent and the Member and
whose fees and expenses shall be borne equally by Parent and the Member. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall use its best efforts to reach a
determination as promptly as possible and in no event later than thirty (30)
days after submission of the matter to the Independent Accounting Firm.
Parent and the Member agree to be bound by any such Final Allocation. Neither
Parent, HoldCo, the Surviving Company, nor the Member shall take a position on
any Tax Return (including IRS Form 8594), before any Tax Authority or in any
judicial proceeding that is in any manner inconsistent with the Final
Allocation without the written consent of the other Parties or unless
specifically required pursuant to a determination by an applicable Tax
Authority. The Member and Parent shall (i) cooperate with each other in
connection with the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns
related to such Final Allocation, and (ii) promptly advise each other
regarding the existence of any Tax audit, controversy or Proceeding related
to any such Final Allocation. Parent and the Member agree to adjust the Final
Allocation as appropriate to reflect distributions of Contingent Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6_ or any adjustments to the
Principal Amount of the HoldCo Note pursuant to this Agreement.

(c) Each Party shall report the Management Services Termination Amount for
federal, state and local income and other Tax purposes as such Party
determines is appropriate under applicable Law.

2.10 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, Parent and its
officers and the officers of the Surviving Company are hereby authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, assignments or assurances that are reasonably necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect, confirm or continue in the Surviving Company,
Merger Sub or Parent title to any property or any right of the Company
as provided herein, and to do all other things necessary or desirable to
vest, perfect, confirm or continue title to such property or rights in the
Surviving Company, Merger Sub, or Parent and otherwise to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement in connection with the Merger.

2.11 _Withholding Rights; Deductions from Consideration_. Parent, HoldCo,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Company acknowledge that, under applicable Law
as of the date hereof, if a properly completed statement required by _Section
2.13_ is delivered to Parent at Closing in the form contained in _Exhibit C_
attached hereto, Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub and Surviving Company will not
withhold or deduct any Tax under Section 1445 of the Code in connection with
or as a result of any payment to be made pursuant to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of U.S.
federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law (including as a result of receiving a
notice pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-4) and to request any
necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate series of Form
W-8, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that except with respect to a
deduction or withholding Tax that applies as a result of the Members failure
to deliver to Parent at Closing a properly completed statement as required
by  _Section 2.13_ in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ , if Parent
determines that any amount is required by Law to be deducted or withheld from
a payment to be made pursuant to this Agreement, or that any Tax forms are
necessary to establish that no such deduction or

 



16  withholding is required, Parent shall notify the Member of this
determination no fewer than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date or five
(5) days prior to such later date any payment is made pursuant to this
Agreement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid
if such deducted or withheld amounts are paid to the appropriate Tax
Authority for the account of such Person.

2.12 _No Liability for Compliance with Escheat Laws_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of Parent, the Surviving
Company, or the Member shall be liable for any portion of the Merger
Consideration properly paid to a public official pursuant to and in
accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

2.13 _FIRPTA Certificate_. At the Closing, the Member shall deliver a
properly executed Certification of Non-Foreign Status issued by the Member,
certifying under penalties of perjury that the Member is not a foreign person
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2), in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit C_.

22 3.8 _Company SEC Documents; Financial Statements; and Internal Controls_.

 

(a) The Company has filed all forms, reports and other documents required to
be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2009 (such documents filed since
January 1, 2009, and those filed by the Company with the SEC subsequent to the
date of this Agreement, if any, including any amendments thereof, the "
_Company SEC Reports_ "). Each Company SEC Report (x) complied, or if filed
subsequent to the date of the Agreement will comply, as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("
_SOX_ ") and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and
(y) did not, at the time it was filed (or, if amended prior to the date
hereof, as of the date of such amendment), contain, or if filed after the
date hereof at the time of filing will not contain, any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No Company
Subsidiary is required to file any form, report or other document with the
SEC.

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company SEC
Reports (the " _Company Financial Statements_ ") (i) have been, or will be, as
the case may be, prepared from and in accordance with and accurately reflect
the books and records of the Company and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries
in all material respects, (ii) complied, or will comply, as the case may be,
as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (iii) was, or will be, as the
case may be, prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto), and (iv) fairly presents, or will fairly present, as the case may
be, in all material respects the consolidated financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of the Company and the consolidated Company
Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods
indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited interim statements, to
normal and recurring year-end adjustments).

(c) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the
principal financial officer of the Company (and each former principal
executive officer of the Company and each former principal financial officer
of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule
13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and
the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to
the Company SEC Reports, and the statements contained in such certifications
are true and correct. For purposes of this  _Section 3.8(c)_, "principal
executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings
given to such terms in SOX. Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding, "extensions of
credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402
of SOX. The Company is in compliance in all material respects with SOX.

 



23 (d) Neither PGP, the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a
party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-
balance sheet partnership or any similar contract or arrangement (including
any contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship
between or among the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any
"off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
of the SEC)), where the primary purpose or intended effect of such contract or
arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company or any of the other Company Subsidiaries
in the Companys or such other Company Subsidiarys published financial
statements or other of the Company SEC Reports.

(e) The Company maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting and accounting sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes, including to provide reasonable assurance
that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or
specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to
maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to assets that could have a
material effect on the Companys financial statements is permitted only in
accordance with managements general or specific authorization; and (iv) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to
any differences.

(f) The Company has in place "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that ensure that
material information that is required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and made known to its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

(g) the Companys management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness
of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting in compliance
with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX for the year ended December 31,
2011, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. the
Company has disclosed to the Companys outside auditors and the audit
committee of the Company (and made copies of such disclosures available to
Parent) (i) all known significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely, in the
opinion of the chief financial officer of the Company, to adversely affect in
any material respect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data, (ii) any known fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting of which the Company has
knowledge, and (iii) any known claim or allegation of any of the foregoing.
Since January 1, 2009, the Company has not received from its independent
auditors any oral or written notification of a (x) "significant deficiency"
or (y) "material weakness" in the Companys internal controls. For purposes of
this Agreement, the terms "reportable condition" and "material weakness" shall
have the meanings assigned to them in the Statements of Auditing Standards
60, as in effect on the date hereof.

 



24 (h) PGP has made available to Parent copies of all comment letters
received by the Company from the SEC since January 1, 2009, relating to the
Company SEC Reports and all responses of the Company thereto. There are no
outstanding unresolved issues with respect to PGP, the Company or the Company
SEC Reports noted in comment letters or other correspondence received by PGP,
the Company or their respective attorneys from the SEC, and there are no
pending (i) formal or, to the knowledge of the Company, informal
investigations of the Company by the SEC or (ii) to the knowledge of the
Company, inspection of an audit of the Companys financial statements by the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. To the knowledge of the Company,
since January 1, 2009 there has been no material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim that the Company or any other Company Subsidiary has
engaged in improper or illegal accounting or auditing practices or maintains
improper or inadequate internal accounting controls. Since January 1, 2009,
no current or former attorney representing PGP, the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries has reported evidence of a material violation of
securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by PGP, the
Company or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents
or to any director or executive officer of PGP or the Company.

(i) To the Companys knowledge, no employee of PGP, the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries has provided or is providing information to any law
enforcement agency regarding the possible commission of any crime or the
violation or possible violation of any applicable legal requirements of the
type described in Section 806 of SOX. Neither PGP, the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director,

interests in any assets or businesses, of Parent or any of its Affiliates, the

any assets or businesses), or any change in or restriction on the operation by
Parent or any of its Affiliates of any assets or businesses (including any
assets or businesses of the Surviving Company), if doing so would reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on Parents ability to receive
the anticipated benefits of the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , Parent shall

and all steps necessary to resist and contest such proceeding and to have
vacated, modified, reversed or suspended such injunction or order so as to

, that this _Section 5.7(f)_ shall not apply with respect to any acquisition
of assets or equity for which the Company has entered into a written
undertaking prior to the date of this Agreement and identified on _Schedule

right of such Party under this Agreement.

5.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
give prompt written notice to each other, to the extent it becomes aware, of

representation or warranty of PGP or the Company, on the one hand, or Parent
or Merger Sub, on the other hand, contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect (such that the condition contained in
_Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.2(a)_, as the case may be, would not be
satisfied), (b) any failure of PGP or the Company, on the one hand, or Parent
or Merger Sub, on the other hand, to comply with or satisfy in any material

delivery of any notice pursuant to this  _Section 5.9_ shall not limit or
otherwise affect any remedies available to the Party receiving such notice.

as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security to
prevent breaches of the provisions of this _Section 5.10_, to enforce

therewith, PGP and the Company will, and each will cause the Company
Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Parent to facilitate any such
interview, meeting or discussion. The Company shall use its

Company Employment Agreement of, the individuals listed on a separate writing
provided by Parent to the Company on the date of this Agreement and as may be
supplemented by Parent at any time prior to November 1, 2012 to include any
Specified Employees (such individuals, together with such included Specified
Employees the " _Identified Employees_ "); provided, that Parent provide
notice to the Company of each Specified Employee that Parent wishes to list
as an Identified Employee with sufficient time to terminate the employment of
such Specified Employee prior to the Closing pursuant to and in accordance
with the terms of such Specified Employees employment agreement, if any. All
of the payments, costs and expenses associated with, or payable upon, the
termination of the Identified Employees, including any "change of control",
severance or other payment that is triggered by such termination or the
consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall constitute "Company Transaction Expenses."

 

(b) _General Compensation and Benefits_. Each Employee (other than an
Identified Employee) employed by the Company as of the date of this
Agreement, or who may become employed by the Company after the date of this
Agreement in compliance with _Section 5.2(e)_ and who is continuing with
employment with the Surviving Company from and after the Closing Date (each,
a " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall receive for a period of at least six (6)
months following the Closing Date either (as determined by Parent in its sole
discretion) (i) employee benefits generally comparable in the aggregate
(other than any employee bonus plans) to those provided generally to Employees
employed by the Company as of the date of this Agreement, or (ii) standard
employee benefits offered by Parent to its employees of comparable status
(it being understood that if Parent chooses clause (ii) Parent shall offer
the Continuing Employees (A) an amount of base salary that is, in the
aggregate, substantially similar to that provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent, and (B) eligibility to participate in Parents bonus
plans in an amount and on terms that are, in the aggregate, substantially
similar to the amount and terms provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent. If Parent elects clause (ii) in the preceding sentence, with respect
to determination of vacation accrual and vesting in 401(k) plan related
benefits, Parent shall offer the Continuing Employees comparable length of
service (in determining length of service, Parent shall include each
Continuing Employees length of service with the Company, subject to
applicable non-discrimination rules)) and if Parent elects clause (ii) in the
preceding sentence at Closing, coverage for each Continuing Employee under
Parents benefit plans and programs shall commence as of 12:01 A.M. on the
Closing Date. Subject to the consent of any third-party insurer, no exclusion
of conditions pre-existing as of the commencement of the Continuing
Employees employment with Parent shall be imposed under Parents welfare
benefit plans and programs except to the extent applicable as of that date
under the comparable plan or program of the Company.

 



63 (c) _No Right to Continued Employment or Benefits; No Third-Party Rights_.
Neither Parent, Surviving Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries is
under any obligation to hire or retain any Employee, or provide any Employee
with any particular benefits (other than as may be expressly provided in
the Company Plans, subject to the terms and conditions thereof), or make any
payments or provide any benefits to those Employees whom Parent subsequently
terminates. Nothing in this _Section 5.11_ is intended to or does create any
third-party beneficiary rights or any other rights or obligations to or for
the benefit of anyone other than the Parties.

 

(d) _FICA, Employment Taxes_. With respect to any Employees terminated by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be responsible for all
FICA, payroll and employment Taxes relating to each Employee until the
termination of his or her employment with the Company, including any payments
made with respect to any Company Equity Rights. Parent shall be responsible
for all FICA, payroll and employment taxes relating to the Continuing
Employees commencing from the date on which their employment with Parent
commences.

 

(e) _Company Employee Plans_. To the extent Parent notifies the Company in
writing no less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (i)
effective immediately preceding the Closing, the Company will take action to
terminate any and all Company Plans, including any and all Company Plans
intended to qualify as qualified cash or deferred arrangements under Section
401(k) of the Code (each such Company Plan, a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") and,
the Company will provide Parent with reasonable evidence, in the form of
resolutions of the Company Board terminating such Company Plan, that such
plans have been terminated not later than, and effective immediately prior to,
the Closing pursuant to resolutions duly adopted by the Company Board or other
duly-designated authority, and (ii) the Company will take action prior to the
Closing to amend each such Company 401(k) Plan effective prior to its
termination to provide for the automatic payment of participants accounts
upon plan termination in the form of a lump sum.

 

(f) _Change of Control Bonus_. As a result of the Closing of transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, certain individuals will be entitled to
change of control bonuses or pay, without the occurrence of any other event
after the Closing. To the extent not paid prior to the Closing, such change of
control bonuses or payments will constitute Company Transaction Expenses.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including _Section
5.1_ and/or _Section 5.2_), the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall
have the right, exercisable in their sole discretion, to pay such change of
control bonuses and/or pay to such individuals on the Closing Date.

(g) _Deferred Compensation Plan_. Within the thirty (30) day period prior to
the Effective Time and subject to and conditioned upon the Closing, the
Company shall terminate the Companys Executive Nonqualified Excess Plan (the
" _Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") in accordance with its terms and subject to
compliance with Section 409A of the Code in all respects, it being understood
that Parent and its Affiliates shall in no event be required to terminate
any "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" maintained by Parent or its
Affiliates. As soon as administratively practicable following the effective
date of the termination of the

 



64  Deferred Compensation Plan, the Company shall commence distributing the
assets of the Deferred Compensation Plan. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary (including  _Section 5.1_ and/or _Section 5.2_),
(i) prior to the Closing on the Closing Date, the Company shall make all
contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan with respect to the payroll
occurring on the Closing Date, including all employer matching contributions,
and (ii) the Deferred Compensation Plan may be amended to effectuate this
_Section 5.11(g)_. Any payments with respect to the Deferred Compensation
Plan pursuant to this  _Section 5.11(g)_ shall if not previously taken into

_Section 2.2_ be taken into account in the adjustment to the Merger
Consideration pursuant to  _Section 2.5_.

the contrary (including _Section 5.1_ and/or _Section 5.2_), prior to the
Closing on the Closing Date, (i) the Company shall, and PGP shall cause the
Company to, pay to certain Employees of the Company (determined by PGP in
its sole discretion) and (ii) each Company Subsidiary shall, and PGP and the
Company shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, pay to each qualifying

to be paid in accordance with this _Section 5.11(h)_.

5.12 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Cooperation, Access to Information, and Record Retention_. The Member and
Parent shall cooperate, and cause their Representatives and Affiliates to
cooperate, to the extent reasonably requested by any other Party in connection
with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Member or a member of the
Member, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including any Taxes imposed
on the Member or a member of the Member as a result of its ownership interest
in the Company or any Company Subsidiary). Such cooperation shall include the
provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such
Tax Return, audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Member, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall (i) retain all books and records with respect to
Company and Company Subsidiaries Taxes (including Tax Returns) relating to
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations for assessment of Taxes for such respective taxable
period, and (ii) give the other parties hereto reasonable written notice prior
to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if
another party so requests, allow such party to take possession of such books
and records.

 

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. Any Transfer Taxes shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by
Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the Member. Either the Member or Parent, as
obligated by applicable Law, shall prepare and file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and the
Person that prepares and files such Tax Returns shall provide the other with
a copy thereof. If required by applicable Law, Parent or the Member, as
applicable, shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of
any such Tax Returns and other documentation;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
prior to the execution of any such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be
modified as Parent or the Member, as applicable, determines necessary in order
to comply with applicable Law.

 



65 (c) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any
Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts (including income, sales and
use and withholding taxes) of the Member (or the members of the Member,
as applicable), the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date and the amount of other
Taxes of the Member (or the members of the Member, as applicable), the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period that relates
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date, and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

 

(d) _Filing Tax Returns_. Unless otherwise provided in this _Section
5.12(d)_, Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to
be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are
filed after the Effective Time. With respect to any Tax Return that includes
the portion of a Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date,
Parent shall provide the Member with the opportunity to review and comment on
such Tax Return, and Parent shall not file (or cause to be filed) such Tax
Return without the prior written consent of the Member, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Member shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed all federal income Tax Returns, and all
applicable state and local income Tax or franchise Tax Returns, for the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior to
the Closing Date that are filed after the Closing Date. The Member shall
permit Parent to review each such Tax Return described in the preceding
sentence prior to filing and shall reasonably consider any comments provided
by Parent to such Tax Returns. The Member shall also prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed all other Tax Returns for the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date that are filed after the Closing Date. The Member shall provide
Parent with the opportunity to review and comment on such Tax Returns, and the
Member shall not file (or caused to be filed) such Tax Returns without
the prior written consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. The Member shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be filed all federal income Tax Returns, and all applicable state
and local income Tax or franchise Tax Returns for the Member. All Tax Returns
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall be prepared in accordance
with the existing procedures, practices and accounting methods of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, except to the extent such procedures, practices
and accounting methods do not have sufficient legal support to avoid the
imposition of penalties, fines or similar amounts.

 

(e) _Controversies_.

(i) To the extent any Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
under _Section 7.2(a)_ with respect to a Tax Matter, the Member shall have
the exclusive authority to control any audit or examination by any Tax
Authority, and contest, resolve and defend against any assessment for
additional Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of or
relating to any Tax liability of the Company or the Company 

 



66  Subsidiaries or Tax matter relating to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries (each, a " _Tax Matter_ "), for any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date, and the Member shall be entitled to any Tax refund
relating to such Taxes provided, however, that the Member shall provide to
Parent (at Parents expense) reasonable participation rights with respect to
so much of any Tax Matter that is reasonably likely to affect the Tax
liability of Parent, the Surviving Company, or any Company Subsidiary for any
Post-Closing Tax Period. The Member shall not enter into any settlement of, or
otherwise compromise, any such Tax Matter that would adversely affect
Parent, the Surviving Company, or any Company Subsidiary for any Post-Closing
Tax Period without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(ii) Parent shall have the exclusive authority to control any Tax Matter for
any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date. Parent shall not enter
into any settlement of, or otherwise compromise, any such Tax Matter that
would adversely affect the Member or a member of the Member for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of the Member, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Parent
shall have authority to control any Tax Matter with respect to the Surviving
Company or the Company, as applicable, and any Company Subsidiary that relates
to a Straddle Period, provided, however, Parent shall provide the Member (at
the Members expense) reasonable participation rights with respect to so much
of such Tax Matter that is reasonably likely to affect the Tax liability of a
Member or a member of the Member or for which the Member has an indemnity
obligation under _Section 7.2(a)_. Parent shall not enter into any settlement
of, or otherwise compromise, any such Tax Matter that would adversely affect a
Member or a member of the Member without the prior written consent of the
Member, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(f) _Termination of Tax Allocation Agreements_. Any tax allocation or sharing
agreement or arrangement, whether or not written, that may have been entered
into by the Member on the one hand, and the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be terminated as to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, and no payments which are owed by
or to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries pursuant thereto shall be made
thereunder. After the Closing Date, neither the Company nor the Company
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, nor the Member, on the other hand, shall have
any further rights or liabilities thereunder with respect to the other party
or parties.

(g) _Tax Refunds_. At the Members request, the Surviving Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall apply for any Tax refund for an amount in excess
of $100,000 that is available with respect to any Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period that was imposed on the Company or the Company Subsidiaries. The Member
or its Representative shall, at its own expense, prepare any Tax Return and
other required documentation to be filed by the Surviving Company or the
Company Subsidiaries to apply for such Tax refund. The Member shall reimburse
Parent, the Surviving Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all out-of-
pocket costs incurred in connection with obtaining such refund. With respect
to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, any Tax refund
(including any interest in respect thereof) received by Parent, the Surviving
Company or the Company Subsidiaries shall be for the account of the Member,
and Parent shall pay over to the Member any such amounts within fifteen (15)
days after the receipt or entitlement of such refund or credit. 

 



67 (h) _Allocation of Company Transaction Expenses_. Any deductions or other tax
benefits arising in connection with the payment of the Company Transaction
Expenses (or the payment of any fees, expenses or other amounts paid by a
Company Subsidiary in connection with the Merger that would have been treated
as Company Transaction Expenses if they had been paid by the Company) will be
allocated to the members of the Member as of the Closing Date in accordance
with the limited liability company agreement of the Member.

 

(i) _Effect on Indemnity Rights of Parent_. Nothing in this _Section 5.12_
shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the rights of Parent under
_Article 7_

5.13 _Litigation_. PGP and the Company will (a) notify Parent in writing
reasonably promptly after learning of any action, suit, arbitration,
mediation, proceeding, claim, or investigation by or before any Governmental
Entity or arbitrator initiated by or against PGP, the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, or to the Companys knowledge to be threatened against
PGP, the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective directors,
officers, managers, members or Employees in their capacity as such (a " _New
Litigation Claim_ "), (b) keep Parent reasonably informed of material
developments in any New Litigation Claim, and (c) consult in good faith with
Parent regarding the conduct of the defense of any New Litigation Claim. 

5.14 _Disclosure Schedules_. Parent and PGP and the Company may supplement the
information set forth on the Parent Disclosure Schedule and the Company
Disclosure Schedule, respectively, with respect to any matter now existing or
hereafter arising that, if existing or occurring at or prior to the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the
Parent Disclosure Schedule and the Company Disclosure Schedule, respectively,
on the date of this Agreement or that is necessary to correct any information
in the Parent Disclosure Schedule or the Company Disclosure
Schedule, respectively, which has been rendered inaccurate thereby reasonably
promptly following discovery thereof. Any such disclosure shall not be deemed
to constitute an exception to the representations and warranties of Parent or
Merger Sub under  _Article 4_ or the Company under _Article 3_ , as the case
may be, nor limit the rights of PGP and the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, under this Agreement for any breach by Parent or PGP or the Company, as
the case may be, of such representations and warranties or have any effect
for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Article 6_.

5.15 _Financial Statements_.

(a) The Company will deliver to Parent as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within thirty (30) days) after the end of each calendar month unaudited
financial statements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that
substantially conform to the requirements of the Company Financial
Statements.

(b) The Company acknowledges Parent must file with the SEC on Form 8-K
the financial statements required by Item 9.01 of Form 8-K. During the Pre-
Merger Period, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) afford and to make available to Parent and the independent public
accountants selected by Parent to perform the necessary reviews, and provide
to them reasonable access during normal business hours to, such records,
financial statements or other documentation as may be necessary or useful in
the preparation and audit of such required financial statements and (ii) to
assist in the preparation and audit of such financial statements in the manner
reasonably requested by Parent.

to perform its obligations under this Agreement upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

5.17  _Continuing Director and Officer Indemnification_.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent agrees to
cause the Surviving Company to ensure, and the Surviving Company immediately
following the Closing shall ensure, that all rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses, to the extent that the Surviving Company is
permitted to indemnify and advance under applicable Law, now existing in favor
of any individual who, at or prior to the Effective Time, was a director or
officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or who, at the
request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, served as a
trustee or fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries (within the meaning of Section 3.3 of
ERISA) (collectively, with such individuals heirs, executors or
administrators, the " _Indemnified Persons_ "), as provided in the respective
governing documents and indemnification agreements to which the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries is a party, shall survive the Merger and continue
in full force and effect, and the indemnification agreements and the
provisions with respect to indemnification and limitations on liability set
forth in such governing documents and indemnification agreements shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified (unless required by law) in a manner
that is adverse to any such Indemnified Persons; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six (6)
year period, all rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses in
respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until final disposition of
any and all such claims; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that any
such advancement of expenses shall be conditioned upon the Surviving
Companys receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Person to repay such
amount if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the
Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified in accordance with this
_Section 5.17_. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any action or investigation
or threatened action or investigation involving an Indemnified Person without
the written consent of such Indemnified Person.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to
obtain and fully pay for, at its sole cost and expense, for a period of six
(6) years thereafter, (i) a tail policy to the current policy of directors
and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company, which tail
policy shall be effective for a period from the Closing through and including
the date six (6) years after the Closing Date with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing, and which tail
policy shall contain terms with respect to coverage and amounts no less
advantageous in the aggregate than, the coverage currently provided by such
current policy; and (ii) "run-off" coverage as provided by the Companys
fiduciary and employee benefit policies, in each case, covering those Persons
who are covered on the date of this Agreement by such policies and with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less advantageous
than the coverage provided under the

 



69  Companys existing policies (the policies in clause (i) and (ii),
collectively, the " _Continuing Insurance Policies_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that in satisfying its obligation under this _Section 5.17(b)_, the
Surviving Company shall not be obligated to pay a premium in the aggregate in
excess of 250% of the amount per annum paid by the Company in its last full
fiscal year for such Continuing Insurance Policies, which amount has been
disclosed by the Company to Parent prior to the date hereof; _provided
further_ , _however_ , that if the premium for the Continuing Insurance
Policies exceeds such maximum amount, the Surviving Company shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such maximum amount.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub agree to cause
the Surviving Company, and the Surviving Company immediately following the
Closing agrees, to indemnify, to the extent that the Surviving Company is
permitted to indemnify under applicable Law, all Indemnified Persons with
respect to all acts and omissions arising out of such individuals services as
officers or directors of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or as
trustees or fiduciaries of any plan for the benefit of employees of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, occurring prior to the Effective
Time, including the execution of, and the transactions contemplated by,
this Agreement or the Related Agreements, other than to the extent resulting
from bad faith, gross negligence or intentional malfeasance. Without
limitation of the foregoing, in the event any such Indemnified Person is or
becomes involved in any action, proceeding or investigation in connection
with any act or omission in his or her capacity as a director or officer of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, occurring prior to and including the
Effective Time, the Surviving Company, from and after the Effective Time,
shall pay, as incurred, to the extent that the Surviving Company is permitted
to provide pay and advance under applicable Law, such Indemnified
Persons reasonable legal and other expenses (including the cost of any
investigation and preparation) incurred in connection therewith; _provided_
_further_ , _however_ , that any such advancement of expenses shall be
conditioned upon the Surviving Companys receipt of an undertaking by such
Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be
indemnified in accordance with this  _Section 5.17_.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Company contained in this _Section 5.17_ shall be binding upon
the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Company. In the event
Parent or the Surviving Company, or any of their respective successors or
assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person,
then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, honor the
indemnification obligations set forth in this _Section 5.17_.

(e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this _Section
5.17_ shall survive the Closing and shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to affect adversely any Indemnified Person to whom this
_Section 5.17_ applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified
Person (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Persons to whom this
_Section 5.17_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section
5.17_, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this _Section 5.17_).

 



70 5.18 _Parent Financings_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts:

 

(i) to obtain the Parent Debt Financing on or before December 20, 2012 (the "

Debt Commitment Letter (except to the extent that Parent has irrevocably
(other than the condition that the Closing occur) received funds from
alternative financings), including using commercially reasonable best efforts
to: (1) enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Parent Debt
Financing (including agreeing to any requested changes to the commitments
thereunder by the committed lenders in accordance with the related
flex provisions); (2) satisfy (or obtain a waiver) on a timely basis of all
conditions in such definitive agreements (within Parents control); and (3)
consummate the Parent Debt Financing contemplated by the Parent Debt
Commitment Letter on or prior to Closing, in each case, except to the extent

received funds from alternative financings. Parent shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of PGP,
take or fail to take any action or enter into any transaction that could
reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or prevent consummation of
the Parent Debt Financing contemplated by the Parent Debt Commitment Letter
(unless Parent has irrevocably (other than the condition that the Closing
occur) received funds equal to the amount of the Parent Debt Financing on
alternative terms). In the event any portion of the Parent Debt
Financing expires or is terminated or otherwise becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in the Parent Debt Commitment Letter, or in
the event Parent no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Parent Debt Financing contemplated by the
Parent Debt Commitment Letter on the terms described therein, Parent promptly
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) shall notify PGP of such
unavailability and the reasons therefor. Parent shall not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to the Parent Debt Commitment Letter, or
waive any provision or remedy under the Parent Debt Commitment Letter, without

contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this _Section 5.18(a)(i)_
shall require, and in no event shall the commercially reasonable best efforts
of Parent be deemed or construed to require, Parent to bring any enforcement
action against any Parent Financing Source in connection with obtaining the
Parent Debt Financing, except in the event that the Parent Financing Source
has materially breached (as reasonably determined by Parent) its obligations
under the Parent Debt Commitment Letter, in which case, Parent shall if
requested by PGP, use its commercially reasonable efforts to bring and pursue
an enforcement action against such Parent Financing Source; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that if PGP shall be responsible for, and bear as incurred, all of
the costs relating to bringing or pursuing the enforcement action, then the
costs required to be incurred by Parent in connection with such action shall
not be taken into consideration in Parents determination of the commercially
reasonable efforts to be made by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that in such
event Parents efforts to bring and pursue such an enforcement action shall be
subject to its reasonable efforts.

 



71 (ii) to obtain the PGL Debt Financing on or before the Parent Funding
Date, on the terms and conditions described in the PGL Refinancing Commitment
Letter (except to the extent that Parent has irrevocably (other than the

definitive agreements (within Parents control); and (3) consummate the PGL
Debt Financing contemplated by the PGL Refinancing Commitment Letter on or

irrevocably (other than the condition that the Closing occur) received funds
from alternative financings. Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of PGP, take or fail to
take any action or enter into any transaction that could reasonably be
expected to materially impair, delay or prevent consummation of the PGL Debt
Financing contemplated by the PGL Refinancing Commitment Letter (unless
Parent has irrevocably (other than the condition that the Closing occur)
received funds equal to the amount of the PGL Debt Financing on alternative
terms). In the event any portion of the PGL Debt Financing expires or is
terminated or otherwise becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the PGL Refinancing Commitment Letter, or in the event Parent
no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all or
any portion of the PGL Debt Financing contemplated by the PGL Refinancing
Commitment Letter on the terms described therein, Parent promptly (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours) shall notify PGP of such unavailability
and the reasons therefor. Parent shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to the PGL Refinancing Debt Commitment Letter, or
waive any provision or remedy under the PGL Refinancing Commitment Letter,

manner contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this _Section 5.18(a)(ii)_

of Parent be deemed or construed to require, Parent to bring any enforcement
action against any Parent Financing Source in connection with obtaining the
PGL Debt Financing, except in the event that the Parent Financing Source has
materially breached (as reasonably determined by Parent) its obligations
under the PGL Refinancing Debt Commitment Letter, in which case, Parent shall
if requested by PGP, use its commercially reasonable efforts to bring and
pursue an enforcement action against such Parent Financing Source; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that if PGP shall be responsible for, and bear as
incurred, all of the costs relating to bringing or pursuing the enforcement
action, then the costs required to be incurred by Parent in connection with
such action shall not be taken into consideration in Parents determination
of the commercially reasonable efforts to be made by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in such event Parents efforts to bring and pursue such an
enforcement action shall be subject to its reasonable efforts.

 



72 (iii) to keep available, at all times during the Pre-Merger Period, under the
revolving portion of the Parent Indebtedness Agreements the amount set forth

contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, during the Pre-Merger
Period, PGP and the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
and each of its and their respective managers, directors, officers, and

Debt Financing, and (ii) to provide all commercially reasonable information
and assistance reasonably requested by Parent in connection with arranging
and obtaining the Parent Debt Financing and PGL Debt Financing.

 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company reasonably informed with
respect to the Parent Debt Financing and the PGL Debt Financing, and shall
provide the Company with written notice promptly after the completion of the
Parent Debt Financing. If Parent or Merger Sub shall have knowledge of any
fact or event which will or would reasonably be expected to prevent
any Parent from timely consummating or otherwise receiving the proceeds of
the Parent Debt Financing or PGL Debt Financing, Parent shall as promptly as
practicable (and in any event not later than twenty-four (24) hours
thereafter) disclose the same in writing to the Company in reasonable detail.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if,

Financing under the terms and conditions of the Parent Debt Commitment
Letter, and (ii) all of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_
and _Section 6.3_ have been waived by Parent or satisfied (other than such
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the waiver by Parent or satisfaction of such conditions at the
Closing), then PGP shall have the right, upon written notice to Parent, to
require Parent (except to the extent Parent has irrevocably (other than the
condition that the Closing occur) received funds from alternative financings
and applies such funds to finance, in part, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) to draw down, at Closing, the Parent Debt Financing on the

82  respect to breaches of any Company Operative Documents or Parent Operative

case HoldCo shall have the right to either (i) reduce the Principal Amount of
the HoldCo Note by the amount of any Losses resulting therefrom (irrespective
of the HoldCo Note Indemnification Limit) or (ii) offset any Losses resulting
therefrom against the Contingent Merger Consideration (if any) that is or may
be payable to the Member hereunder if, and only if, the HoldCo Note
Indemnification Limit has been exceeded, the HoldCo Note has been fully
repaid, or the entire remaining Principal Amount of the HoldCo Note is less
than the aggregate Claim Amounts for all outstanding and unresolved
Indemnification Claims for which a Claim Notice has been delivered. Except as
provided in the first sentence of this clause _(d)_ , no Parent
Indemnified Party shall have any right to recourse directly against the
Member with respect to any indemnification claim under this _Article 7_.

(e) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
_Article 7_ shall be net of (i) any amount for which a reserve or accrual
directly related to such Loss is included and taken into account in the
Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 2.6_ and offset or monetized, (ii) any amounts directly related to
such Loss actually recovered by a Parent Indemnified Party (net of any costs
of investigation of the underlying claim and of collection) pursuant to any
indemnification by or indemnification agreement (other than this Agreement)
with any Person (other than any Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including
the Surviving Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries)), and (iii) any
insurance proceeds (net of any out-of-pocket costs of investigation of the
underlying claim and of collection, including attorney fees) received as a
direct offset against such Loss (each source of recovery referred to in

net Tax benefit to Parent, the Surviving Company, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or their Affiliates that is actually realized in the year in
which the indemnity payment is paid in connection with the payment or event
giving rise to such indemnity payment obligation. If the amount to be netted
hereunder in connection with a Collateral Source from any reduction in the
Principal Amount of the HoldCo Note or offset against the Contingent Merger
Consideration

 



83  required under _Article 7_ is received by a Parent Indemnified Party after
such reduction or offset has been made and paid to a Parent Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _Article 7_ , then either (i) the Principal Amount of the
HoldCo Note shall be increased or (ii) Parent shall repay to the Member,
promptly after such receipt, any amount that would not have resulted in a
reduction of the Principal Amount of the HoldCo Note or have been offset
pursuant to this _Article 7_ had such receipt occurred at the time of such
reduction or offset.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of Parent, Merger Sub,
PGP, the Company and the Surviving Company, as the case may be, and the
rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Indemnified Parties based on
such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations, will not be
limited or affected by any investigation conducted by Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company or any of their respective agents with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company or any of their respective agents, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to, the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation,

contained in _Section 3.22_ (Environmental Matters) to the extent (but only
to the extent) that such Losses result from, arise out of or relate to: (i)
any change in the use of the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property
on or after the Closing Date, but only to the extent such change in use
results in a more costly cleanup; (ii) any corrective, removal or remedial
actions or other measures taken in response to environmental conditions ("

conditions discovered as a result of any Phase II investigations or other

third-party Action or Action brought by any Governmental Entity.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the aggregate
liability of Parent for any and all claims for indemnification by the Member

party against or involving such Indemnified Party (each, a " _Third Party
Claim_ ") shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth below.

 



84 (b) The Indemnified Party Representative shall give prompt written notice
to the Indemnifying Representative of any Third Party Claim or Tax Matter
which might give rise to any Loss by such Indemnified Party, stating the
nature and basis of such Third Party Claim or Tax Matter and the amount
thereof to the extent known;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the
part of the Indemnified Party Representative in notifying the Indemnifying
Representative shall relieve Indemnifying Party from any Liability or forfeit
the Indemnifying Partys right of offset hereunder, as the case may be,
unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Representative is
prejudiced or damaged in any manner by such delay. Such notice shall be
accompanied by copies of all relevant documentation with respect to such
Third Party Claim or Tax Matter, including, without limitation, any summons,
complaint or other pleading which may have been served, any written demand or
any other document or instrument directly relating thereto.

 

(c) The Indemnified Party Representative shall have the right, in its sole
discretion, to conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim and the
Indemnifying Representative shall have the right to participate in any such
defense at the Indemnifying Representatives own expense; _provided_ ,
_however_ that the Indemnified Party Representative shall not have the right
to conduct such defense if the Third Party Claim involves criminal liability
of the Indemnifying Party, in which case, the Indemnifying Party shall defend
such Third Party Claim at its sole expense. In addition, in the event that
the Indemnified Party Representative elects to conduct the defense of such
Third Party Claim and then fails to defend such Third Party Claim or withdraws
from such defense, then the Indemnifying Representative may conduct the
defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnified Party Representatives
expense.

(d) Neither the Indemnified Party Representative, nor the Indemnifying

pursuant to this _Article 7_ (an " _Indemnification Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party Representative (on behalf of such Indemnified Party) shall
deliver a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying
Representative. Each Claim Notice shall, with respect to each Indemnification
Claim set forth therein, (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of the
Indemnification Claim being made and (ii) state the aggregate Dollar amount of
Losses to which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article 7_ that have been incurred, and a good faith
estimate of the aggregate Dollar amount of such Losses reasonably expected to
be incurred, by such Indemnified Party pursuant to such Indemnification Claim
(the " _Claim Amount_ ").

(b) If the Indemnifying Representative wishes to object to the allowance of
some or all Indemnification Claims made in a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying
Representative must deliver a written objection to the Indemnified Party
Representative within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt by
the Indemnifying Representative of such Claim Notice expressing such
objection and explaining in reasonable detail and in good faith the basis
therefor.

 



85  Following receipt by the Indemnified Party Representative of the
Indemnifying Representatives written objection, if any, the Indemnified Party
Representative and the Indemnifying Representative shall promptly, and within
ten (10) Business Days, meet to negotiate in good faith on their respective
rights with respect to each Indemnification Claim that is the subject of such
a written objection. If the Indemnifying Representative and the Indemnified

and the Indemnified Party Representative and (ii) if the Indemnified Party is
(A) a Parent Indemnified Party, the Principal Amount of the HoldCo Note shall

Amount of the HoldCo Note shall be increased by the amount of such Losses to
which such Member Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification as set
forth in such memorandum. In the event that the Indemnified Party
Representative and the Indemnifying Representative do not within such ten (10)
Business Day period prepare and sign a memorandum that addresses in full all
written objections timely delivered, the Indemnified Party Representative may
commence an Action to resolve any remaining disputes and enforce its rights
with respect thereto in any court available therefor.

 

(c) If the Indemnified Party Representative does not receive a response from
the Indemnifying Representative with respect to any Indemnification Claim set
forth in a Claim Notice by the end of the twenty (20) Business Days period
referred to in subsection (b) above, (i) the Indemnifying Representative shall
be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to object to such
Indemnification Claim and to have agreed that Losses in the amount of the
applicable Claim Amount are indemnifiable hereunder and (ii) if the
Indemnified Party is (A) a Parent Indemnified Party, the Principal Amount
of the HoldCo Note shall be reduced, effective as of the date after the
expiration of such period, by an amount equal to the Claim Amount and (B) a
Member Indemnified Party, Parent shall pay to the Member on behalf of such
Member Indemnified Party, as promptly as practicable and within five (5)
Business Days following expiration of such period, the Claim Amount. If not
paid, the Indemnified Party Representative may seek enforcement of the
obligation with respect to the Claim Amount in any court available therefor.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) Parent
shall only have the right to reduce the Principal Amount of the HoldCo Note by
the amount to which a Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
under this _Article 7_ after (A) such memorandum described in  _Section
7.5(b)_ has been entered into, (B) the Indemnifying Representative has failed
to timely respond as described in _Section 7.5(c)_ or (C) obtaining a
judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction that such Parent Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder in such amount, as applicable,
and (ii) the Principal Amount of the HoldCo Note shall be increased by the
amount to which a Member Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
under this _Article 7_ after (A) such memorandum described in _Section
7.5(b)_ has been entered into, (B) the Indemnifying Representative has failed
to timely respond as described in  _Section 7.5(c)_ or (C) obtaining a
judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction that such Member Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder in such amount, as applicable.

 



86 7.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The Indemnifying Parties,
Parent, the Surviving Company, and the Member agree to treat any
indemnification payment made pursuant to this _Article 7_ as an adjustment to
the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes, to the extent it may be
properly so treated for Tax purposes, and shall take no position contrary
thereto unless required to do so by applicable Tax Law.

7.7 _No Subrogation_. Following the Closing, no Indemnifying Party shall have
any right of indemnification, contribution or subrogation against the Company
or the Surviving Company with respect to any indemnification made by or on
behalf of any Indemnifying Party under  _Section 7.2_.

conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing or (y)

provision, as agreed upon in good faith by the Parties.

10.4 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that an award of money damages would be inadequate in any such event. It
is accordingly agreed that the Parties and the third party beneficiaries under
_Section 10.6_ shall be entitled to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this _Section 10.4_ (and the
remedies available pursuant to this _Section 10.4_) shall not apply, and the
Parties and third party beneficiaries shall have no such entitlement if (i)
Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(i)
and pays the Reverse Termination Fee, or (ii) PGP has the right to terminate
this Agreement and trigger Parents obligation to pay the Reverse Termination
Fee in accordance with _Section 8.3_ (or would have triggered Parents
obligation to pay the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3_, but
for the PGP Causation Exception),  _Section 8.3_ shall be PGP and the
Companys sole and exclusive remedy, except to the extent that PGP and the
Company exercises its right to enforce specifically (i) the obligations of
Parent under the last sentence of  _Sections 5.18(a)(i)_ and _5.18(a)(ii)_ ,
(ii) the obligation of Parent under _Section 5.18(d)_, (iii) the obligation
of Parent under _Section 5.18(e)_, (iv) the obligation of Parent under 
_Section 5.18(f)_, or (v) the obligation of Parent under _Sections 5.7(a)_
and _5.7(b)_. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other
Person shall be required to prove the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy
or obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with
or as a condition to obtaining any remedy pursuant to this _Section 10.4_,
and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require
the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.
Each Party further agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise
in response to any action for equitable relief as permitted pursuant to this 
_Section 10.4_ is that it contests the existence of a breach of this
Agreement. While PGP and the Company may elect to pursue either or both of (i)
a grant of specific performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted
by this  _Section 10.4,_ or (ii) the payment of the Parent Termination Fee
(only to the extent expressly permitted by _Section 8.3_), under no
circumstances shall PGP or the Company be permitted or entitled to receive
both such grant of specific performance and payment of the Parent Termination
Fee. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event of a breach
by Parent of its obligations under _Section 5.18(d), Section 5.18(e) _or 
_Section 5.18(f)_, on the Parent Funding Date (but prior to the Drop Dead
Date), PGP and the Companys sole and exclusive remedy shall be to enforce
specifically the obligation of Parent under _Section 5.18(d), Section
5.18(e)_ and _Section 5.18(f). _

10.5 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, except as
otherwise provided herein, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the Merger, including all legal, accounting, tax and financial advisory,
consulting, investment banking and all other fees 

 



116   and expenses of third Parties incurred by a Party in connection with the
negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be the obligation of the Party
incurring such fees and expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Merger
is consummated, all Company Transaction Expenses shall be treated as provided
in _Section 2.2_.

 

10.6 _Successors and Assigns; Parties in Interest_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon each of the Member and each of their
respective personal representatives, executors, administrators, estates,
heirs, successors and assigns (if any) and Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and
the Surviving Company and their respective successors and assigns, if any.
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and the Indemnified
Parties and the respective successors and assigns (if any) of the foregoing.

(b) No Party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations
under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent and the
Company.

(c) Except as provided in the following sentences, nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
rights, interests, benefits or other remedies of any nature under or by
reason of this Agreement. If the Merger is consummated: (i) this Agreement is
intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties and, each Indemnified Party shall
be deemed a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement and this Agreement
shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties; (ii) _Section 2.7(a)_ is
intended to benefit PGP Advisors, LLC, and PGP Advisors, LLC shall be deemed a
third party beneficiary of _Section 2.7(a)_ and  _Section 2.7(a)_ shall be
enforceable by PGP Advisors, LLC; (iii) _Section 2.7(b)_ is intended to
benefit Michael Luzich, and Michael Luzich shall be deemed a third party
beneficiary of _Section 2.7(b)_ and  _Section 2.7(b)_ shall be enforceable
by Michael Luzich; and (vi) the Parent Financing Sources are hereby made third
party beneficiaries of _Section 5.18_, _Section 8.3_, this _Section 10.6_
and  _Section 10.10_. Except as set forth in this _Section 10.6(c)_, none
of the provisions of this Agreement are intended to provide any rights or
remedies to any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns, if any.

10.7 _Amendment_. Except as is otherwise required by applicable Law, prior to
the Closing, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time by
execution of an instrument in writing signed by Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company. Except as is otherwise required by applicable Law, after the Closing,
this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time by execution of an
instrument in writing signed by Parent and the Member.

10.8 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub, as applicable, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other,
may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations of the other Party, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such Party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such
Party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if, and to the extent, set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by such Party.

 



117  10.9 _No Additional Waiver_. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise
any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on
the part of any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right,
privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power,
right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy.

 

10.10 _Governing Law; Venue_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without
regard to any conflicts of laws principles thereof. The Parties irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan of the city of New York for the purposes of any action
arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
and each of the Parties agrees that it will not bring or support any action,
whether in law or in equity, in any forum other than the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate
courts thereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that if such federal courts do not
have jurisdiction over such action, such action shall be heard and determined
exclusively in any New York state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan
in the city of New York. The Parties further agree that service of any
process, summons, notice or document hand delivered or sent by U.S. registered
mail to such Partys respective address set forth in  _Section 10.1_ shall
be effective service of process for any action in New York with respect to any
matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence. The Parties irrevocably and unconditionally
waive any objection to the laying of venue of any action arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in (i) the federal courts
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if such federal courts do not have jurisdiction over such
action, such action shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York
state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the city of New York, and
hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such action brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
waives any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out
of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the
actions of the Member, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support
any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any
kind or description, whether in law or in equity, against the Parent
Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to any dispute
arising out of or relating to the Parent Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, County of New York, or if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts thereof).

10.11 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such Party, as applicable, and the exercise by a Party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 



118  10.12 _Counterparts; Facsimile Delivery_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any signature
page delivered by facsimile or electronic image transmission shall be binding
to the same extent as an original signature page. Any Party that delivers a
signature page by facsimile or electronic image transmission shall deliver an
original counterpart to any other Party that requests such original
counterpart.

 

10.13 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. The Parties agree that they
have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or document. 

10.14 _No Joint Venture_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed
or construed as creating a joint venture or partnership between any of the
Parties. No Party is by virtue of this Agreement authorized as an agent,
employee or legal representative of any other Party. No Party by virtue of
this Agreement shall have the power to control the activities and operations
of any other Party and their status is, and at all times shall continue to be,
that of independent contractors with respect to each other. No Party by virtue
of this Agreement shall have any power or authority to bind or commit any
other Party. No Party shall hold itself out as having any authority or
relationship in contravention of this _Section 10.14_. No Party by virtue of
this Agreement owes a fiduciary duty or express or implied duty to any other
Party, but instead the Parties intend their contractual relationship to be
governed by the express provisions of this Agreement.
