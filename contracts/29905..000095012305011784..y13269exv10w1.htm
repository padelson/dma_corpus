 WHEREAS, the Buyer desires to purchase, and the Sellers desire to sell to the Buyer, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), Series A-1 Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Series A-1 Preferred Stock_ "), and Series A-2 Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Series A-2 Preferred Stock_", and together with the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the " _Preferred Stock_ "), of Knowles; and 

   

 WHEREAS, the Sellers collectively own, beneficially and of record, all of the issued and outstanding Common Stock and Preferred Stock (collectively, the " _Knowles Shares_ ").

ARTICLE II 

   

PURCHASE AND SALE 

   

 Section 2.1 _Purchase and Sale of the Knowles Shares_. 

   

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, each Seller shall sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase, acquire and accept from each Seller, the Knowles Shares owned by such Seller as set forth on the _Purchase Price Disbursement Schedule_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) In consideration for the sale, transfer and conveyance of the Knowles Shares by the Sellers to the Buyer and for the cancellation of the Options, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers an aggregate amount in cash equal to the sum of (i) $750,000,000 (the " _Purchase Price_ "), less (ii) the Closing Date Debt Obligation Amount, less (iii) the amount of the Transaction Expenses, plus (iv) the amount of Cash as of immediately prior to the Closing (such sum, the " _Equity Purchase Price_ "). 

  

 (c) Knowles shall deliver to the Buyer, not less than three (3) Business Days before the Closing Date, a schedule (the " _Purchase Price Disbursement Schedule_ ") which shall accurately set forth (i) the calculation of the Closing Date Debt Obligation Amount, (ii) the calculation of the Transaction Expenses, (iii) each Sellers ownership of Knowles Shares as of the Closing Date, (iv) each Optionholders ownership of Options as of the Closing Date, and (iv) any payments to be made to each such Seller or Optionholder pursuant to Section 2.2 herein, together with a certificate signed by an executive officer of Knowles specifying the Closing Date Debt Obligation Amount and the amount of Transaction Expenses; _provided_ , that such _Purchase Price Disbursement Schedule_ together with such certificate shall, to the extent necessary, be updated by Knowles on the Closing Date to reflect the actual amounts owed on such date. 

  

 Section 2.2 _Payment of Purchase Price_. Concurrent with the Closing, the Buyer shall pay the Purchase Price, by wire transfer of immediately available funds as follows: 

   

 (a) to such account or accounts as Knowles specifies, in order to pay and discharge such obligations, an amount equal to the Closing Date Debt Obligation Amount, less the Closing Date Public Notes Obligation Amount; 

  

 (b) to such account of the Trustee (as such term is defined in the Indenture) as Knowles specifies, in order to pay and discharge such obligations, an amount equal to the Closing Date Public Notes Obligation Amount; 

  

 (c) to such account or accounts as Knowles specifies, in order to pay and discharge such expenses, an amount equal to the Transaction Expenses; 

  

 (d) to such account or accounts as the Sellers Representative specifies, in consideration for the sale, transfer and conveyance of the shares of Preferred Stock set forth opposite such Sellers name on the _Purchase Price Disbursement Schedule_ , an amount equal to the product of (i) the percentage (representing the proportion which such number of shares of Preferred Stock bears to the aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of the Closing Date) set forth opposite such Sellers name on the _Purchase Price Disbursement Schedule_  multiplied by (ii) the Preferred Consideration. The " _Preferred Consideration_ " shall equal the sum of (i) $1,000 multiplied by the aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock, plus (ii) all accumulated and all accrued and unpaid or unaccumulated dividends on the Preferred Stock through the Closing Date; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) to such account or accounts as the Sellers Representative specifies, in consideration for the sale, transfer and conveyance of the shares of Common Stock set forth opposite such Sellers name on the _Purchase Price Disbursement Schedule_ , an amount equal to (i) the percentage (representing the proportion which such number of shares of Common Stock bears to the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Closing Date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of all 2004 Options) set forth opposite such Sellers name on the _Purchase Price Disbursement Schedule_ multiplied by (ii) the Common Consideration. The " _Common Consideration_ " shall equal (x) the Equity Purchase Price, minus (y) the Preferred Consideration, plus (z) the aggregate amount of cash which would be paid to Knowles upon the exercise of all outstanding 2004 Options (assuming payment in full of the exercise price of each such 2004 Option solely in cash); and 

  

 (f) to such account or accounts as the Sellers Representative specifies, in consideration for the cancellation of the 2004 Options, such 2004 Optionholders 2004 Option Cancellation Amount. 

  

 Each of the parties hereto required to provide account information to the Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.2 shall notify the Buyer in writing of such account information not less than three (3) Business Days before the Closing Date. Amounts paid in respect of the Optionholders shall be used, in part, to pay and discharge the obligations of Knowles set forth in Section 2.3 below at the Closing.

Knowles shall take all actions necessary or desirable so as to provide that immediately prior to the Closing Date, all outstanding options (the " _Options_ ") to purchase Common Stock held by any current or former employee or director of Knowles or any of its Subsidiaries (such Persons, collectively, the " _Optionholders_ " and each, an " _Optionholder_ ") granted under any stock option or stock purchase plan, program or arrangement of Knowles (collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ "), whether or not then exercisable, shall be entitled at the Closing to the consideration set forth in this Section 2.3, and such Options immediately thereafter shall be cancelled by Knowles. In consideration for such cancellation, (A) each 2004 Optionholder shall be entitled to receive, in consideration for the cancellation of the 2004 Options, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the price per share of Common Stock implied by Section 2.2(e) over (ii) the exercise price per share of each such 2004 Option, multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each such 2004 Option (such net amount, the " _2004 Option Cancellation Amount_ "), and (B) each 2001 Optionholder shall be entitled to receive, in consideration for the cancellation of the 2001 Options, an amount calculated in accordance with Section 7 of Knowles 2001 Stock Option Plan (such amount, the " _2001 Option Cancellation Amount_ "), in each case, reduced by applicable withholding Tax or other amounts required to be withheld by law. The Buyer shall cause Knowles to deliver payment of all 2001 Option Cancellation Amounts to each 2001 Optionholder pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and all 2004 Option Cancellation Amounts to each 2004 Optionholder pursuant to Section 2.2(f), as applicable, at the Closing. Each Optionholder shall deliver to Knowles written confirmation signed by 

    #####

 (ii) With respect to any welfare benefit plans maintained for the benefit of Knowles Employees on and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition limitations and waiting periods and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations for the year in which the Closing Date occurs, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, such employees under similar Knowles Plans in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 Section 7.8 _FIRPTA Certificate_.

 Section 7.9 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

In addition, the Buyer shall cause Knowles to maintain in effect for the duration of the period of six (6) years commencing on the Closing Date directors and officers liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by Knowles directors and officers liability insurance policy with coverage limits not lower in any respect than, and otherwise on terms no less favorable to the insured parties than, Knowles insurance coverage as in effect on the date hereof.

This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Sellers associated and connected persons (as those terms are defined in Sections 249 and 435 of the Insolvency Act 1986).

Without limiting the foregoing, (i) each Seller, jointly and severally, hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers Representative and its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents from and against all expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel), losses, claims, fines, liabilities, damages, judgments or amounts paid in settlement in respect of any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, based on, arising out of or relating to the fact that such Person is or was a Sellers Representative hereunder or arising out of acts or omissions of such Person in such capacity occurring on or prior to the Closing (including in respect of acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby).

 (a) Parent, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, hereby, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Sellers, for the benefit of the Sellers and their respective successors, transferees and assigns, the prompt and complete performance by the Buyer of all of its covenants, agreements, obligations and liabilities under or pursuant to this Agreement, whether fixed, contingent, now existing or hereafter arising, created, assumed, incurred or acquired, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the obligation of the Buyer to pay the Purchase Price and any other amounts that may be payable by the Buyer under or in connection with the Purchase Agreement (collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). Until satisfaction in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, Parent expressly waives any and all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnity, exoneration, contribution or any other claim which Parent may now or hereafter have against the Sellers arising from the existence or performance of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) The obligations of Parent hereunder are independent of the obligations of Buyer with respect to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations and, in the event of any default hereunder, a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Parent.

Buyer acknowledges the matters set forth on _Schedule 10.15_ and agrees (x) that it is purchasing Knowles subject to all liabilities arising from these disclosed matters and (y) that such liabilities, if any, shall not result in the failure to satisfy any condition to the obligations of the Buyer set forth in Section 8.1 or, for the avoidance of doubt, any liability on the part of the Sellers.
