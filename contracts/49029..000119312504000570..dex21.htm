(d) Each Company Common Share shall be converted into a right to receive, upon
surrender of the certificate representing such Company Common Share, cash
equal to the Common Share Price.



(e) Each Company Option that is outstanding and vested immediately prior to
or as of the Effective Time (including as a result of the acceleration of the
vesting and exercisability of such Company Option pursuant to its terms),
shall be cancelled in exchange for a single lump sum cash payment, to be paid
by the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Closing upon
its receipt of a release in the form of _Exhibit A_ attached hereto, equal to
the product of (i) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such
Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Common Share Price at the
Effective Time over the exercise price per share of such Company Option,
subject to any required withholding of Taxes, and less such holders
proportionate share of (A) the Net Assets Holdback and, (B) with respect to
the holders of Company Shares listed in _Schedule 2.6(c)_ attached hereto, the
Stockholder Holdback (as defined in Section 2.6(c) below), in each case based
on the sum of the number of Company Common Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Closing plus the number of Company Common Shares issuable upon
the exercise of the Company Options outstanding and vested immediately prior
to or as of the Closing.



(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but only to
the extent required by the DGCL, and subject to Section 5.10 below, Company
Common Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and are held by Persons who comply with all the provisions of
the DGCL concerning appraisal rights for the fair value of their Company
Common Shares in connection with the Merger (the _"Dissenting Stockholders"_ )
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Common Share Price but
shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to
be due such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.



2.5 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Preliminary Purchase Price shall be
subject to adjustment according to this Section 2.5.



(a) At least five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to the Buyer a good faith written estimate of the Net Assets
Amount as of the Closing Date (the _"Estimated Closing Date Net Assets Amount_
"), which shall be subject to  



 

8  the Buyers review. The Estimated Closing Date Net Assets Amount shall be
prepared in accordance with _Schedule 1.1(a)_ and GAAP and using the
same accounting principles, practices and methodologies that were used to
prepare the Most Recent Balance Sheet (and the Companys delivery of the
Estimated Closing Date Net Assets Amount to the Buyer shall include supporting
schedules of the type prepared in connection with the Most Recent Balance
Sheet). If the Estimated Closing Date Net Assets Amount is greater than the
Target Net Assets Amount, the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be increased by
such amount. If the Estimated Closing Date Net Assets Amount is less than the
Target Net Assets Amount, the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be reduced by
such amount. The Company will also deliver to the Buyer, at least five (5)
business days prior to the Closing Date, a certificate setting forth an
estimate of the Indebtedness and the Company and Stockholder Transaction
Expenses as of the Closing Date.



(b) Within twenty (20) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer will prepare and
deliver to the Stockholders Representative a balance sheet of the Company as
of the Closing Date (the " _Final Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "), including a
calculation of the Net Assets Amount as of the Closing Date (the _"Closing
Date Net Assets Amount"_ ). The Final Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be
prepared in accordance with _Schedule 1.1(a)_ and GAAP and using the same
accounting principles, practices and methodologies that were used to prepare
the Most Recent Balance Sheet.



(c) The Stockholders Representative shall have a period commencing upon
delivery of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet by Buyer and expiring ten
(10) days after such delivery date to review the Final Closing Date Balance
Sheet. The Stockholders Representative shall have full access during regular
business hours and upon reasonable notice to all relevant books and records
and employees of the Surviving Corporation to the extent necessary to complete
its review of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet in a manner not
unreasonably interfering with the business of the Surviving Corporation. In
the event the Stockholders Representative disputes the determination of the
Closing Date Net Assets Amount, the Stockholders Representative shall, within
ten (10) days after delivery of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet, deliver
a notice to the Buyer (the _"Adjustment Dispute Notice"_ ), setting forth in
reasonable detail the component or components which are in dispute and the
basis of such dispute. If the Stockholders Representative fails to deliver
an Adjustment Dispute Notice to Buyer within ten (10) days after Buyers
delivery of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet, then the Significant
Stockholders and the other holders of the Company Common Shares and the
Company Options shall be bound by the calculation of the Closing Date Net
Assets Amount that accompanied the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet prepared
by Buyer, and the Closing Date Net Assets Amount shall be deemed to be the
Final Closing Date Net Assets Amount, and any required payments shall be made
pursuant to Section 2.5(e) below based on such Final Closing Date Net Assets
Amount. If the Stockholders Representative delivers the Adjustment Dispute
Notice within such ten (10) day period, then the Buyer and the Stockholders
Representative will use reasonable efforts to resolve any such dispute within
ten (10) days after receipt by the Buyer of the Adjustment Dispute Notice. If
the Buyer and the Stockholders Representative fail to resolve any such
dispute within ten (10) days after receipt by the Buyer of the Adjustment
Dispute Notice, they shall submit the dispute to Ernst and Young LLP (the
_"Reviewing Accountant"_ ) to review the Closing Date Net Assets Amount set
forth on the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet. The Buyer and the Stockholders
Representative shall make available to the Reviewing Accountant all work
papers and all other information and material in their possession relating to
the matters in the Adjustment Dispute Notice. The Reviewing Accountant shall
be instructed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver its
determination as promptly as practicable after such submission of the dispute
to the Reviewing Accountant.  



 

9  The Parties hereby expressly agree that the determination of the Reviewing
Accountant shall be final and binding on the parties (absent fraud or manifest
bad faith by the Reviewing Accountant). The Closing Date Net Assets Amount on
the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet as determined by the Buyer (if not
disputed), or as modified (if at all) by agreement of the Buyer and the
Stockholders Representative or by decision of the Reviewing Accountant,
shall be the _"Final Closing Date Net Assets Amount"_. Each Party shall bear
its own expenses and the fees and expenses of its own representatives and
experts, including its independent accountants, in connection with the
preparation, review, dispute (if any) and final determination of the Final
Closing Date Net Assets Amount, and such fees and expenses of the holders of
the Company Shares shall be paid, if necessary, from the Net Assets Holdback.
The costs, expenses and fees of the Reviewing Accountant shall be borne by the
holders of the Company Shares, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other
hand, based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to such Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party
(and which, in the case of the holders of the Company Shares, shall be paid,
if necessary, from the Net Assets Holdback).



(d) Within ten (10) days after the Final Closing Date Net Assets Amount has
become final and binding on the parties pursuant to Section 2.5(c), the
Preliminary Purchase Price will be adjusted as follows (the Preliminary
Purchase Price as so adjusted is referred to as the _"Purchase Price"_ ): 



(i) If the Final Closing Date Net Assets Amount is greater than the sum of
(A) the Estimated Closing Date Net Assets Amount plus (B) $100,000, the Buyer
shall pay to the Stockholders Representative (for the benefit of the holders
of the Company Common Shares and Company Options), by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to the account designated by the Stockholders
Representative, an amount equal to such excess, which amount will be allocated
(after reducing such amount by the fees and expenses incurred by such holders
pursuant to the last two sentences of Section 2.5(c) above) among and
distributed by the Stockholders Representative to the holders of the Company
Common Shares and Company Options in proportion to their respective holdings
of the Company Common Shares (calculated on an as-converted basis) as of the
Closing.



(ii) If the Final Closing Date Net Assets Amount is less than the difference
between (A) Estimated Closing Date Net Assets Amount minus (B) $100,000, the
Stockholders Representative shall pay to the Buyer, by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to the accounts designated by the Buyer, an amount
equal to such deficit (which shall not be limited to the Net
Assets Holdback).



(e) Any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.5 will bear interest from
and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at the
Applicable Rate.



(f) The Stockholders Representative agrees that it shall retain, and not
distribute to its general or limited partners, or to the holders of the
Company Common Shares or the Company Options, $3,000,000 of the Preliminary
Purchase Price (the _"Net Assets Holdback"_ ) until the Final Closing Date Net
Assets Amount has become final and binding on the Parties pursuant to Section
2.5(c) and all amounts required to be paid by the Stockholders Representative
or the Buyer pursuant to Section 2.5(d) have been paid in full. The
Stockholders Representative will pay any Company and Stockholder Transaction
Expenses exceeding the estimate thereof from the Net Assets Holdback and/or
the Stockholder Holdback.



 

10 2.6 _Method of Payment._ __



(a) The Buyer shall act as its own paying agent under this Agreement for
purposes of distributing the Preliminary Purchase Price and the Preferred
Share Amount as contemplated hereby. On the Closing Date the Buyer shall
segregate (and, in the case of the Company Options, cause the Surviving
Corporation to segregate) into a separate account monies in an amount equal
to the Preliminary Purchase Price and the Preferred Share Amount and shall
hold the same for the holders of the Company Shares and the Company Options
under this Agreement.



(b) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, and from time to time
following the exercise of any Company Options prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall send to each holder of Company Common Shares a letter of
transmittal from such holder to the Buyer in substantially the form of
_Exhibit B_  attached hereto (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") stating:



(i) that payment of the Common Share Price or Preferred Share Price, as
applicable, payable to such holder shall be made against and only upon
delivery to the Buyer by such holder of the certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company
Shares (the _"Certificates"_ ) owned by such Person;



(ii) that risk of loss and title to the Certificates and other items required
to be delivered by the holder shall pass only upon delivery of such items to
the Buyer, and that all such items the form of which is not attached hereto
shall be in customary form, including such customary provisions as the
Surviving Corporation or the Buyer reasonably may specify in its written
instructions for use by the holders of the Company Shares in effecting the
surrender to the Buyer of such items.



(c) Following the execution and delivery to the Buyer of a Letter of
Transmittal by a holder of Company Shares accompanied by the Certificates, at
the Closing the Buyer shall pay (or, if such execution and delivery occurs
after the Closing, the Buyer shall pay within three (3) business days) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by
the holder of Company Shares in its Letter of Transmittal the Common Share
Price or Preferred Share Price, as applicable, deliverable in respect thereof,
less (i) such holders proportionate share of the Net Assets Holdback (based
on the sum of the number of Company Common Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Closing plus the number of Company Common Shares issuable upon
the exercise of the Company Options outstanding and vested immediately prior
to or as of the Closing), which amount shall be delivered at the Closing by
the Buyer to the Stockholders Representative by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated by the Stockholders Representative
to hold in accordance with Section 2.5(f) above and (ii) with respect to the
holders of Company Shares listed in _Schedule 2.6(c)_ attached hereto, such
holders share of $8,890,051 (or such different amount as is requested in
writing by the Stockholders Representative from the Buyer) (the
_"Stockholder Holdback"_ ), which share of such amount shall be calculated
using the percentages set forth next to each such holders name in _Schedule
2.6(c)_ , and which amount shall be delivered at the Closing by the Buyer to
the Stockholders Representative by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account designated by the Stockholders Representative. Until so
surrendered, each Certificate shall be deemed, for all corporate purposes, to
evidence only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount to which
such Person is entitled pursuant to this Section 2. No interest shall be paid
or accrued in respect of any cash payments made hereunder.



 

11 (d) If the Common Share Price or Preferred Share Price (or any portion
thereof) is to be delivered to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it shall be
a condition to the payment of such amount that the Certificates so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and
otherwise in proper form for transfer, that such transfer otherwise be proper
and that the Person requesting such transfer pay to the Buyer any transfer or
other Taxes payable by reason of the foregoing or establish to the
satisfaction of the Buyer that such Taxes have been paid or are not required
to be paid.



(e) At and after the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate representing
Company Shares shall cease to have any rights as a stockholder of the
Company, except for the right to surrender its Certificate in exchange for
payment of the Common Share Price or Preferred Share Price, as applicable. No
transfer of Company Shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation. Certificates presented to the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Common Share Price or Preferred Share Price, as applicable, as provided in
this Section 2. At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time the
stock ledger of the Company with respect to Company Shares shall be closed.



(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Buyer shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the amount deliverable in
respect thereof as determined in accordance with this Section 2, provided that
the Person to whom such amount is paid shall, as a condition precedent to the
payment thereof, indemnify the Surviving Corporation in a manner satisfactory
to it against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation
with respect to the Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.



(g) The Buyer shall make no distribution of a Dissenting Stockholders Common
Share Price unless and until the validity of such claim as a Dissenting
Stockholder (subject to Section 5.10 below) has been determined and the fair
value of a Dissenting Stockholders Company Common Shares has been determined
for any Dissenting Stockholder in the manner contemplated by Section 262 of
the DGCL. At that time, the Buyer shall pay to the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation from the segregated fund established under Section 2.6(a) above
the Common Share Price for the Dissenting Stockholders Company Common Shares
and, subject to Section 8.2(e) below, the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation shall pay from its own funds the fair value of such Dissenting
Stockholders Company Common Shares.



(h) Any portion of the segregated Preliminary Purchase Price or Preferred
Share Amount on deposit with the Buyer that remains undistributed for one
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to or as directed by Buyer,
upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied
with this Section 2 shall thereafter look only to Buyer (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar legal requirements) as a general creditor
for payment of their claim for the same, with such sums to be paid only upon
compliance by such holder of Company Shares with all conditions to payment of
the same specified in this Section 2.

its assets), other than termination of the waiting period under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Act, as well as such violations, conflicts, defaults,
accelerations, rights, notices or consents under subparagraphs (a) or (b)

Subsidiaries holds of record and owns beneficially all of the outstanding
shares of each Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any restrictions
on transfer (other than restrictions under the Securities Act and state
securities laws), Taxes, Security Interests, options, warrants, purchase
rights, contracts, commitments, equities, claims, and demands. There are no
outstanding or authorized options, warrants, purchase rights, conversion
rights, exchange rights, or other contracts or commitments that could require
any of the Company and its Subsidiaries to sell, transfer, or
otherwise dispose of any capital stock of any of its Subsidiaries or that
could require any Subsidiary of the Company to issue, sell, or otherwise cause
to become outstanding any of its own capital stock. There are no outstanding
stock appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation, or similar rights
with respect to any Subsidiary of the Company. There are no voting trusts,
proxies, or other agreements or understandings with respect to the voting of

4.7 _Financial Statements._ Attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ are the following
financial statements (collectively the _"Financial Statements"_ ): (a) audited
consolidated balance  



 

16  sheets and statements of income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash
flow as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2000, December
31, 2001, and December 31, 2002 (the _"Most Recent Fiscal Year End"_ ) for
the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (b) unaudited consolidated balance
sheets and statements of income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash
flow (the  _"Most Recent Financial Statements"_ ) as of and for the nine

the Company and its Subsidiaries. Prior to the Closing, the Company will
deliver to the Buyer, within twenty (20) days after each month end, copies of
such monthly financial statements as it customarily prepares in the Ordinary
Course of Business. The Financial Statements (including the notes thereto)
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods covered thereby, present fairly in all material
respects the financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
such dates and the results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for such periods and are consistent with the books and records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (which books and records are materially correct and

claim for indemnification against any other Party (the _"Indemnifying Party"_
) under this Section 8, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify each
Indemnifying Party thereof in writing; provided, however, that no delay on the
part of the Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying Party shall
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then
solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party thereby is prejudiced.



(b) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the Indemnified Party
against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party so long as (i) the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party in writing within 15 days after the Indemnified Party has
given notice of the Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party will
indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the entirety of any Adverse
Consequences the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of,
relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim to which the
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, (ii) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party
with evidence acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party
will have the financial resources to defend against the Third Party Claim and
fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder, (iii) the  



 

41  Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an
injunction or other equitable relief, (iv) settlement of, or an adverse
judgment with respect to, the Third Party Claim is not, in the good faith
judgment of the Indemnified Party, likely to establish a precedential custom
or practice materially adverse to the continuing business interests of the
Indemnified Party, and (v) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the
Third Party Claim actively and diligently.



(c) So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the Third

Party, which will not be unreasonably withheld, (ii) the Indemnifying Parties
will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and periodically for the costs
of defending against the Third Party Claim (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses), and (iii) the Indemnifying Parties will remain responsible

arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party
Claim to the fullest extent provided in this Section 8.

provisions of this Section 8 unless and only to the extent that the amount of
all such Adverse Consequences equals or exceeds $1,750,000 (the _"Indemnity
Deductible"_ ) in the aggregate, in which case the Buyer shall be entitled to
indemnification only for such excess;



_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing limitations in Sections 8.5(a)
shall not apply to Adverse Consequences (i) in respect of the breach by the
Company or any Significant Stockholder of any of the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6, (ii) in
respect of claims made pursuant to Section 8.2(b), 8.2(c), or 8.2(e), or (iii)

Consequences not exceeding an indemnity cap (the " _Indemnity Cap_ ") of (i)
$70,000,000, as to all indemnity claims made by the Buyer on or before the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, and (ii) $10,000,000, as to all
indemnity claims made by the Buyer after the first anniversary of the Closing
Date and during the applicable survival period;

warranties set forth in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6, (ii) in
respect of claims made pursuant to Section 8.2(b), 8.2(c), or 8.2(e), or

42 8.6 _Determination of Adverse Consequences._ Any amounts required to be paid
to an Indemnified Party pursuant to the terms of this Section 8 shall be (i)
reduced by the amount of any Tax benefits reasonably anticipated to be
received by the Indemnified Party during the period after Closing and
increased by the amount of any increase in Taxes payable by the Indemnified
Party with respect to such amounts required to be paid to an Indemnified Party
pursuant to the terms of this Section 8 and (ii) reduced by any amount
actually received by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies, less any
retrospective premium obligations, experience-based premium obligations, other
indemnification obligations and the present value of any reasonably
anticipated increase in insurance premiums on account of such Adverse
Consequences; provided, that the Indemnified Party shall refund to the
Indemnifying Party the amount of any increase in insurance premiums which are
not incurred. The Parties shall take into account the time cost of money
(using the Applicable Rate as the discount rate) in determining Adverse
Consequences for purposes of this Section 8. All indemnification payments
under this Section 8 shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase Price.



8.7 _Other Indemnification Provisions._ After the Closing, the right of the

members, shareholders, officers and directors) to indemnification pursuant to
Section 8 of this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive right and remedy
exercisable against any other party to this Agreement; provided, however,
that this sentence shall not apply in cases of (i) fraud or (ii) intentional
misrepresentation.



8.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification. ___



(a) The indemnification provisions of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation as in effect at the Effective Time shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals who at the Effective Time were directors or
officers of the Company with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time, unless such modification is required by law. The Buyer
shall insure that the Surviving Corporation honors and performs its
obligations under the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and
bylaws. In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Surviving Corporation, the Buyer agrees to assume the obligation of
the Surviving Corporation under its certificate of incorporation. At its
election, the Stockholders Representative will obtain tail directors and
officers liability insurance coverage for such period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time, and, if such election is made, the Buyer will reimburse
the Stockholders Representative for up to $130,000 of such expense.



(b) In the event the Surviving Corporation or its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made by the
Buyer so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume the obligations set out in this Section 8.8.

reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 8.8.



 

43 (d) The rights of each director, former director, officer and former officer
of the Company (" _D andO Indemnified Persons_") hereunder shall be in addition
to any other rights such DandO Indemnified Person may have under the charter or
bylaws of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, under the DGCL
or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 8.8 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the
DandO Indemnified Persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer may cause
the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws to be
modified to reflect the agreement of the Parties that any obligation that the
Surviving Corporation may have, whether under the certificate of
incorporation, the bylaws or otherwise, to indemnify the DandO Indemnified
Parties:



(i) shall not apply to any action taken by any DandO Indemnified Person in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;



(ii) shall not restrict in any manner the rights of the Buyer pursuant to this
Section 8 or require the Company to indemnify DandO Indemnified Persons from
any proper claim brought by the Buyer thereunder.



(e) Each of the Significant Stockholders hereby agrees that he or it will not
make any claim for indemnification against any of the Company and its
Subsidiaries by reason of the fact that he or it was a director, officer,
employee, or agent of any such entity or was serving at the request of any
such entity as a partner, trustee, director, officer, employee, or agent of
another entity (whether such claim is for judgments, damages, penalties,
fines, costs, amounts paid in settlement, losses, expenses, or otherwise and
whether such claim is pursuant to any statute, charter document, bylaw,
agreement, or otherwise) with respect to any action, suit, proceeding,
complaint, claim, or demand brought in good faith by the Buyer against such
Significant Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement.

the Stockholders Representative of the breach, and the breach has continued
without cure for a period of 15 days after the notice of breach or (ii) if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before February 2, 2004, by reason of

be extended to March 31, 2004 if the failure relates to the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Act; and

2004 if the failure relates to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

this Agreement will terminate, except that the obligations in Sections 10.12

terminated by a Party because of the willful breach of the Agreement by
another Party or because one or more of the conditions to the terminating
Partys obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of
another Partys willful failure to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement, the terminating Partys right to pursue all legal remedies will
survive such termination unimpaired.

10.9  _Governing Law_.



(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
domestic laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.



(b) The parties hereto agree that any action, suit or proceeding (a "
_Proceeding_ ") arising out of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be commenced and litigated exclusively in the United States
District for the District of Delaware or in a state court of the State of
Delaware.



(c) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state
courts in the State of Delaware for any Proceeding (and each such party agrees
not to commence any Proceeding, except in such courts), (ii) waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any Proceeding in the courts of the State
of Delaware, and (iii) waives, and agrees not to plead or to make, any claim
that any Proceeding brought in any court of the State of Delaware has been
brought in an improper or otherwise inconvenient forum.



 

47 (d) Each Party hereto hereby irrevocably designates and appoints R,L and F
Service Corp. at One Rodney Square, Wilmington, Delaware 19801 (hereinafter
called the " _Agent_ "), as its attorney-in-fact to receive service of process
in such Proceeding, it being agreed that service upon such attorney-in-fact
shall constitute valid service upon each such party or its successors or
assigns, and each party agrees that (i) the sole responsibilities of the Agent
shall be (x) to receive such process, (y) to send a copy of any such process
so received to such party, by registered airmail, return receipt requested,
at the address set out in Section 10.8 of this Agreement, or at the last
address filed in writing by such party with the Agent and (z) to give prompt
telegraphic notice of receipt thereof to such party at such address, and (ii)
the Agent shall have no responsibility for the receipt or non-receipt by such
party of such process, nor for any performance or non-performance by such
party, or any other party to this Agreement or their successors or assigns.
The Company hereby agrees to pay to the Agent such compensation as shall be
agreed upon from time to time for services of the Agent hereunder. Each Party
hereby agrees that its submission to jurisdiction and its designation of the
Agent set out above is made for the express benefit of each of the Parties
hereto. Each Party further covenants and agrees that so long as this Agreement
shall be in effect, such Party shall maintain a duly appointed agent for the
service of summonses and other legal processes in Wilmington, Delaware and
will notify the other Parties hereto of the name and address of such agent if
it is no longer the Agent.



10.10 _Amendments and Waivers._ No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
the Buyer and the Stockholders Representative. No waiver by any Party of any
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty, covenant or agreement
hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior
or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty, covenant or
agreement hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any
prior or subsequent such occurrence.



10.11 _Severability._ Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction.



10.12 _Expenses._ Each of the Parties will bear his or its own costs and
expenses (including legal and advisory fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Buyer will pay the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing fee. The Company and
Stockholder Transaction Expenses shall reduce the Purchase Price hereunder as
set forth in the definition of Preliminary Purchase Price above. The
Significant Stockholders agree that none of the Company and its Subsidiaries
has borne or will bear any of the costs and expenses of the Company and the
Significant Stockholders (including any of their legal and advisory fees and
expenses) in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.



10.13 _Construction._ The Parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state,
local, or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires
otherwise. The word "including" shall mean including without limitation. The
Parties  



 

48  intend that each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement contained
herein shall have independent significance. If any Party has breached
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) which the Party has not breached shall not detract
from or mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach of the first
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.



10.14 _Specific Performance._ Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
the other Parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties
agrees that the other Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any
action instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof
having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter (subject to the
provisions set forth in Section 10.9 above), in addition to any other remedy
to which they may be entitled, at law or in equity.



10.15 _Attorneys  Fees._ In the event any litigation arises out of or in
connection with this Agreement, the prevailing Party in such litigation will
be entitled to recover from the other Party or Parties to such litigation all
reasonable attorneys fees, expenses and litigation costs, including those
associated with any appellate or post-judgment collection proceeding.



10.16 _Stockholders  Representative_.



(a) The Company and the Significant Stockholders hereby authorize, direct and
appoint the Stockholders Representative to act as sole and exclusive agent,
attorney-in-fact and representative of the Significant Stockholders and the
other holders of Company Shares and Company Options, with full power of
substitution with respect to all matters under this Agreement, including,
without limitation, determining, giving and receiving notices and processes
hereunder, receiving certain distributions of the Common Share Price to or
for the benefit of the holders of the Company Shares and the Company Options,
entering into any documents required or permitted under Section 8, contesting
and settling any and all claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 8
hereof, resolving any other disputes hereunder, performing the duties
expressly assigned to the Stockholders Representative hereunder and to engage
and employ agents and representatives and to incur such other expenses as
Stockholders Representative shall reasonably deem necessary or prudent in
connection with the foregoing. The Stockholders Representative shall have the
sole and exclusive right on behalf of any Significant Stockholder to take any
action or provide any waiver, or receive any notice with respect to any
claims for indemnification under Section 8 and to settle any claim or
controversy arising with respect thereto. Any such actions taken, exercises of
rights, power or authority, and any decision or determination made by the
Stockholders Representative consistent herewith, shall be absolutely and
irrevocably binding on each Significant Stockholder as if such Significant
Stockholder personally had taken such action, exercised such rights, power or
authority or made such decision or determination in such Significant
Stockholders individual capacity, and no Significant Stockholders shall have
the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. Any
action required to be taken by the Significant Stockholders hereunder or any
action which Significant Stockholders, at their election, have the right to
take hereunder, shall be taken only by the Stockholders Representative and no
Significant Stockholder acting on its own shall be entitled to take any such
action. All deliveries and payments to be made by the Buyer to the
Stockholders Representative pursuant to Sections 2.3(c) and 2.5(d) above
shall be made on behalf of the holders of Company Common Shares and Company
 



 

49  Options and shall constitute full performance of the obligations of the
Buyer to the Stockholders Representative pursuant to such sections with
respect to such amounts. The Buyer shall not be liable for allocation of
particular deliveries and payments of such amounts by the Stockholders
Representative.



 

(b) The appointment of the Stockholders Representative as each Significant
Stockholders attorney-in-fact revokes any power of attorney heretofore
granted that authorized any other person or persons to represent such
Significant Stockholder with regard to this Agreement. The appointment of the
Stockholders Representative as attorney-in-fact pursuant hereto is coupled
with an interest and is irrevocable. The obligations of each Significant
Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement (i) will not be terminated by operation
of law, death, mental or physical incapacity, liquidation, dissolution,
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event with respect to such Significant
Stockholder or any proceeding in connection therewith, or in the case of a
trust, by the death of any trustee or trustees or the termination of such
trust, or any other event, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an
assignment by any Significant Stockholders of the whole or any fraction of its
interest in any payment due to it under this Agreement.



(c) The Stockholders Representative hereby accepts the foregoing appointment
and agrees to serve as Stockholders Representative, subject to the
provisions hereof, for the period of time from and after the date hereof
without compensation except for the reimbursement from the holders of the
Company Shares and the Company Options, out of the Net Assets Holdback or the
Stockholder Holdback, of reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by
Stockholders Representative in its capacity as such. Each of the Significant
Stockholders hereby acknowledges and agrees, that in appointing Stockholders
Representative as their representative pursuant to the terms and provisions of
this Section 10.16, and as specified herein, Stockholders Representative
shall not, in the absence of bad faith, willful misconduct or
gross negligence, have any liability to the Significant Stockholders
whatsoever with respect to its actions, decisions and determinations, and
shall be entitled to assume that all actions, decisions and determinations are
fully authorized by each and every one of the Significant Stockholders.



(d) The provisions of this Section 10.16 shall in no way impose any
obligations on the Buyer. In particular, notwithstanding any notice received
by the Buyer to the contrary and absent bad faith or willful misconduct, the
Buyer (i) shall be fully protected in relying upon and shall be entitled to
rely upon, shall have no liability to the Significant Stockholders with
respect to, actions, decisions and determinations of the Stockholders
Representative and (ii) shall be entitled to assume that all actions,
decisions and determinations of the Stockholders Representative are fully
authorized by all of the Significant Stockholders.



10.17 _Confidentiality_.



(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Buyer, the
Company and the Significant Stockholders will maintain in confidence, and
will cause their directors, officers, employees, agents, and advisors to
maintain in confidence, any written, oral, or other information obtained in
confidence from another Party or its Subsidiaries in connection with this
Agreement, unless (i) such information is already known to such Party or to
others not bound by a duty of confidentiality or such information becomes
publicly available through no fault of such Party, (ii) the use of such
information is necessary or appropriate in making any filing or obtaining any
consent or approval required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) the furnishing or use of such
information is required by legal proceedings.

 



 

50 (b) If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated,
each Party will return or destroy as much of such written information as the
other party may reasonably request.



(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Party
(and each employee, representative or other agent of any Party) may disclose
to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. Federal
income Tax treatment and U.S. Federal income Tax structure of any and all
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the _"Transactions"_ ) and
all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are
or have been provided to any Party (or to any employee, representative or
other agent of any such Party) relating to such Tax treatment or Tax
structure; provided, however, that such disclosure may not be made (i) until
the earlier of (x) the date of the public announcement of discussions relating
to the Transactions, (y) the date of the public announcement of the
Transactions and (z) the date of the execution of any agreement to enter into
the Transactions and (ii) to the extent required to be kept confidential to
comply with any applicable federal or state securities laws.
