following the latest to occur of (i) the receipt of all required Regulatory
Approvals, and the expiration of any applicable waiting periods, (ii) the
approval of the Merger by the stockholders of FSBI, (iii) the approval of the
Merger by the stockholders of PFS, or (iv) at such other date or time

Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. Except as provided in
Section 2.5, until changed in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, the officers of PFS
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of
Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified.



__2.5. _Additional Directors and Officers of PFS._



Effective as of the Effective Time, the number of persons constituting the
Board of Directors of PFS and The Provident Bank shall each be increased by
two (2) persons, and two (2) persons who are directors of FSBI

of PFS shall be appointed and elected to the PFS and The Provident Bank
Boards with a term of office expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders
to be held following the year ending December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively.
The Board of Directors of PFS and of The Provident Bank, or the nominating and
governance committee thereof, shall duly consider nominating such persons for
an additional three-year term in a manner consistent with its consideration of
other incumbent directors, provided that such persons continue to meet the
qualifications for election as a director of PFS and The Provident Bank. In
addition, during the calendar year 2005, the Board of Directors of PFS and of
The Provident Bank, or the nominating and governance committee thereof, shall
appoint either Christopher Martin or one of the members of the Advisory Board

__2.6. _Effects of the Merger._

forth in the DGCL.



__2.7. _Tax Consequences._



It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall
constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that term is used in Sections 354 and
361 of the Code. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the
Closing, each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Merger to qualify, and will not knowingly take any action, cause any action to
be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken
which action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Closing,
neither PFS, FSBI nor any of their affiliates shall knowingly take any
action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any
action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could cause the
Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Code. PFS and FSBI each hereby agrees to deliver certificates substantially
in compliance with IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with customary
exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable counsel to deliver the legal
opinions contemplated by Section 9.1.6, which certificates shall be effective

Merger described in Section 2.1 hereof, provided that (i) PFS shall have
received an opinion of counsel to PFS that there are no adverse Federal or
state income tax consequences to FSBI stockholders as a result of the
modification; (ii) the consideration to be paid to the holders of FSBI Common
Stock under this Agreement is not thereby changed in kind, value or reduced in
amount; and (iii) such modification will not delay materially or jeopardize
receipt of any required regulatory approvals or other consents and approvals
relating to the consummation of the Merger. The parties hereto agree to
appropriately amend this Agreement and any related documents in order to
reflect any such revised structure.



 

7 __2.9. _Additional Actions._



PFS shall execute any supplemental indentures and take such other actions as
shall be required pursuant to the Indentures, dated November 28, 2001,
between FSBI, as issuer, and Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee, in order
for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to conflict with or
result in a breach of such Indentures. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, PFS shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, assignments or
assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (i) vest,
perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in PFS its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of FSBI or
First Savings Bank, or (ii) otherwise carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, FSBI and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted
to PFS an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all such
deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts as are necessary or
desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in PFS its
right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or
assets of FSBI or (b) otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and
the officers and directors of the PFS are authorized in the name of FSBI or

ARTICLE III



CONVERSION OF SHARES



__3.1. _Conversion of FSBI Common Stock; Merger Consideration. _



At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of PFS, FSBI or the holders of any of the shares of FSBI Common Stock,
the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the following terms:



3.1.1. Each share of PFS Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.



3.1.2. All shares of FSBI Common Stock held in the treasury of FSBI and each
share of FSBI Common Stock owned by PFS or any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of PFS or of FSBI immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in connection with debts
previously contracted) ("Treasury Stock"), shall, at the Effective
Time, cease to exist, and the certificates for such shares shall be canceled
as promptly as practicable thereafter, and no payment or distribution shall be
made in consideration therefor.



3.1.3. Each share of FSBI Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Treasury Stock and Dissenting Shares)
shall become and be converted into, as provided in and subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement, the right to receive at the election
of the holder thereof as provided in Section 3.2 either (i) $22.25 in cash
(the "Cash Consideration"); (ii) 1.0920 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of PFS
Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration"); or (iii) a combination of the Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration, as provided in Section 3.2 (the
"Cash/Stock Consideration"). The Cash Consideration and the Stock
Consideration are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the "Merger
Consideration."



3.1.4. Each outstanding share of FSBI Common Stock the holder of which has
perfected his right to dissent under the DGCL and has not effectively
withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive
the Merger Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be entitled
only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL. FSBI shall give PFS prompt
notice upon receipt by FSBI of any such demands for payment of the fair value
of such shares of FSBI Common Stock and of withdrawals of such notice and any
other instruments provided pursuant to applicable law (any stockholder duly
making such demand being hereinafter called a "Dissenting Stockholder"), and
PFS shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any such demands. FSBI shall not, except with the prior
written consent of PFS, voluntarily  



 

8  make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demand for payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand
for appraisal or the taking of any other action by such Dissenting
Stockholder as may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL.
Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by the
Surviving Company.



3.1.5. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment at or
prior to the Effective Time, such holders shares of FSBI Common Stock shall
be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement. If such holder
shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
his right to such payment after the Effective Time (or the Election Deadline,
as defined below), each share of FSBI Common Stock of such holder shall be
treated as a Non-Election Share.



3.1.6. After the Effective Time, shares of FSBI Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and shall thereafter by operation of this section be the right to receive the
Merger Consideration.



3.1.7. In the event PFS changes (or establishes a record date for changing)
the number of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of PFS Common Stock
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar
transaction with respect to the outstanding PFS Common Stock and the record
date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall
be proportionately and appropriately adjusted;  _provided_ , _that_ no such
adjustment shall be made with regard to PFS Common Stock if PFS issues
additional shares of PFS Common Stock and receives fair market value
consideration for such shares.



__3.2. _Election Procedures._



3.2.1. Holders of FSBI Common Stock may elect to receive shares of PFS Common
Stock or cash (in either case without interest) in exchange for their shares
of FSBI Common Stock in accordance with the following procedures, provided
that, in the aggregate, and subject to the provisions of Section 3.2.6,
60% of the total number of shares of FSBI Common Stock issued and outstanding
at the Effective Time, including any Dissenting Shares but excluding any
Treasury Stock (the "Stock Conversion Number"), shall be converted into the
Stock Consideration and the remaining outstanding shares of FSBI Common Stock
shall be converted into the Cash Consideration. Shares of FSBI Common Stock as
to which a Cash Election (including, pursuant to a Mixed Election) has been
made are referred to herein as "Cash Election Shares." Shares of FSBI Common
Stock as to which a Stock Election has been made (including, pursuant to a
Mixed Election) are referred to as "Stock Election Shares." Shares of FSBI
Common Stock as to which no election has been made (or as to which an
Election Form is not returned properly completed) are referred to herein as
"Non-Election Shares." The aggregate number of shares of FSBI Common Stock
with respect to which a Stock Election has been made is referred to herein as
the "Stock Election Number." Any Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to be Cash
Election Shares, and the holders thereof shall in no event receive
consideration comprised of PFS Common Stock with respect to such shares. __



3.2.2. An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
such Certificates to the Exchange Agent), in such form as FSBI and PFS shall
mutually agree ("Election Form"), shall be mailed 40 days prior to the
anticipated Effective Time or on such earlier date as PFS and FSBI shall
mutually agree (the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record of FSBI Common
Stock as of five business days prior to the Mailing Date (the "Election Form
Record Date"). Each Election Form shall permit such holder, subject to the
allocation and election procedures set forth in this Section 3.2, __(i) to
elect to receive the Cash Consideration for all of the shares of FSBI Common
Stock held by such holder (a "Cash Election"), in accordance with Section
3.1.3, (ii) to elect to receive the Stock Consideration for all of such
shares (a "Stock Election"), in accordance with Section 3.1.3, (iii) elect to
receive the Stock Consideration for a part of such holder s FSBI Common Stock
and the Cash consideration for the remaining part of such holders FSBI
Common Stock (a "Mixed Election"), or (iv) to indicate that such record holder
 



 

9  has no preference as to the receipt of cash or PFS Common Stock for such
shares (a "Non-Election"). A holder of record of shares of FSBI Common Stock
who holds such shares as nominee, trustee or in another representative
capacity (a "Representative") may submit multiple Election Forms, provided
that each such Election Form covers all the shares of FSBI Common Stock held
by such Representative for a particular beneficial owner. Any shares of FSBI
Common Stock with respect to which the holder thereof shall not, as of the
Election Deadline, have made an election by submission to the Exchange Agent
of an effective, properly completed Election Form shall be deemed Non-
Election Shares. All Dissenting Shares shall be deemed shares subject to a
Cash Election, and with respect to such shares the holders thereof shall in no
event receive consideration comprised of PFS Common Stock, subject to Section
3.1.5 hereof. __



3.2.3. To be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be submitted
to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 20th
day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as PFS and FSBI
may mutually agree) (the "Election Deadline"); provided, however, that the
Election Deadline may not occur on or after the Closing Date; and provided
further that the Election Deadline may not occur prior to the seventh business
day after receipt of all Regulatory Approvals (excluding the expiration of any
applicable waiting periods). FSBI shall make available up to two separate
Election Forms, or such additional Election Forms as PFS may permit, to all
persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of FSBI Common Stock between
the Election Form Record Date and the close of business on the business
day prior to the Election Deadline. FSBI shall provide to the Exchange Agent
all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein. An
election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have
actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election
Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if
accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or the
guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing all shares of FSBI
Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed
transmittal materials included with the Election Form. If an FSBI
stockholder either (i) does not submit a properly completed Election Form in
a timely fashion or (ii) revokes its Election Form prior to the Election
Deadline, the shares of FSBI Common Stock held by such stockholder shall be
designated as Non-Election Shares. Any Election Form may be revoked or
changed by the person submitting such Election Form to the Exchange Agent by
written notice to the Exchange Agent only if such notice of revocation or
change is actually received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election
Deadline. PFS shall cause the Certificate or Certificates relating to any
revoked Election Form to be promptly returned without charge to the person
submitting the Election Form to the Exchange Agent. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have
discretion to determine when any election, modification or revocation is
received and whether any such election, modification or revocation has been
properly made.



3.2.4. If the Stock Election Number exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then
all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and, subject to Section 3.2.7
hereof, each holder of Stock Election Shares will be entitled to receive the
Stock Consideration only with respect to that number of Stock Election Shares
held by such holder equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of
which is the Stock Election Number, with the remaining number of such holders
Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration.



3.2.5. If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number
(the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock Election
Number being referred to herein as the "Shortfall Number"), then all Stock
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares
shall be treated in the following manner:



(A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration and, subject to Section 3.2.7 hereof,
each holder of Non-Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in
respect of that number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder equal to the
product obtained by  



 

10  multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the
denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares, with the
remaining number of such holders Non-Election Shares being converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration; or



(B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration, and, subject to Section 3.2.7 hereof, each holder of Cash
Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that
number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such
holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which (1)
the Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election Shares and
the denominator of which is the total number of Cash Election Shares, with the
remaining number of such holders Cash Election Shares being converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration.



3.2.6. Notwithstanding anything in this Article III to the contrary, if the
aggregate value of the Stock Consideration to be delivered as of the Effective
Time less the amount of cash paid in lieu of fractional shares of PFS Common
Stock pursuant to Section 3.2.7 (the "Stock Value") is less than 42.5% of the
sum of (i) the aggregate value of the Merger Consideration to be delivered as
of the Effective Time, plus (ii) the value of any consideration described in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(1)(ii), plus (iii) cash paid to
holders of Dissenting Shares, plus (iv) the value of any consideration paid by
PFS or any of its Subsidiaries (or any "related person" to PFS or any of its
Subsidiaries within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-1(e)(3)) to acquire shares of FSBI Common Stock prior to the Effective
Time (such sum, the "Aggregate Value"), then PFS shall reduce the number of
shares of outstanding FSBI Common Stock entitled to receive the Cash
Consideration and correspondingly increase the number of shares of FSBI Common
Stock entitled to receive the Stock Consideration by the minimum amount
necessary to cause the Stock Value to equal 42.5% of the Aggregate Value. 



3.2.7. _No Fractional Shares. _ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
PFS Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to PFS Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share interest, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of PFS. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, PFS shall pay to each former holder of FSBI Common Stock who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of PFS Common Stock,
an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without interest, equal to
the product of (i) the fraction of a share to which such holder would
otherwise have been entitled and (ii) the average of the daily closing sales
prices of a share of PFS Common Stock as reported on the NYSE for the five
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date. For purposes
of determining any fractional share interest, all shares of FSBI Common Stock
owned by a FSBI stockholder shall be combined so as to calculate the maximum
number of whole shares of PFS Common Stock issuable to such FSBI stockholder.
__



__3.3. _ Procedures for Exchange of FSBI Common Stock._



3.3.1. _PFS to Make Merger Consideration Available._ After the Election
Deadline and no later than the Closing Date, PFS shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of
FSBI Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.3,
certificates representing the shares of PFS Common Stock and an aggregate
amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant
to this Article III (including the estimated amount of cash to be paid in
lieu of fractional shares of FSBI Common Stock) (such cash and certificates
for shares of PFS Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto (without any interest thereon) being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund").



3.3.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. PFS shall take all steps necessary to cause
the Exchange Agent, within five (5) business days after the Effective Time, to
mail to each holder of a Certificate or Certificates who has  



 

11  not previously surrendered such certificates with an Election Form, a form
letter of transmittal for return to the Exchange Agent and instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the FSBI Common
Stock represented by such Certificates shall have been converted as a result
of the Merger if any. The letter of transmittal (which shall be subject to
the reasonable approval of FSBI) shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent. Upon proper surrender of
a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration to which such holder of FSBI common stock shall have become
entitled pursuant to Section 3.1.3 hereof, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
Cash Consideration or any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares or any
unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of
Certificates.



3.3.3. _Rights of Certificate Holders after the Effective Time_. The holder of
a Certificate that prior to the Merger represented issued and outstanding
FSBI Common Stock shall have no rights, after the Effective Time, with respect
to such FSBI Common Stock except to surrender the Certificate in exchange for
the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect to PFS Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the
holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this
Section 3.3. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Section 3.3, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of PFS Common Stock
represented by such Certificate.



3.3.4. _Surrender by Persons Other than Record Holders_. If the Person
surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying letter of transmittal
is not the record holder thereof, then it shall be a condition of the payment
of the Merger Consideration that: (i) such Certificate is properly endorsed to
such Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case
signed exactly as the name of the record holder appears on such Certificate,
and is otherwise in proper form for transfer, or is accompanied by
appropriate evidence of the authority of the Person surrendering such
Certificate and signing the letter of transmittal to do so on behalf of the
record holder; and (ii) the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.



3.3.5. _Closing of Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of FSBI of the FSBI Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be exchanged for the
Merger Consideration and canceled as provided in this Section 3.3.



3.3.6. _Return of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the six (6) month
period after the Effective Time, PFS shall be entitled to require the Exchange
Agent to deliver to it any portions of the Exchange Fund which had been made
available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates
(including, without limitation, all interest and other income received by the
Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look to PFS (subject to abandoned property,
escheat and other similar laws) with respect to any Merger Consideration that
may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by
them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither PFS nor the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any Merger Consideration
delivered in respect of such Certificate to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.



3.3.7. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by PFS, the posting by such person of a bond in
such amount as PFS  



 

12  may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof.



3.3.8. _Withholding._ PFS or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of FSBI Common Stock
such amounts as PFS (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Exchange Agent are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state,
local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly
withheld by PFS or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
FSBI Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made
by PFS or the Exchange Agent.



 

 __3.4. _Treatment of FSBI Options._



FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 3.4 sets forth all of the outstanding FSBI Options as
of the date hereof. At the Effective Time, each FSBI Option which
is unexercised and outstanding immediately prior thereto shall, by reason of
the Merger, be terminated and converted into the right to receive in cash an
amount (subject to required tax withholdings) equal to (i) the difference
between (A) the Cash Consideration per share and (B) the exercise price of
each such FSBI Option _multiplied by_ (ii) the number of shares of FSBI Common
Stock subject to the FSBI Option. FSBI agrees to take or to cause to be taken
all actions necessary to provide for such payment at or prior to the
Effective Time, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
written acknowledgement of each holder of a then outstanding FSBI Option with
regard to the termination of such FSBI Option and the full payment therefor
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.



__3.5. _Bank Merger._



FSBI and PFS shall use their best efforts to cause First Savings Bank to
merge with and into The Provident Bank, with The Provident Bank as the
surviving institution, concurrently with, or as soon as practicable after, the
Effective Time. Following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, PFS
will cause The Provident Bank, and FSBI will cause First Savings Bank, to
execute and deliver a Plan of Bank Merger substantially in the form attached
to this Agreement as Exhibit A.



__3.6. _Reservation of Shares._



PFS shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of the
PFS Common Stock for the purpose of issuing shares of PFS Common Stock to the
FSBI stockholders in accordance with this Article III.



ARTICLE IV



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF FSBI



FSBI represents and warrants to PFS that the statements contained in this
Article IV are correct as of the date of this Agreement and will be correct
as of the Closing Date (as though made then and as though the Closing Date
were substituted for the date of this Agreement throughout this Article IV),
except as set forth in the FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE delivered by FSBI to PFS
on the date hereof, and except as to any representation or warranty which
specifically relates to an earlier date. FSBI has made a good faith effort to
ensure that the disclosure on each schedule of the FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
corresponds to the section referenced herein. However, for purposes of the
FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE, any item disclosed on any schedule therein is deemed
to be fully disclosed with respect to all schedules under which such item may
be relevant as and to the extent that it is reasonably clear on the face of
such schedule that such item applies to such other schedule. References to the
Knowledge of FSBI shall include the Knowledge of First Savings Bank.



 

13 __4.1. _Standard._



No representation or warranty of FSBI contained in this Article IV shall be
deemed untrue or incorrect, and FSBI shall not be deemed to have breached a
representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence of any fact,
circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or
taken together with all other facts, circumstances or events inconsistent
with any paragraph of Article IV, has had or is reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that the foregoing standard shall
not apply to representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.2
(other than the last sentence of Section 4.2.1 and the last sentence of

or otherwise, in respect of which FSBI or any FSBI Subsidiary is an obligor

that restricts or limits in any material way the conduct of business by FSBI
or any FSBI Subsidiary (it being understood that any non-compete or similar
provision shall be deemed material).



4.9.2. Each real estate lease that will require the consent of the lessor or
its agent as a result of the Merger or the Bank Merger by virtue of the terms
of any such lease, is listed in FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.9.2 identifying
the section of the lease that contains such prohibition or restriction.
Subject to any consents that may be required as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to its Knowledge, neither FSBI nor any FSBI
Subsidiary is in default in any material respect under any material contract,
agreement, commitment, arrangement, lease, insurance policy or other
instrument to which it is a party, by which its assets, business, or
operations may be bound or affected, or under which it or its assets,
business, or operations receive benefits, and there has not occurred any event
that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute
such a default.



4.9.3. True and correct copies of agreements, contracts, arrangements and
instruments referred to in Section 4.9.1 and 4.9.2 have been made available to
PFS on or before the date hereof, are listed on FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.9.1

FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.9.3, no plan, contract, employment agreement,
termination agreement, or similar agreement or arrangement to which FSBI or
any FSBI Subsidiary is a party or under which FSBI or any FSBI Subsidiary may
be liable contains provisions which permit an employee or independent
contractor to terminate it without cause and continue to accrue future
benefits thereunder. Except as set forth  



 

17  in FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.9.3, no such agreement, plan, contract, or
arrangement (x) provides for acceleration in the vesting of benefits or
payments due thereunder upon the occurrence of a change in ownership or
control of FSBI or any FSBI Subsidiary or upon the occurrence of a subsequent
event; or (y) requires FSBI or any FSBI Subsidiary to provide a benefit in the
form of FSBI Common Stock or determined by reference to the value of FSBI
Common Stock.



__4.10. _Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage._



4.10.1. Except as set forth in FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.10, FSBI and each
FSBI Subsidiary has good and, as to real property, marketable title to all
material assets and properties owned by FSBI or each FSBI Subsidiary in the
conduct of its businesses, whether such assets and properties are real or
personal, tangible or intangible, including assets and property reflected in
the balance sheet contained in the most recent FSBI Financial Statements
or acquired subsequent thereto (except to the extent that such assets and
properties have been disposed of in the ordinary course of business, since the
date of such balance sheet), subject to no material encumbrances, liens,
mortgages, security interests or pledges, except (i) those items which secure
liabilities for public or statutory obligations or any discount with,
borrowing from or other obligations to FHLB, inter-bank credit facilities,
reverse repurchase agreements or any transaction by an FSBI Subsidiary acting
in a fiduciary capacity, and (ii) statutory liens for amounts not yet
delinquent or which are being contested in good faith. FSBI and the FSBI
Subsidiaries, as lessee, have the right under valid and existing leases of
real and personal properties used by FSBI and the FSBI Subsidiaries in the
conduct of their businesses to occupy or use all such properties as presently
occupied and used by each of them. Such existing leases and commitments to
lease constitute or will constitute operating leases for both tax and
financial accounting purposes and the lease expense and minimum rental
commitments with respect to such leases and lease commitments are as disclosed
in all material respects in the notes to the FSBI Financial Statements.



4.10.2. With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which FSBI or any
FSBI Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement to resell, if
any, FSBI or such FSBI Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a lien or
security interest (which to FSBIs Knowledge is a valid, perfected first
lien) in the securities or other collateral securing the repurchase agreement,
and the value of such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt
secured thereby. 



4.10.3. FSBI and each Significant Subsidiary of FSBI currently maintain
insurance considered by each of them to be reasonable for their respective
operations. Neither FSBI nor any Significant Subsidiary of FSBI has received
notice from any insurance carrier that (i) such insurance will be canceled or
that coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs
with respect to such policies of insurance will be substantially increased.
There are presently no material claims pending under such policies of
insurance and no notices have been given by FSBI or any Significant
Subsidiary of FSBI under such policies. All such insurance is valid and
enforceable and in full force and effect, and within the last three years FSBI
and each Significant Subsidiary of FSBI has received each type of insurance
coverage for which it has applied and during such periods has not been denied
indemnification for any material claims submitted under any of its insurance
policies. FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.10.3 identifies all policies of
insurance maintained by FSBI and each Significant Subsidiary of FSBI as well
as the other matters required to be disclosed under this Section.



__4.11. _Legal Proceedings._

proceedings, claims (whether asserted or unasserted), actions or governmental
investigations or inquiries of any nature, (i) against FSBI or any FSBI
Subsidiary, (ii) to which FSBI or any FSBI Subsidiarys assets are or may be
subject, (iii) challenging the validity or propriety of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) which could adversely
affect the ability of FSBI to perform under this Agreement, except for  



 

18  any proceeding, claim, action, investigation or inquiry referred to in
clauses (i) and (ii) which, if adversely determined, individually or in the
aggregate, could not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. __



__4.12. _Compliance With Applicable Law._



4.12.1. To FSBIs Knowledge, each of FSBI and each FSBI Subsidiary is in

Knowledge of FSBI, no suspension or cancellation of any such permit, license,
certificate, order or approval is threatened or will result from the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to
obtaining the approvals set forth in Section 8.3.



4.12.3. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, neither FSBI nor any FSBI

other communication from any Bank Regulator (i) asserting that FSBI or any
FSBI Subsidiary is not in material compliance with any of the statutes,
regulations or ordinances which such Bank Regulator enforces;
(ii) threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental
authorization which is material to FSBI or any FSBI Subsidiary; (iii)

bank deposits restricting or limiting, or purporting to restrict or limit, in
any material respect the operations of FSBI or any FSBI Subsidiary, including
without limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends; or (iv)
directing, restricting or limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or
limit, in any material manner the operations of FSBI or any FSBI Subsidiary
(any such notice, communication, memorandum, agreement or order described in
this sentence is hereinafter referred to as a "Regulatory Agreement").
Neither FSBI nor any FSBI Subsidiary has consented to or entered into any
Regulatory Agreement that is currently in effect. The most recent regulatory

19  agreements and all other material benefit practices, policies and

or former employee, consultant or former consultant or director or former
director of FSBI or any FSBI Subsidiary participates or to which any such
employee, consultant or director is a party or is otherwise entitled to
receive benefits (the "Compensation and Benefit Plans"). Except as set forth
in FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.1, neither FSBI nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any commitment to create any additional Compensation and Benefit Plan or
to materially modify, change or renew any existing Compensation and Benefit
Plan (any modification or change that increases the cost of such plans would
be deemed material), except as required to maintain the qualified status
thereof, FSBI has made available to PFS true and correct copies of the
Compensation and Benefit Plans. There are no outstanding unvested or
unexercised awards under the First Savings Bank 1992 Incentive Stock Option
Plan and the First Savings Bank 1992 Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors
and there are no awards available for issuance under either such plan.



4.13.2. Except as disclosed in FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.2, each
Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and with applicable
law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA, the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and any regulations or rules
promulgated thereunder, and all material filings, disclosures and notices
required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act and any other applicable law have been timely
made or any interest, fines, penalties or other impositions for late filings
have been paid in full. Each Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an
"employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a
"Pension Plan") _and_ which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS, and
FSBI is not aware of any circumstances which are reasonably likely to result
in revocation of any such favorable determination letter. There is no
material pending or, to the Knowledge of FSBI, threatened action, suit or
claim relating to any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than
routine claims for benefits). Neither FSBI nor any FSBI Subsidiary has engaged
in a transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect to any
Compensation and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject
FSBI or any FSBI Subsidiary to an unpaid tax or penalty imposed by either
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA. 



4.13.3. Except as set forth in FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.3, no liability,
other than PBGC premiums arising in the ordinary course of business, has been
or is expected by FSBI or any of its Subsidiaries to be incurred with respect
to any FSBI Compensation and Benefit Plan which is a defined benefit plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA ("FSBI Defined Benefit Plan"), or with respect to
any "single-employer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a) of ERISA) currently
or formerly maintained by FSBI or any entity which is considered one employer
with FSBI under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an
"ERISA Affiliate") (such plan hereinafter referred to as an "ERISA Affiliate
Plan"). To the Knowledge of FSBI and any FSBI Subsidiary, except as set forth
in FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.3, no FSBI Defined Benefit Plan had an
"accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA), whether
or not waived, as of the last day of the end of the most recent plan year
ending prior to the date hereof. Except as set forth in FSBI DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 4.13.3, the fair market value of the assets of each FSBI Defined
Benefit Plan exceeds the present value of the benefits guaranteed under
Section 4022 of ERISA under such FSBI Defined Benefit Plan as of the end of
the most recent plan year with respect to the respective FSBI Defined Benefit
Plan ending prior to the date hereof, calculated on the basis of the actuarial
assumptions used in the most recent actuarial valuation for such FSBI Defined
Benefit Plan as of the date hereof; and no notice of a "reportable event" (as
defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the 30-day reporting requirement
has not been waived has been required to be filed for any FSBI Defined
Benefit Plan within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof. Except as
set forth in FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.3, neither FSBI nor any of its
Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any FSBI
Defined Benefit Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate
pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code or has taken any action, or omitted
to take any action, that has resulted, or would reasonably be expected
to result in the imposition of a lien under Section 412(n) of the  



 

20  Code or pursuant to ERISA. To the Knowledge of FSBI, and except as set forth
in FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.3, there is no pending investigation
or enforcement action by any Bank Regulator with respect to any Compensation
and Benefit Plan or any ERISA Affiliate Plan. All retirement benefits for John
Mulkerin under the First Savings Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan II was
expensed and accrued in the year of Mr. Mulkerins retirement from the FSBI
Board of Directors.



4.13.4. Except as set forth in FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.4, with respect
to any FSBI Defined Benefit Plan that is a "multi-employer plan" as such term
is defined in section 3(37) of ERISA, covering employees of FSBI or any ERISA
Affiliate, (i) neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has made or
suffered a "complete withdrawal" or "partial withdrawal," as such terms are

thereunder.



4.13.11. To the Knowledge of FSBI, the consummation of the Merger and/or the

transactions contemplated hereby from Section 203 of the DGCL. The affirmative
vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of FSBI Common Stock

of incorporation (and no greater voting requirement is applicable by reason of
Article EIGHTH of the Certificate of Incorporation) and the DGCL. The
FSBI Rights Agreement will not apply to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Pursuant to Section 29 of the FSBI Rights Agreement, the
Board of Directors of FSBI has determined that PFS is not an "Acquiring
Person" and will not be an "Acquiring Person" upon consummation of the
Merger.



__4.21. _Registration Obligations._



Neither FSBI nor any FSBI Subsidiary is under any obligation, contingent or
otherwise, which will survive the Effective Time by reason of any agreement to
register any transaction involving any of its securities under the Securities
Act. 



__4.22. _Risk Management Instruments._

entered into for FSBIs own account, or for the account of one or more of
FSBIs Subsidiaries or their customers (all of which are set forth in
FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.22), were in all material respects entered into in
compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory
policies, and to the Knowledge of FSBI and each FSBI Subsidiary, with
counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time; and to
FSBIs and each FSBI Subsidiarys Knowledge each of them constitutes the valid
and legally binding obligation of FSBI or such FSBI Subsidiary, enforceable in
accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights or by general equity principles), and is in full force and
effect. Neither FSBI nor any FSBI Subsidiary, nor, to the Knowledge of FSBI,
any other party thereto, is in breach of any of its obligations under any such
agreement or arrangement in any material respect.



__4.23. _Fairness Opinion._



FSBI has received an opinion from Sandler ONeill to the effect that, subject
to the terms, conditions and qualifications set forth therein, as of the date
hereof, the Merger Consideration to be received by the stockholders of FSBI
pursuant to this Agreement is fair to such stockholders from a financial point
of view. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the date of
this Agreement.



__4.24. _Intellectual Property._



FSBI and each Significant Subsidiary of FSBI owns or, to FSBIs Knowledge,
possesses valid and binding licenses and other rights to use all patents,
copyrights, trade secrets, trade names, servicemarks and trademarks  



 

25  used in their business, each without payment, and neither FSBI nor any
Significant Subsidiary of FSBI has received any notice of conflict with
respect thereto that asserts the rights of others. FSBI and each Significant
Subsidiary of FSBI have performed all the obligations required to be
performed, and are not in default in any respect, under any contract,
agreement, arrangement or commitment relating to any of the foregoing.

Subsidiaries have not executed an extension or waiver of any statute of
limitations on the assessment or collection of any material tax due that is
currently in effect. PFS

their businesses to occupy or use all such properties as presently occupied

enforceable and in full force and effect, and within the last three years PFS
and each Significant Subsidiary of PFS has received each type of insurance

__5.12. _Employee Benefit Plans._



5.12.1. PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 5.12.1 includes a list of all existing bonus,
incentive, deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit-sharing,
thrift, savings, employee stock ownership, stock bonus, stock purchase,
restricted stock, stock option, stock appreciation, phantom stock, severance,
welfare benefit plans, fringe benefit plans, employment, severance and change
in control agreements and all other benefit practices, policies and
arrangements maintained by PFS or any PFS Subsidiary and in which employees in
general may participate (the "PFS Compensation and Benefit Plans"). Each PFS
Compensation and Benefit Plan has been administered in form and in operation,
in all material respects with its terms and all applicable requirements of law
and no notice has been issued by any Governmental Authority questioning or
challenging such compliance. With respect to each of the PFS Compensation and
Benefit Plans, if applicable, PFS has provided or made available to FSBI
copies of the most recent summary plan description (or other such summary of
the terms of the plan).



 

30 5.12.2. To the Knowledge of PFS and except as disclosed in PFS DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 5.12.2, each PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and with
applicable law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA, the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and any regulations or
rules promulgated thereunder, and all material filings, disclosures and
notices required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and any other applicable law have
been timely made or any interest, fines, penalties or other impositions for
late filings have been paid in full. Each PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan
which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2)
of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") _and_ which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received or has requested and expects to
receive a favorable determination letter from the IRS, and PFS is not aware of
any circumstances which are reasonably likely to result in revocation of any
such favorable determination letter. There is no material pending or, to
the Knowledge of PFS, threatened action, suit or claim relating to any of the
PFS Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for benefits).
Neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction, or omitted to
take any action, with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan that would
reasonably be expected to subject PFS or any PFS Subsidiary to an unpaid tax
or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.



5.12.3. No liability, other than PBGC premiums arising in the ordinary course
of business, has been or is expected by PFS or any of its Subsidiaries to be
incurred with respect to any PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan which is a
defined benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA ("PFS Defined
Benefit Plan"), or with respect to any "single-employer plan" (as defined in
Section 4001(a) of ERISA) currently or formerly maintained by PFS or any
entity which is considered one employer with PFS under Section 4001(b)(1) of
ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate") (such plan
hereinafter referred to as an "ERISA Affiliate Plan"). No PFS Defined Benefit
Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan," as such term is defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA. To the Knowledge of PFS, except as set forth in PFS
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 5.12.3, no PFS Defined Benefit Plan had an "accumulated
funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not
waived, as of the last day of the end of the most recent plan year ending
prior to the date hereof. Except as set forth in PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
5.12.3, the fair market value of the assets of each PFS Defined Benefit Plan
exceeds the present value of the benefits guaranteed under Section 4022 of
ERISA under such PFS Defined Benefit Plan as of the end of the most recent
plan year with respect to the respective PFS Defined Benefit Plan ending prior
to the date hereof, calculated on the basis of the actuarial assumptions used
in the most recent actuarial valuation for such PFS Defined Benefit Plan as of
the date hereof; and no notice of a "reportable event" (as defined in Section
4043 of ERISA) for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been
waived has been required to be filed for any PFS Defined Benefit Plan within
the 12-month period ending on the date hereof. Neither PFS nor any of its
Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any PFS
Defined Benefit Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate
pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code or has taken any action, or omitted
to take any action, that has resulted, or would reasonably be expected to
result in the imposition of a lien under Section 412(n) of the Code or
pursuant to ERISA. Neither PFS, its Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA Affiliate has
contributed to any "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA,
on or after January 1, 1998. To the Knowledge of PFS, there is no pending
investigation or enforcement action by any Bank Regulator with respect to any
PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan or any ERISA Affiliate Plan.



5.12.4. All material contributions required to be made under the terms of any
PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan or any employee
benefit arrangements to which PFS or any PFS Subsidiary is a party or a
sponsor have been timely made, and all anticipated contributions and funding
obligations are accrued on PFSs consolidated financial statements to the
extent required by GAAP. PFS and its Subsidiaries have expensed and accrued
as a liability the present value of future benefits under each applicable PFS
Compensation and Benefit Plan for financial reporting purposes as required by
GAAP.



 

31 5.12.5. Except as set forth in PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 5.12.5, neither PFS nor
any PFS Subsidiary has any obligations to provide retiree health, life
insurance, disability insurance, or other retiree death benefits under any
Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than benefits mandated by Section 4980B
of the Code.



__5.13. _Environmental Matters._



5.13.1. To the Knowledge of PFS, neither the conduct nor operation of their
business nor any condition of any property currently or previously owned or
operated by any of them (including, without limitation, in a fiduciary or
agency capacity), or on which any of them holds a lien, results or resulted in
a violation of any Environmental Laws that is reasonably likely to impose a
material liability (including a material remediation obligation) upon PFS or
any of PFS Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of PFS, no condition has existed or
event has occurred with respect to any of them or any such property that,
with notice or the passage of time, or both, is reasonably likely to result in
any material liability to PFS or any PFS Subsidiary by reason of any
Environmental Laws. Neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary has received any
written notice from any Person that PFS or any PFS Subsidiary or the operation
or condition of any property ever owned, operated, or held as collateral or in
a fiduciary capacity by any of them are currently in violation of or
otherwise are alleged to have financial exposure under any Environmental Laws
or relating to Materials of Environmental Concern (including, but not limited
to, responsibility (or potential responsibility) for the cleanup or other
remediation of any Materials of Environmental Concern at, on, beneath, or
originating from any such property) for which a material liability is
reasonably likely to be imposed upon PFS or any PFS Subsidiary.



5.13.2. There is no suit, claim, action, demand, executive or administrative
order, directive, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the PFSs
Knowledge, threatened, before any court, governmental agency or other forum
against PFS or any PFS Subsidiary (x) for alleged noncompliance (including
by any predecessor) with, or liability under, any Environmental Law or (y)
relating to the presence of or release into the environment of any Materials
of Environmental Concern (as defined herein), whether or not occurring at or
on a site owned, leased or operated by any of the PFS.



__5.14. _Loan Portfolio. _



5.14.1. The allowance for loan losses reflected in PFSs audited consolidated
statement of condition at December 31, 2002 was, and the allowance for loan
losses shown on the balance sheets in PFSs Securities Documents for periods
ending after December 31, 2002 were or will be, adequate, as of the dates
thereof, under GAAP.



5.14.2. PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 5.14.2 sets forth a listing, as of the most
recently available date, all loans of PFS and any PFS Subsidiary (1) that are
contractually past due 90 days or more in the payment of principal and/or
interest, (2) that are on non-accrual status, (3) that as of the date of this
Agreement are classified as "Other Loans Specially Mentioned", "Special
Mention", "Substandard", "Doubtful", "Loss", "Classified", "Criticized",
"Watch list" or words of similar import, together with the principal amount of
and accrued and unpaid interest on each such Loan and the identity of the
obligor thereunder, (4) where a reasonable doubt exists as to the timely
future collectability of principal and/or interest, whether or not interest is
still accruing or the loans are less than 90 days past due, (5) where the
interest rate terms have been reduced and/or the maturity dates have been
extended subsequent to the agreement under which the loan was originally
created due to concerns regarding the borrowers ability to pay in accordance
with such initial terms, or (6) where a specific reserve allocation exists in
connection therewith; and all assets classified by PFS or any PFS Subsidiary
as real estate acquired through foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure,
including in-substance foreclosures, and all other assets currently held that
were acquired through foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure. DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 5.14.2 may exclude any individual loan with a principal outstanding
balance of less than $100,000.



 

32 5.14.3. All loans receivable (including discounts) and accrued interest
entered on the books of PFS and each PFS Subsidiary arose out of bona fide
arms-length transactions, were made for good and valuable consideration in
the ordinary course of business, and the notes or other evidences of
indebtedness with respect to such loans (including discounts) are true and
genuine and are what they purport to be.



5.14.4. The notes and other evidences of indebtedness evidencing the loans
described above, and all pledges, mortgages, deeds of trust and other
collateral documents or security instruments relating thereto are, in all
material respects, valid, true and genuine, and what they purport to be.

the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2003 and (iii) proxy

__5.16. _Deposits._



None of the deposits of any PFS Subsidiary is a "brokered deposit" as defined
in 12 C.F.R. Section 337.6(a)(2).



__5.17. _ Antitakeover Provisions Inapplicable; Required Vote._



The transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not subject to the
requirements of any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "affiliate
transactions," "business combination" or other antitakeover laws and

applicable to PFS or any PFS Subsidiary. The affirmative vote of a majority of
the issued and outstanding shares of PFS Common Stock is required to approve

futures and forward contracts and other similar risk management arrangements,
whether entered into for PFSs own account, or for the account of one or more
of PFSs Subsidiaries or their customers, were in all material respects
entered into in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and
regulatory policies, and to the Knowledge of PFS and each PFS Subsidiary, with
counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time; and each of
them constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of PFS or one of
its Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity
principles), and is in full force and effect. Neither PFS nor any PFS
Subsidiary, nor to the Knowledge of PFS any other party thereto, is in breach
of any of its obligations under any such agreement or arrangement in any
material respect.

arbitration or proceedings; or



(X) agree to do any of the foregoing.



__6.2. _Current Information._

 



6.2.1. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, FSBI will cause one or more of its representatives to confer with
representatives of PFS and report the general status of its ongoing operations
at such times as PFS may reasonably request. FSBI will promptly notify PFS of
any material change in the normal course of its business or in the operation
of its properties and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, of any
governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the
threat of material litigation involving FSBI or any FSBI Subsidiary.



6.2.2. First Savings Bank and The Provident Bank shall meet on a regular basis
to discuss and plan for the conversion of First Savings Banks data
processing and related electronic informational systems to those used by The
Provident Bank, which planning shall include, but not be limited to,
discussion of the possible termination by First Savings Bank of third-party
service provider arrangements effective at the Effective Time or at a date
thereafter, non-renewal of personal property leases and software licenses used
by First Savings Bank in connection with its systems operations, retention of
outside consultants and additional employees to assist with the conversion,
and outsourcing, as appropriate, of proprietary or self-provided system
services, it being understood that First Savings Bank shall not be obligated
to take any such action prior to the Effective Time and, unless First Savings
Bank otherwise agrees, no conversion shall take place prior to the Effective
Time. In the event that First Savings Bank takes, at the request of The
Provident Bank, any action relative to third parties to facilitate the
conversion that results in the imposition of any termination fees or charges,
The Provident Bank shall indemnify First Savings Bank for any such fees and
charges, and the costs of reversing the conversion process, if for any reason
the Merger is not consummated for any reason other than a breach of this
Agreement by FSBI, or a termination of this Agreement under Section 11.1.8 or
11.1.9.



6.2.3. FSBI shall provide PFS, within fifteen (15) business days of the end of
each calendar month, a written list of nonperforming assets (the term
"nonperforming assets," for purposes of this subsection,  



 

37  means (i) loans that are "troubled debt restructuring" as defined in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15, "Accounting by Debtors
and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructuring," (ii) loans on nonaccrual,
(iii) real estate owned, (iv) all loans ninety (90) days or more past due) as
of the end of such month and (iv) and impaired loans. On a monthly basis, FSBI
shall provide PFS with a schedule of all loan approvals, which schedule shall
indicate the loan amount, loan type and other material features of the loan.



6.2.4. FSBI shall promptly inform PFS upon receiving notice of any legal,
administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, demands, notices, audits or
investigations (by any federal, state or local commission, agency or board)
relating to the alleged liability of FSBI or any FSBI Subsidiary under any
labor or employment law.



__6.3. _Access to Properties and Records._



Subject to Section 12.1 hereof, FSBI shall permit PFS reasonable access
upon reasonable notice to its properties and those of the FSBI Subsidiaries,
and shall disclose and make available to PFS during normal business hours all
of its books, papers and records relating to the assets, properties,
operations, obligations and liabilities, including, but not limited to, all
books of account (including the general ledger), tax records, minute books of
directors (other than minutes that discuss any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other subject matter FSBI reasonably
determines should be treated as confidential) and stockholders meetings,
organizational documents, Bylaws, material contracts and agreements, filings
with any regulatory authority, litigation files, plans affecting employees,
and any other business activities or prospects in which PFS may have a
reasonable interest; provided, however, that FSBI shall not be required to
take any action that would provide access to or to disclose information where
such access or disclosure, in FSBIs reasonable judgment, would interfere
with the normal conduct of FSBIs business or would violate or prejudice the
rights or business interests or confidences of any customer or other person or
would result in the waiver by it of the privilege protecting communications
between it and any of its counsel. FSBI shall provide and shall request its
auditors to provide PFS with such historical financial information regarding
it (and related audit reports and consents) as PFS may reasonably request for
securities disclosure purposes. PFS shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize any interference with FSBIs regular business operations during
any such access to FSBIs property, books and records. FSBI and each FSBI
Subsidiary shall permit PFS, at its expense, to cause a "phase I environmental
audit" and a "phase II environmental audit" to be performed at any physical
location owned or occupied by FSBI or any FSBI Subsidiary.



__6.4. _Financial and Other Statements._



6.4.1. Promptly upon receipt thereof, FSBI will furnish to PFS copies of each
annual, interim or special audit of the books of FSBI and the FSBI
Subsidiaries made by its independent accountants and copies of all internal
control reports submitted to FSBI by such accountants in connection with each
annual, interim or special audit of the books of FSBI and the FSBI
Subsidiaries made by such accountants.



6.4.2. As soon as reasonably available, but in no event later than five
business days after such documents are filed with the SEC, FSBI will deliver
to PFS the Securities Documents filed by it with the SEC under the Securities
Laws. Within 25 days after the end of each month, FSBI will deliver to PFS a
consolidated balance sheet and a consolidated statement of operations,
without related notes, for such month prepared in accordance with current
financial reporting practices.



6.4.3. FSBI will advise PFS promptly of the receipt of any examination report
of any Bank Regulator with respect to the condition or activities of FSBI or
any of the FSBI Subsidiaries.



6.4.4. With reasonable promptness, FSBI will furnish to PFS such additional
financial data that FSBI possesses and as PFS may reasonably request,
including without limitation, detailed monthly financial statements and loan
reports. 



 

38 __6.5. _Maintenance of Insurance._



FSBI shall maintain, and cause the FSBI Subsidiaries to maintain,
insurance in such amounts as are reasonable to cover such risks as are
customary in relation to the character and location of its properties and the
nature of its business



__6.6. _Disclosure Supplements._



From time to time prior to the Effective Time, FSBI will promptly supplement
or amend the FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE delivered in connection herewith with
respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known
at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE or which is necessary to correct
any information in such FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE which has been rendered
materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such FSBI
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE shall have any effect for the purpose of determining
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX.



__6.7. _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties._



FSBI and First Savings Bank shall use all commercially reasonable efforts,
and shall cause each FSBI Subsidiary to obtain as soon as practicable all
consents and approvals of any other persons necessary or desirable for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, FSBI shall utilize the services of a
professional proxy soliciting firm to provide assistance in obtaining the
stockholder vote required to be obtained by it hereunder.



__6.8. _All Reasonable Efforts._



Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, FSBI agrees to use,
and agrees to cause First Savings Bank to use, all commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of FSBI
will amend the FSBI Rights Agreement to provide for its termination effective
upon the Effective Time.



__6.9. _Failure to Fulfill Conditions._



In the event that FSBI or First Savings Bank determines that a condition
to its obligation to complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will
not waive that condition, it will promptly notify PFS.



__6.10. _No Solicitation._



From and after the date hereof until the termination of this Agreement,
neither FSBI, nor any FSBI Subsidiary, nor any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents and affiliates
(including, without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by FSBI or any of the FSBI Subsidiaries), will, directly or
indirectly, initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing non-public information or assistance) any inquiries or the making
of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), or enter into or maintain or
continue discussions or negotiate with any Person in furtherance of such
inquiries or to obtain an Acquisition Proposal or agree to or endorse any
Acquisition Proposal, or authorize or permit any of its officers, directors,
or employees or any of its Subsidiaries or any investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by any of its
Subsidiaries to take any such action, and FSBI shall notify PFS orally (within
one business day) and in writing (as promptly as practicable) of all of the
relevant details relating to all inquiries and proposals which it or any of
its Subsidiaries or any such officer, director or employee, or, to FSBIs
Knowledge, investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or
other representative of FSBI may receive relating to any of such matters,
_provided, however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 6.10 shall
prohibit the Board of Directors of FSBI from (i) complying with its
disclosure obligations under federal or state  



 

39  law; or (ii) furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, any person or entity that makes an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal, if, and only to the extent that, (A) the Board of
Directors of FSBI determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors), taking into account all legal, financial and
regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, that
such proposal, if consummated, is reasonably likely to result in a transaction
more favorable to FSBIs stockholders from a financial point of view than the
Merger; (B) the Board of Directors of FSBI determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors) that the failure to
furnish information to or enter into discussions with such Person would likely
cause the Board of Directors to breach its fiduciary duties to stockholders
under applicable law (such proposal that satisfies clauses (A) and (B) being
referred to herein as a "Superior Proposal"); (C) FSBI promptly notifies PFS
of such inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such
information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to
be initiated or continued with FSBI or any of its representatives indicating,
in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers, and receives from such
Person an executed confidentiality agreement in form and substance identical
in all material respects to the confidentiality agreements that FSBI and PFS
entered into; and (D) the FSBI Stockholders Meeting has not occurred. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any proposal or
offer as to any of the following (other than the transactions contemplated
hereunder) involving FSBI or any of its Subsidiaries: (i) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, or other similar
transactions; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or
other disposition of 25% or more of the assets of FSBI and the
FSBI Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or series of
transactions; (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of FSBI or the filing of a registration
statement under the Securities Act in connection therewith; or (iv) any
public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the
foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.



__6.11. _Reserves and Merger-Related Costs._



On or before the Effective Time, and to the extent consistent with GAAP, the
rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable banking laws and regulations,
FSBI shall establish such additional accruals and reserves as may be necessary
to conform the accounting reserve practices and methods (including credit loss
practices and methods) of FSBI to those of PFS (as such practices and methods
are to be applied to FSBI from and after the Closing Date) and PFSs plans
with respect to the conduct of the business of FSBI following the Merger and
otherwise to reflect Merger-related expenses and costs incurred by FSBI,
provided, however, that FSBI shall not be required to take such action unless
PFS agrees in writing that all conditions to closing set forth in Article IX
have been satisfied or waived (except for the expiration of any applicable
waiting periods); prior to the delivery by PFS of the writing referred to in
the preceding clause, FSBI shall provide PFS a written statement, certified
without personal liability by the chief executive officer of FSBI and dated
the date of such writing, that the representation made in Section 4.16.1
hereof is true as of such date or, alternatively, setting forth in detail the
circumstances that prevent such representation from being true as of such
date; and no accrual or reserve made by FSBI or any FSBI Subsidiary pursuant
to this subsection, or any litigation or regulatory proceeding arising out of
any such accrual or reserve, shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach or
violation of any representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other
provision of this Agreement or to constitute a termination event within the
meaning of Section 11.1.2 hereof. No action shall be required to be taken by
FSBI pursuant to this Section 6.11 if, in the opinion of FSBIs independent
auditors, such action would contravene GAAP.



ARTICLE VII 



COVENANTS OF PFS



__7.1. _Conduct of Business._



During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, except with the written consent of FSBI, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, PFS will, and it will cause
each PFS Subsidiary to: conduct its business only in the usual, regular and
ordinary course consistent with past  



 

40  practices; use reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business
organization and assets and maintain its rights and franchises; and
voluntarily take no action that would: (i) adversely affect the ability of
the parties to obtain the Regulatory Approvals or materially increase the
period of time necessary to obtain such approvals; (ii) adversely affect its
ability to perform its covenants and agreements under this Agreement; (iii)
result in the representations and warranties contained in Article V of this
Agreement not being true and correct on the date of this Agreement or at any
future date on or prior to the Closing Date or in any of the conditions set
forth in Article IX hereof not being satisfied; (iv) change or waive any
provision of its Certificate of Incorporation or Charter, except as required
by law; or (v) change any method, practice or principle of accounting, except
as may be required from time to time by GAAP (without regard to any optional
early adoption date) or any Bank Regulator responsible for regulating PFS or
The Provident Bank.



__7.2. _Current Information and Consultation._



During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, PFS
will cause one or more of its representatives to confer with representatives
of FSBI and report the general status of its financial condition, operations
and business and matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, at such times as FSBI may reasonably request. PFS will
promptly notify FSBI, to the extent permitted by applicable law, of any
governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the
threat of material litigation involving PFS and any PFS Subsidiary. PFS will
consult with FSBI in advance with respect to any proposed material change in
the business or operations of PFS and with respect to any material strategic
activities of PFS.



__7.3. _Financial and Other Statements._



As soon as reasonably available, but in no event later than the date
such documents are filed with the SEC, PFS will deliver to FSBI the
Securities Documents filed by it with the SEC under the Securities Laws. PFS
will advise FSBI promptly of the receipt of any examination report of any Bank
Regulator with respect to the condition or activities of PFS or any of the
PFS Subsidiaries.



__7.4. _Disclosure Supplements._



From time to time prior to the Effective Time, PFS will promptly supplement
or amend the PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE delivered in connection herewith with
respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known
at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE or which is necessary to correct any
information in such PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE which has been rendered inaccurate
thereby. No supplement or amendment to such PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE shall
have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Article IX.



__7.5. _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties._



PFS and The Provident Bank shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain as soon as practicable all consents and approvals of any other
Persons necessary or desirable for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



__7.6. _All Reasonable Efforts._



Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, PFS agrees to use and
agrees to cause The Provident Bank to use all commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

41 __7.7. _Failure to Fulfill Conditions._



In the event that PFS or The Provident Bank determines that a condition
to its obligation to complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will
not waive that condition, it will promptly notify FSBI.



__7.8. _Employee Benefits; Advisory Board._



7.8.1 PFS will review all other FSBI Compensation and Benefit Plans to
determine whether to maintain, terminate or continue such plans. In the event
employee compensation and/or benefits as currently provided by FSBI or First
Savings Bank are changed or terminated by PFS, in whole or in part, PFS shall
provide Continuing Employees (as defined below in Section 7.8.8) with
compensation and benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially similar
to the compensation and benefits provided to similarly situated PFS employees
(as of the date any such compensation or benefit is provided). All FSBI
Employees who become participants in an PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan
shall, for purposes of determining eligibility for and for any applicable
vesting periods of such employee benefits only (and not for benefit accrual
purposes) be given credit for meeting eligibility and vesting requirements in
such plans for service as an employee of FSBI or First Savings Bank or any
predecessor thereto prior to the Effective Time, provided, however, that
credit for prior service shall not be given under the PFS ESOP or under the
PFS retiree health plan. This Agreement shall not be construed to limit the
ability of PFS or The Provident Bank to terminate the employment of any
employee or to review employee benefits programs from time to time and to make
such changes as they deem appropriate.



7.8.2 The FSBI Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "FSBI ESOP") shall be
terminated as of, or prior to, the Effective Time (all shares held by the ESOP
shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as
elected by the ESOP participants), all outstanding FSBI ESOP indebtedness
shall be repaid, and the balance of the shares and any other assets remaining
in the Loan Suspense Account (as such term is defined in the FSBI ESOP) shall
be allocated and distributed to FSBI ESOP participants (subject to the
receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS), as provided for in
the FSBI ESOP and unless otherwise required by applicable law. Prior to the
Effective Time, FSBI, and following the Effective Time, PFS shall use
their respective best efforts in good faith to obtain such favorable
determination letter (including, but not limited to, making such changes to
the ESOP and the proposed allocations as may be requested by the IRS as a
condition to its issuance of a favorable determination letter). FSBI and
following the Effective Time, PFS, will adopt such amendments to the FSBI ESOP
as may be reasonably required by the IRS as a condition to granting such
favorable determination letter on termination. Neither FSBI, nor following
the Effective Time, PFS shall make any distribution from the FSBI ESOP except
as may be required by applicable law until receipt of such favorable
determination letter. In the case of a conflict between the terms of this
Section and the terms of the FSBI ESOP, the terms of the FSBI ESOP shall
control, however, in the event of any such conflict, FSBI before the Merger,
and PFS, after the Merger, shall use their best efforts to cause the ESOP to
be amended to conform to the requirements of this Section.



7.8.3 PFS shall assume and honor in accordance with their terms and the
methodology for determining the benefits and payments due thereunder that is
set forth in PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 7.8.3, the employment and change in
control agreements between FSBI or First Savings Bank and any officer or
employee thereof which are listed in FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.13. Each of
the officers and employees referenced in FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.13 who
may be entitled to a payment under an employment agreement or change in
control agreement, together with First Savings Bank, FSBI, The Provident Bank
and PFS, shall sign an acknowledgment in connection with the execution of this
Agreement, which shall be included in PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 7.8.3,
agreeing to the methodology set forth therein. At the time of payment of the
amounts set forth in Sections 5(c) and 5(d) of the employment agreements and
Sections 3 and 3(b) of the change in control agreements, each officer or
employee receiving payment thereunder shall enter into an acknowledgment and
release, satisfactory in form to PFS, acknowledging that no further payments
are due under such sections and releasing FSBI, First Savings Bank, PFS and
The Provident Bank and their respective officers, directors and employees
from any and all claims arising thereunder.



 

42 7.8.4 FSBI shall cause First Savings Bank to terminate the First Savings
Bank Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, restated effective as of January
1, 1997 ("SERP I"), and the First Savings Bank Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan II ("SERP II"), prior to December 31, 2003, and to distribute
prior to December 31, 2003, the present value of the benefits to which the
participants therein are entitled. Contemporaneously with the execution of
this Agreement, Christopher Martin shall enter into an acknowledgment,
satisfactory in form to PFS, agreeing to the methodology for payments of the
amount(s) to which he is entitled under SERP I and SERP II and upon payment of
such amounts, releasing First Savings Bank, FSBI, PFS and The Provident Bank
from any and all claims arising thereunder. Further, Mr. Martins
acknowledgment shall specifically acknowledge that the income recognized under
this Section shall not be included in the calculation of the amounts payable
under paragraph 5(c) or (d) of either employment agreement.



7.8.5 Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Christopher
Martin shall enter into an acknowledgment attached to FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
7.8.3 whereby he agrees to exercise all vested options previously granted to
him on or before December 31, 2003, as set forth on FSBI DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
3.4. Further such acknowledgment and release shall specifically acknowledge
that the income recognized pursuant to the exercises contemplated by this
Section shall not be included in the calculation of the amounts payable under
paragraph 5(c) or (d) of either employment agreement.



7.8.6 FSBI agrees to cause First Savings Bank to terminate the FSB Non-
Employee Director Retirement Plan ("Director Retirement Plan") as of, or prior
to, the Effective Time, and to distribute the present value of the
amounts payable thereunder, which present value is set forth in FSBI
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.13, in a lump sum to participants on or before the
Closing Date. Participants in the Director Retirement Plan who are entitled to
benefits in connection with the termination of the Director Retirement Plan
shall agree to enter into a unanimous written consent to terminate such plan
contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement. PFS and The Provident
Bank shall, as of the Effective Time, assume the First Savings Bank Deferred
Fee Plan ("Deferred Fee Plan"). Prior to the Effective Time, FSBI shall cause
First Savings Bank to amend the Deferred Fee Plan: (i) to prohibit the
deferral of additional fee amounts on or after the Effective Time; (ii) to
require that amounts that are invested in FSBI stock continue to be invested
in stock of FSBI (or stock of its successor,) and be distributed to
participants in the form of stock of the FSBI or its successor; and (iii)
to prohibit the termination of the Deferred Fee Plan without the unanimous
written consent of the participants with unpaid benefits thereunder; provided
however, that no such amendment will be made if it results in variable
accounting for the Deferred Fee Plan..



7.8.7 PFS shall honor in accordance with its terms the First Savings Bank
Employee Severance Plan, provided, however that prior to the Closing Date,
FSBI shall cause First Savings Bank to amend the First Savings Bank Employee
Severance Compensation Plan to require any employee receiving a severance
benefit thereunder to execute an acknowledgement and release of employment-
related claims (excluding claims for employee benefits due and payable after
the date of execution of the release), in a form satisfactory to PFS and The
Provident Bank.



7.8.8 In the event of any termination of any FSBI or First Savings Bank
health plan or consolidation of any such plan with any PFS or The Provident
Bank health plan, PFS shall make available to employees of FSBI or First
Savings Bank who continue employment with PFS or a PFS Subsidiary
("Continuing Employees") and their dependents employer-provided health
coverage on the same basis as it provides such coverage to PFS employees.
Unless a Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates coverage under a FSBI
health plan prior to the time that such Continuing Employee becomes eligible
to participate in the PFS health plan, no coverage of any of the Continuing
Employees or their dependents shall terminate under any of the FSBI health
plans prior to the time such Continuing Employees and their dependents become
eligible to participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to
all employees of PFS and their dependents. In the event of a termination or
consolidation of any FSBI health plan, terminated FSBI employees and
qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continued coverage under group
health plans of PFS in accordance with Code Section 4980B(f), consistent with
the provisions below. In the event of any  



 

43  termination of any FSBI health plan, or consolidation of any FSBI health
plan with any PFS health plan, any coverage limitation under the PFS health
plan due to any pre-existing condition shall be waived by the PFS health plan
to the degree that such condition was covered by the FSBI health plan and such
condition would otherwise have been covered by the PFS health plan in the
absence of such coverage limitation. All FSBI Employees who cease
participating in an FSBI health plan and become participants in a comparable
PFS health plan shall receive credit for any co-payment and deductibles paid
under FSBIs health plan for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible
or out-of-pocket requirements under the PFS health plan, upon substantiation,
in a form satisfactory to PFS that such co-payment and/or deductible has been
satisfied. PFS shall assume the retiree health plan of FSBI and First Savings
and shall have the same rights and obligations thereunder.



7.8.9 Effective as of the Closing Date, PFS shall establish an Advisory Board
(the "Advisory Board"). Each person who serves on the Board of Directors of
FSBI or First Savings Bank (except for the directors who join the PFS Board of
Directors pursuant to Section 2.5 of this Agreement) both on the date of this
Agreement and immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be appointed to
the Advisory Board effective immediately following the Effective Time. The
Advisory Board shall meet quarterly, and each advisory board member shall
receive health insurance coverage and an annual advisory board fee, the
aggregate cost of which shall not exceed $24,000 per year per advisory board
member. The advisory board fee shall be paid quarterly for each meeting
attended. The Advisory Board shall be continued for a period of three (3)
years.



__7.9. _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance. _



7.9.1. PFS shall maintain, or shall cause The Provident Bank to maintain, in
effect for six years following the Effective Time, the current directors and
officers liability insurance policies maintained by FSBI (provided, that PFS
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing
terms and conditions which are not materially less favorable) with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no
event shall PFS be required to expend pursuant to this Section 7.9.1 more
than 150% of the annual cost currently expended by FSBI with respect to such
insurance (the "Maximum Amount"); _provided, further,_ that if the amount of
the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage
exceeds the Maximum Amount, PFS shall maintain the most advantageous policies
of directors and officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal
to the Maximum Amount. In connection with the foregoing, FSBI agrees in order
for PFS to fulfill its agreement to provide directors and officers liability
insurance policies for six years to provide such insurer or substitute insurer
with such representations as such insurer may request with respect to the
reporting of any prior claims.



7.9.2. In addition to Section 7.9.1, for a period of six years after the
Effective Time, PFS shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who
is now, or who has been at any time before the date hereof or who becomes
before the Effective Time, an officer or director of FSBI or an FSBI
Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages,
costs, expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities or judgments or
amounts that are paid in settlement (which settlement shall require the prior
written consent of PFS, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, or administrative
(each a "Claim"), in which an Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be
made, a party or witness in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part
out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of
FSBI or a FSBI Subsidiary if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact
arising, existing or occurring before the Effective Time (including, without
limitation, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby),
regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the
Effective Time (the "Indemnified Liabilities"), to the fullest extent
permitted under Delaware (to the extent not prohibited by federal law), PFSs
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and under FSBIs Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws. PFS shall pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by Delaware (to the  



 

44  extent not prohibited by federal law) upon receipt of an undertaking to
repay such advance payments if the Indemnified Party shall be adjudicated
or determined to be not entitled to indemnification in the manner set forth
below. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
Section 7.9.2 upon learning of any Claim, shall notify PFS (but the failure so
to notify PFS shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under
this Section 7.9.2, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
PFS) and shall deliver to PFS the undertaking referred to in the previous
sentence. In the event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time) (1) PFS shall have the right to assume the defense thereof (in
which event the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such
matter) and upon such assumption PFS shall not be liable to any Indemnified
Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof, except that if PFS elects not to assume such defense, or counsel
for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that
there are or may be (whether or not any have yet actually arisen) issues which
raise conflicts of interest between PFS and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them, and
PFS shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties, (2) except to the extent otherwise required due to
conflicts of interest, PFS shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to
pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties whose reasonable
fees and expenses shall be paid promptly as statements are received unless
there is a conflict of interest that necessitates more than one law firm, (3)
PFS shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), and (4) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification
hereunder with respect to a matter as to which (x) he shall have been
adjudicated in any proceeding not to have acted in good faith and in a manner
he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of FSBI
or any FSBI Subsidiary, or (y) in the event that a proceeding is compromised
or settled so as to impose any liability or obligation upon an Indemnified
Party, if there is a determination that with respect to said matter said
Indemnified Party did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of FSBI or any FSBI
Subsidiary. Such determination shall be made in accordance with the DGCL.



7.9.3. In the event that either PFS or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving bank or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of PFS shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.9.



7.9.4. The obligations of PFS provided under this Section 7.9 are intended to
be enforceable against PFS directly by the Indemnified Parties and shall be
binding on all respective successors and permitted assigns of PFS. PFS shall
pay all reasonable costs, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by
any Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided for in this Section 7.9 to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law. The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be
in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under
applicable law. 



__7.10. _Stock Listing._



PFS agrees to list on the NYSE (or such other national securities exchange on
which the shares of the PFS Common Stock shall be listed as of the Closing
Date), subject to official notice of issuance, the shares of PFS Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger.



__7.11. _Stock and Cash Reserve._



PFS agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the Merger
Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of shares
of PFS Common Stock and to maintain sufficient liquid accounts or borrowing
capacity to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.



 

45 __7.12 _. Section 16(b) Exemption._



PFS and FSBI agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and
retain FSBI Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, both
prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that FSBI Insiders not
be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the
conversion of shares of FSBI Common Stock into shares of PFS in the Merger,
and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of
this Section 7.12. Assuming that FSBI delivers to PFS the FSBI Section 16
Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion prior to the Effective
Time, the Board of Directors of PFS, or a committee of non-employee directors
thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the
Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter and in any event prior to
the Effective Time adopt a resolution providing in substance that the receipt
by the FSBI Insiders (as defined below) of PFS Common Stock in exchange for
shares of FSBI Common Stock, pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby
and to the extent such securities are listed in the FSBI Section 16
Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section
16(b) under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law. "FSBI Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all
material respects regarding the FSBI Insiders, the number of shares of FSBI
Common Stock held by each such FSBI Insider and expected to be exchanged for
PFS Common Stock in the Merger. "FSBI Insiders" shall mean those officers and
directors of FSBI who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are expected to be subject to Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to PFS Common Stock subsequent to the
Effective Time.

PFS in the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such Joint Proxy
Statement-Prospectus that corrects such misstatement or omission, and PFS
shall file an amended Merger Registration Statement with the SEC, and each of

referred to above. FSBI shall have the right to review and approve in advance
all characterizations of the information relating to FSBI and any of its  



 

47  Subsidiaries which appear in any filing made in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any governmental body. In

FSBI:



11.1.1. At any time by the mutual written agreement of PFS and FSBI;



11.1.2. By either party (provided, that the terminating party is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach of any of the
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the

contained herein) if there shall have been a material failure to perform or
comply with any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on

11.1.4. At the election of either party, if the Closing shall not have

to in writing by PFS and FSBI; provided, that no party may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1.4 if the failure of the Closing to
have occurred on or before said date was due to such partys material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement;



11.1.5. By either party, if the stockholders of FSBI or PFS shall have voted
at the FSBI or PFS Stockholders Meeting on the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and such vote shall not have been sufficient to approve such
transactions;



11.1.6. By either party if (i) final action has been taken by a Bank Regulator
whose approval is required in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, which final action (x) has become
unappealable and (y) does not approve this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) any Bank Regulator whose approval or nonobjection is
required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby has stated in writing that it will not issue the required approval or
nonobjection, or (iii) any court of competent jurisdiction or other
governmental authority shall have issued an order, decree, ruling or taken
any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger
and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
unappealable;



11.1.7. By the Board of Directors of either party (provided, that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) in the event that any
of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such party to consummate the

11.1.4 of this Agreement.



11.1.8. By the Board of Directors of PFS if FSBI has received a Superior
Proposal and the Board of Directors of FSBI has entered into an acquisition
agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal, terminated this Agreement,
withdrawn its recommendation of this Agreement, has failed to make such
recommendation or has modified or qualified its recommendation in a manner
adverse to PFS.



11.1.9. By the Board of Directors of FSBI if FSBI has received a Superior
Proposal and the Board of Directors of FSBI has made a determination to accept
such Superior Proposal; _provided that_ FSBI shall not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1.9 and enter in a definitive agreement
with respect to the Superior Proposal until the expiration of five (5)
business days following PFSs receipt of written notice advising PFS that FSBI
has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and including a copy thereof with
all accompanying documentation, if in writing) identifying the person making
the Superior Proposal and stating whether FSBI intends to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal. After providing
such notice, FSBI shall provide a reasonable opportunity to PFS during the
five-day period to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable FSBI to proceed with the Merger on such adjusted
terms.



11.1.10. By FSBI, if its Board of Directors so determines by a majority vote
of the members of its entire Board, at any time during the five business-day
period commencing on the Determination Date if both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 



(i) The PFS Market Value on the Determination Date is less than $16.30,
adjusted as indicated on the last sentence of this Section 11.1.10; and



(ii) the number obtained by dividing the PFS Market Value on the Determination
Date by the Initial PFS Market Value ("PFS Ratio") shall be less than the
quotient obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by the Initial Index
Price, minus 0.175;



 

51 subject, however, to the following three sentences. If FSBI elects to exercise
its termination right pursuant to this Section 11.1.10, it shall give prompt
written notice thereof to PFS. During the fifth business day period commencing
with its receipt of such notice, PFS shall have the option to increase the
consideration to be received by the holders of FSBI Common Stock who elect to
receive PFS Common Stock hereunder by adjusting the Exchange Ratio to one of
the following quotients at its sole discretion: (i) a quotient, the numerator
of which is equal to the product of the Initial PFS Market Value, the
Exchange Ratio (as then in effect), and the Index Ratio minus 0.175, and the
denominator of which is equal to PFS Market Value on the Determination Date;
or (ii) the quotient determined by dividing the Initial PFS Market Value by
the PFS Market Value on the Determination Date, and multiplying the quotient
by the product of the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and 0.80. If PFS so
elects, it shall give, within such five business-day period, written notice to
FSBI of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no
termination shall be deemed to have occurred pursuant to this Section 11.1.10
and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with
its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified).



For purposes of this Section 11.1.10, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated below:



"Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (i) a merger or consolidation, or any
similar transaction, involving the relevant companies, (ii) a purchase, lease
or other acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the relevant companies, (iii) a purchase or other acquisition (including by
way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of securities
representing 10% or more of the voting power of the relevant companies; or
(iv) an agreement or commitment by the relevant companies to take any action
referenced above.



"Determination Date" shall mean the first date on which all Regulatory
Approvals (and waivers, if applicable) necessary for consummation of the
Merger have been received (disregarding any waiting period). 



"Final Index Price" means the sum of the Final Prices for each company
comprising the Index Group multiplied by the weighting set forth opposite such
companys name in the definition of Index Group below.



"Final Price," with respect to any company belonging to the Index Group, means
the average of the daily closing sales prices of a share of common stock of
such company (and if there is no closing sales price on any such day, then the
mean between the closing bid and the closing asked prices on that day), as
reported on the consolidated transaction reporting system for the market or
exchange on which such common stock is principally traded, for the twenty
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Determination Date.



 

52 "Index Group" means the financial institution holding companies listed below,
the common stock of all of which shall be publicly traded and as to which
there shall not have been an Acquisition Transaction involving such company
publicly announced at any time during the period beginning on the date of this
Agreement and ending on the Determination Date. In the event that the common
stock of any such company ceases to be publicly traded or an Acquisition
Proposal for such company to be acquired, or for such company to acquire

B-2 EXHIBIT C

AFFILIATES AGREEMENT



December  , 2003



Provident Financial Services, Inc.

 

830 Bergen Avenue

Jersey City, New Jersey



Gentlemen:



I have been advised that I might be considered to be an "affiliate" of First
Sentinel Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("FSBI"), for purposes of
paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act").



Provident Financial Services, Inc. ("Provident Financial Services") and FSBI
have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 19,
2003 (the "Agreement"). Upon consummation of the merger contemplated by the
Agreement (the "Merger"), I may receive shares of common stock of Provident
Financial Services ("Provident Financial Services Common Stock") in exchange
for my shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of FSBI ("FSBI Common
Stock"). This agreement is hereinafter referred to as the "Letter Agreement."



I represent and warrant to, and agree with, Provident Financial Services as
follows:



1\. I have read this Letter Agreement and the Agreement and have discussed
their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell,
pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of shares of Provident Financial
Services Common Stock that I may receive pursuant to the Merger, to the
extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for FSBI.



2\. I have been advised that any issuance of shares of Provident Financial
Services Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger will be registered with
the SEC. I have also been advised, however, that, because I may be an
"affiliate" of FSBI at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the
stockholders of FSBI and my disposition of such shares has not been registered
under the Securities Act, I must hold such shares indefinitely unless (i)
such disposition of such shares is subject to an effective registration
statement and to the availability of a prospectus under the Securities Act,
(ii) a sale of such shares is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule
145(d) under the Securities Act, (iii) a sale of such shares is made following
expiration of the restrictive period set forth in Rule 145(d)(2) or (3) or
(iv) in an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Provident Financial Services, such disposition of such shares is otherwise
exempt from registration under the Securities Act.



3\. I understand and agree that stop transfer instructions will be given to
the transfer agent of Provident Financial Services with respect to the
shares of Provident Financial Services Common Stock I receive pursuant to the
Merger and that there will be placed on the certificate representing such
shares, or any certificates delivered in substitution therefor, a legend
stating in substance: 



The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to
which Rule 145 under the Securities Act applies. The shares represented by
this certificate may only be transferred in accordance with Rule 145(d) or an
effective registration statement or exemption from registration under
the Securities Act.



4\. Provident Financial Services reserves the right to put an appropriate
legend on the certificate issued to my transferee unless (i) a transfer of my
shares of the Provident Financial Services Common Stock is a sale made in
conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) or made pursuant to
any effective registration statement under the Securities Act, or (ii) I
shall have delivered to Provident Financial Services, Inc. an opinion of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to Provident Financial Services to the effect
that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act.



 

C-1 5\. I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my
spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouses occupying my home, (iii) any
trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10%
beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in
any similar capacity and (iv) any corporation or other organization in which
I, my spouse and any such relative collectively own at least 10% of any class
of equity securities or of the equity interest.



6\. I further recognize that in the event I become a director or officer of
Provident Financial Services upon consummation of the Merger, any sale of
Provident Financial Services Common Stock by me may subject me to liability
pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.



7\. Execution of this Letter Agreement should not be construed as an admission
on my part that I am an "affiliate" of FSBI as described in the first
paragraph of this Letter Agreement or as a waiver of any rights I may have to
object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this
Letter Agreement.



It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and
be of no further force and effect if the Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms. It is also understood and agreed that this Letter
Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect and the stop
transfer instructions set forth above shall be lifted forthwith upon the
delivery by the undersigned to Provident Financial Services of an opinion of
counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Provident Financial
Services, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Provident Financial
Services, to the effect that a transfer of my shares of Provident Financial
Services Common Stock will not violate the Securities Act or any of the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder. In addition, it is understood and
agreed that the legend set forth in Paragraph 3 above shall be removed
forthwith from the certificate or certificates representing my shares of
Provident Financial Services Common Stock upon (i) expiration of the
restrictive period set forth in Rule 145(d)(2), so long as Provident
Financial Services is then in compliance with SEC Rule 144(c), or the
restrictive period set forth in Rule 145(d)(3) or (ii) if Provident Financial
Services shall have received an opinion of counsel in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Provident Financial Services, or other evidence
satisfactory to Provident Financial Services that a transfer of my shares of
the Provident Financial Services Common Stock represented by such certificate
or certificates will be a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule
145(d), made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act or made pursuant to an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act. __



* * * * * 



By acceptance hereof, Provident Financial Services agrees that, for a
period of two years after the effective time of the Merger, so long as it is
obligated to file reports pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, it will use its reasonable best efforts to
timely file such reports so that the public information requirements of Rule
144(c) promulgated under the Securities Act are satisfied and the resale
provisions of Rule 145(d)(1) and (2) are therefore available to me if I desire
to transfer Provident Financial Services Common Stock issued to me in the
Merger.



This Letter Agreement shall be binding on my heirs, legal representatives and
successors.



    Very truly yours, 
---
