Perfected Dissenting Share will be converted into the rights provided under
the Appraisal Laws in accordance with the Appraisal Laws (and shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist as of
the Effective Time), unless the holder thereof withdraws his or her demand
for payment, in which case each such share (a " _Withdrawn Dissenting_ _Share_
") shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right
to receive from Purchaser the

 



4  Per-Share Cash Consideration, without any interest (and shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist as of the
Effective Time). To the extent that a holder of Proposed Dissenting Shares
fails to perfect such holders dissenters rights under the Appraisal Laws,
such Proposed Dissenting Shares shall be treated as Withdrawn Dissenting
Shares under this Agreement. Each holder of Perfected Dissenting Shares who
becomes entitled to payment for his or her Company Common Stock pursuant to
the provisions of the Appraisal Laws shall receive payment for such Perfected
Dissenting Shares from Purchaser in accordance with the Appraisal
Laws. Company shall give Purchaser (i) prompt notice of any notice or demand
for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock received by
Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations

Stock whose holders provide notice of dissent to Company prior to the Company
Shareholder Meeting and do not vote in favor of the Merger, in each case in
accordance with Section 60.564 of the OBCA, in the event that, as set forth
in § 60.554(3) of the OBCA, shares of Company Common Stock were not registered
on a national securities exchange on either the record date of the Company
Shareholder Meeting or on the date of the Effective Time and dissenters
rights apply.

(g) _Earnings Adjustment to Cash Consideration._ If the Effective Time
does not occur on or prior to the later of the date that is six (6) months
following the date of this Agreement (the " _Six Months Date_ ") or April 1,
2013, and if Adjusted Companys Tangible Shareholders Equity is at least
$328,000,000, then an amount equal to the Companys earnings during the period
commencing the day after the Six Months Date and ending on the Closing Date
(excluding for the avoidance of doubt the amount of quarterly cash dividends
paid by the Company during such period, if any) shall be added to the Total
Cash Amount. " _Adjusted Company s Tangible Shareholders Equity_" shall be
calculated as set forth in _Exhibit 1.4(g)_ , including as to adjusting for
certain anticipated unaccrued transaction costs as set forth therein.

 

(h) _Company Series B Preferred Stock._ As provided by the terms of the
Series B Preferred Stock, each holder of outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred Stock shall have the right, at its option, to convert any or all of
such holders shares of Series B Preferred Stock into the Merger Consideration
as if such shares had been converted immediately prior to the Effective Time
into the number of shares of Company Common Stock into which such shares would
then be convertible assuming a Mandatory Conversion Date (as defined in the
terms of the Series B Preferred Stock) had occurred and shall be entitled to
the same right of election (and proration, subject to the proviso in the third
sentence of Section 1.5(c) with respect to proration allocations in respect of
holders of Class C Warrants who also hold shares of Series B Preferred Stock)
as holders of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, and without any
action on the part of any holder of a share of Series B Preferred Stock, each
share of Series B Preferred Stock that is then outstanding and as to which a
conversion election has not been made will remain outstanding and shall
convert into preference securities of Purchaser having rights (including, but
not limited to, the right of conversion), preferences, privileges and voting
powers that, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the
holders of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock than the rights,
preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series B Preferred Stock,
taken as a whole, immediately prior to the Effective Time (such preference
securities, the " _Equivalent Preferred Shares_ ").

1.5 _Company Stock Options_. Holders of outstanding and unexercised stock
options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under a Company
Stock Plan outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Company Stock Option_ ) and holders of Class C Warrants will be treated as
follows:

(a) _Company Stock Options Exercised Before Closing._ If any holder of a
Company Stock Option exercises such Company Stock Option after the date of
this Agreement and before the Effective Time, Company may either (i) issue
shares of Company Common Stock upon such exercise, which shares shall be
converted into the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time in accordance
with Section 1.4(b), or (ii) under Section 5(l) of the 2002 Stock Incentive
Plan, require the holder to cash out such Company Stock Option at the amount
specified thereunder.

 



5 (b) _Unexercised Stock Options._ At the Effective Time, and without any
action on the part of any holder of a Company Stock Option, each Company Stock
Option that is then outstanding and unexercised will be converted into and
become a vested option (a " _Converted Option_ ") to purchase Purchaser
Common Stock on the same terms and conditions (other than vesting, which shall
occur at the Effective Time) as are in effect with respect to the Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each
such Converted Option may be exercised solely for shares of Purchaser Common
Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock subject to such
Converted Option will be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share),
and (iii) the per-share exercise price for each such Converted Option will be
adjusted by dividing the per-share exercise price of the Company Stock Option
by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.5, a holder of a Company Stock
Option may, in accordance with the terms of the Companys 2002 Stock
Incentive Plan under which such Company Stock Option was granted, elect to
exchange such holders Converted Option for cash within sixty (60) days
following the Effective Time on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan.

(c) _Class C Warrants._ At the Effective Time, and without any action on
the part of any holder of a Class C Warrant, each Class C Warrant that is then
outstanding and unexercised will remain outstanding and, for purposes of
Section 1.4, will be deemed an equivalent warrant with rights to receive
Merger Consideration (an " _Equivalent Warrant_ ") on the same terms and
conditions as are in effect with respect to the Class C Warrant immediately
prior to the Effective Time. To clarify, each Class C Warrant will become
exercisable for Merger Consideration based on the Merger Consideration that
would have been received as if each Class C Warrant had been exercised for
Series B Preferred Stock and converted to Company Common Stock in accordance
with the terms thereof prior to the Effective Time. Purchaser shall cause
each holder of an Equivalent Warrant to receive, for purposes of electing to
receive Stock Election Shares, Cash Election Shares or Mixed Election Shares
upon future exercise of such Equivalent Warrant, an election statement at the
same time as holders of Exchangeable Shares receive Election Statements
pursuant to Section 2.1(a), and the Merger Consideration such holders shall
receive upon exercise shall be subject to the election and proration
procedures set forth in Section 2.1, _provided_ , _however_ , that proration
with respect to a holder of Class C Warrants shall aggregate all elections
made by such holder with respect to such holders shares of Company Common
Stock, shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Class C Warrants, and any
proration allocations, if any, arising as a result of the application of the
provisions of Section 2.1 shall be applied first to such holders shares of
Company Common Stock and second to such holders shares of Series B Preferred
Stock. For purposes of calculating an Equivalent Warrant for purposes of
Section 1.4, (i) the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock deemed
subject to such Equivalent Warrant will be equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock into which the shares of Series B Preferred Stock subject
to the Company Class C Warrant would be convertible (assuming they are
convertible) assuming conversion immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share), and
(ii) the per-share exercise price for each such Equivalent Warrant will be
adjusted by dividing the per-share exercise price of the Company Class C
Warrant on a Company Common Stock equivalent basis by the Exchange Ratio
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent).

1.6 _Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each share of Company
Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restrictions
granted under a Company Stock Plan (each, a " _Company Restricted Share_ ")
shall vest in full and become free of such restrictions, and any repurchase
right shall lapse and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration with respect to each such Company Restricted Share in
accordance with Section 1.4(b), less applicable taxes and withholding.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Stock Plans_ " means the Companys
2002 Stock Incentive Plan and the Companys 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan.

1.7 _Company Board Action_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of Company and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
of Company, as applicable, shall adopt any necessary resolutions to
effectuate the provisions of Sections 1.5 and 1.6.

 



6 1.8 _Converted Options and Class C Warrants_. Purchaser shall, as of
the Effective Time, assume the obligations of Company under the Class C
Warrants and the Company Stock Plans and agreements pursuant to which a
Company Stock Option has been issued and shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Converted Options and Class C
Warrants. Purchaser shall cause the registration of the shares of Purchaser
Common Stock subject to the Converted Options to become effective as part of
a registration statement on Form S-8, or any successor or other appropriate
forms, with respect to the shares of Purchaser Common Stock subject to the
Converted Options no later than thirty (30) days after the Effective Time;
and, thereafter, Purchaser shall deliver to holders of Converted Options any
applicable prospectus and shall maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements, including the current
status of any related prospectus, for so long as the Converted Options remain
outstanding.

1.9 _Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, Directors and Officers of the
Surviving Corporation_. As of the Effective Time, (a) the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until duly amended in accordance with the terms thereof and
applicable law, and (b) the directors and officers of Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the
Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors
are duly appointed and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or
removal.

1.10 _Purchaser Board of Directors_. From and after the Effective Time,
the Board of Directors of Purchaser shall consist of the persons serving on
the Board of Directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time,
plus the member of the Board of Directors of Company selected pursuant to
Section 6.12.

 

1.11 _The Second Step Merger_. On the Closing Date and as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, in accordance with the
Washington Business Corporation Act (the " _WBCA_ ") and the OBCA, Purchaser
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to be merged with and into Purchaser in
the Second Step Merger, with Purchaser surviving the Second Step Merger and
continuing its existence under the laws of the State of Washington, and the
separate corporate existence of the Surviving Corporation ceasing as of the
effective time of the Second Step Merger. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Purchaser shall cause to be filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Washington (the " _Washington Secretary_ "), in accordance with
the WBCA, articles of merger (" _Washington Articles of Merger_ ") relating
to the Second Step Merger and shall cause to be filed with the Oregon
Secretary, in accordance with the OBCA, articles of merger relating to the
Second Step Merger. The Second Step Merger shall become effective as of the
date and time specified in the Washington Articles of Merger and by the
issuance of a Certificate of Merger by the Washington Secretary. At and after
the effective time of the Second Step Merger, the Second Step Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the WBCA and the
OBCA.

ARTICLE II.

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

2.1 _Election and Proration Procedures_.

(a) Purchaser shall cause an election statement permitting each holder of
an Exchangeable Share the ability to elect consideration pursuant to Section
2.1(b) and subject to 2.1(e) (the " _Election Statement_ ") to be mailed with
the Joint Proxy Statement on the date of mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement to each holder of record of Company Common Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and Class C Warrants as of the record date for the Company
Shareholder Meeting (the " _Record Date_ ").

 

(b) Each Election Statement shall permit the holder to elect to receive (i)
the Per Share Stock Consideration in respect of all of such holders
Exchangeable Shares (" _Stock Election Shares_ "); (ii) the Per Share Cash
Consideration in respect of all of such holders Exchangeable Shares (" _Cash
Election Shares_ "); or (iii) the

 



7  Per Share Stock Consideration in respect of that portion of such holders
Exchangeable Shares equal to the Stock Percentage, rounded to the nearest
whole share (the " _Mixed Stock Shares_ "), and the Per Share Cash
Consideration in respect of that portion of such holders Exchangeable Shares
equal to the Cash Percentage, rounded to the nearest whole share (the " _Mixed
Cash Shares_ ," and together with the Mixed Stock Shares, the " _Mixed
Election Shares_ "). If a holder makes no election with respect to such
holders Exchangeable Shares, or if there are any Exchangeable Shares with
respect to which the Exchange Agent has not otherwise received an effective,
properly completed Election Statement on or before 5:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on
the date prior to the Determination Date (or such other time and date as
Purchaser and Company may mutually agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ "), such
shares shall be deemed to be " _No Election Shares_."

 

" _Cash Percentage_ " shall mean the amount obtained by dividing the Total
Cash Amount by the Aggregate Consideration. 

" _Stock Percentage_ " shall mean the amount equal to one (1) minus the Cash
Percentage.

 

(c) Purchaser shall make available one or more Election Statements as may
reasonably be requested from time to time by all persons who become holders
(or beneficial owners) of Company Common Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or
Class C Warrants between the Election Statement Record Date and the close of
business on the business day prior to the Election Deadline, and Company
shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for
it to perform as specified herein.

(d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Statement by
the Election Deadline, and such election is not revoked or changed prior to
the Election Deadline. Any Election Statement may be revoked or changed by the
person submitting such Election Statement at or prior to the Election
Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election
Statement, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine
whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made
and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Statements, and any
good faith decisions of Purchaser regarding such matters shall be binding and
conclusive. Neither Purchaser nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any
obligation to notify any person of any defect in an Election Statement. To the
extent the holder of Proposed Dissenting Shares submits an Election
Statement, such holders election shall have no effect, the Exchange Agent
will disregard such Election Statement, and the Proposed Dissenting Shares
shall be converted in accordance with Section 1.4(f).

(e) Within ten (10) business days after the Election Deadline, unless
the Effective Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon thereafter as
practicable, Purchaser shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation
among the holders of Exchangeable Shares of rights to receive Purchaser Common
Stock or cash in the Merger in accordance with the Election Statements as
follows:

(i) _Cash Election Shares, Proposed Dissenting Shares and Mixed Cash
Shares More Than Total Cash Amount_. If the aggregate cash amount that would
be paid upon the conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares,
Proposed Dissenting Shares and the Mixed Cash Shares is greater than the
Total Cash Amount, then:

(1) all Mixed Stock Shares, Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration;

 

(2) all Proposed Dissenting Shares shall be deemed, for the purposes of
this Section 2.1(e)(i), to be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Cash Consideration;

(3) the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election
Shares, by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares ("
_Stock Designated Shares_ ") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be
paid in the Merger equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount,
and all Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Stock Consideration; and

 



8 (4) the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares and all
Mixed Cash Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration.

 

(ii) _Cash Election Shares, Proposed Dissenting Shares and Mixed Cash
Shares Less Than Total Cash Amount_. If the aggregate cash amount that would
be paid upon conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares, Proposed
Dissenting Shares and the Mixed Cash Shares is less than the Total Cash
Amount, then:

 

(1) all Cash Election Shares and Mixed Cash Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration;

(2) all Proposed Dissenting Shares shall be deemed, for the purposes of
this Section 2.2(e)(ii), to be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Cash Consideration;

 

(3) the Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the No Election
Shares and then (if necessary) from among the Stock Election Shares, by a pro
rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares (" _Cash Designated
Shares_ ") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger
equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount, and all Cash
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration; and

(4) the Stock Election Shares and the No Election Shares that are not Cash
Designated Shares and all Mixed Stock Shares shall be converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration.

(iii) _Cash Election Shares, Proposed Dissenting Shares and Mixed Cash
Shares Equal to Total Cash Amount_. If the aggregate cash amount that would
be paid upon conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares, Proposed
Dissenting Shares and the Mixed Cash Shares is equal or nearly equal (as
determined by the Exchange Agent) to the Total Cash Amount, then
subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall not apply, and all Cash Election Shares
and Mixed Cash Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Cash Consideration, and all Stock Election Shares, Mixed Stock Shares
and No Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Stock Consideration, and all Proposed Dissenting Shares shall be
converted in accordance with Section 1.4(f).

 

(f) The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall
consist of such equitable proration processes consistent with the foregoing
and as shall be determined in good faith by Purchaser and reasonably
satisfactory to Company.

 

2.2 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Purchaser shall (a) authorize an exchange agent, which person shall be a bank
or trust company selected by Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to Company
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "), pursuant to an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent
Agreement_ ") entered into at least ten (10) business days prior to the
Effective Time, to deliver an aggregate number of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock that is equal to the Total Stock Pool and an amount in cash which is
equal to the Total Cash Pool and (b) deposit, or cause to be deposited with,
the Exchange Agent, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3(f) (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

2.3 _Exchange Procedures for Exchangeable Shares_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any
event within five (5) business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail
to (x) each holder of record of Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares which,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4, and (y) each holder of record
of Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares which, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented Company Restricted Shares, Series B Preferred
Stock or Class C Warrants that were converted (in the case of Series B
Preferred Stock and Class C Warrants, at the election of the holders thereof)
in accordance with the respective terms of such securities into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration ((x) and (y) collectively, the " _Exchanged
Shares_ "), along with, in each case, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of

 



9  Purchaser Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares shall pass,
only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
Certificate(s))) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be
substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be
prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ")
and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor and any dividends or distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c).

 

(b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or Book-
Entry Shares, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a
holder of Exchanged Shares will be entitled to receive promptly after the
Effective Time but in any event within ten (10) business days after such
surrender, the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor in respect of the Exchanged Shares represented by its
Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares. Until so surrendered, each such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall represent after the Effective Time,
for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the applicable
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser
Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with, and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II.

 

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Purchaser Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares with respect to the shares of Purchaser Common Stock represented
thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of
any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II,
the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i)
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of
Purchaser Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and
paid prior to such surrender date, and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
shares of Purchaser Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender
date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Purchaser
Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares representing Exchanged Shares that are not registered in the stock
transfer records of Company, the shares of Purchaser Common Stock and cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock comprising the Merger
Consideration shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a person other
than the person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered is registered if the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing such Exchanged Shares shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment or
issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of
the payment or issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of Purchaser that the tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange
Agent (or, subsequent to the earlier of (x) the one-year anniversary of the
Effective Time and (y) the expiration or termination of the Exchange Agent
Agreement, Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation) shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common
Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Exchanged
Shares such amounts as the Exchange Agent, Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law, with respect to
the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the
Exchange Agent, Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Exchanged Shares in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Purchaser, as the case may be.

 



10 (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Company of the shares of Company Common Stock, Company
Restricted Shares, Series B Preferred Stock whose holders have elected to
convert such shares, Class C Warrants whose holders have exercised such
warrants, that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time other than to settle transfers of such Company Common Stock or Company
Restricted Shares, Series B Preferred Stock or Class C Warrants that occurred
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares representing such shares are presented for transfer to the
Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser
Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Article II.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
no fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for exchange, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Purchaser Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of Purchaser. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Purchaser shall pay to each former shareholder of Company who otherwise
would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash
(rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) Purchaser Average
Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all
shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and
rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of
Purchaser Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 1.4.

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Company as of the one (1) year anniversary of the Effective
Time will be transferred to Purchaser. In such event, any former shareholders
of Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Purchaser with respect to the Merger Consideration,
any cash in lieu of any fractional shares, and any unpaid dividends and
distributions on the Purchaser Common Stock deliverable in respect of each
Exchangeable Share such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(h) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required
by Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond
in such amount as Purchaser may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE III.

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

Except as (a) Previously Disclosed or (b) disclosed in any report, schedule,
form or other document filed with, or furnished to, the SEC by Company prior
to the date hereof and on or after the date on which Company filed with the
SEC its Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2010
(but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," or disclosure of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Company hereby
represents and warrants to Purchaser and Sub as follows: 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

(a) _Organization._ Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Oregon. Company
has the requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease

 



11  all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, and, except as would not reasonably be expected, individually
or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company, is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary. Company is duly registered as a bank holding company under the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956 (" _BHC Act_ ").

(b) _Articles and Bylaws._ True, complete and correct copies of the
Restated Articles of Incorporation of Company, as amended (the " _Company
Articles_ "), and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Company (the " _Company
Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously
been publicly filed by Company and made available to Purchaser.

 

(c) _Subsidiaries._ Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a list of all Subsidiaries of the Company (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, includes any Subsidiaries of such Subsidiaries) and a description of
the business of each Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Subsidiary that the
Company considers to be "inactive," a statement to that effect and a
description of the business previously conducted by such Subsidiary). Except
as otherwise noted on Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each
Subsidiary of Company (i) is duly incorporated or duly formed, as applicable
to each such Subsidiary, and validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) has the requisite corporate (or

business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary. There are no
restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of Company to pay dividends or
distributions to Company, except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a
regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally
applicable to all such regulated entities. As used in this Agreement, the
term " _Subsidiary_ " has the meaning ascribed to it in Section 2(d) of the
BHC Act, except that when such term is used with respect to an entity that is
not a bank holding company, the meaning shall nonetheless be deemed to apply
to such entity. The deposit accounts of each of its Subsidiaries that is an
insured depository institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the
fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to be
paid in connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for
the termination of such insurance are pending or, to the Knowledge of
Company, threatened. True, complete and correct copies of the articles of
incorporation, bylaws and similar governing documents of each Subsidiary of
Company as in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement have
been provided to Purchaser.

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Company consists of 50,000,000 shares

(including Company Restricted Shares), and 121,328 shares of Series B
Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. As of the Company Capitalization

ownership thereof. As of the date of this Agreement, no bonds, debentures,
notes or other indebtedness having the right to vote on any matters on which
shareholders of Company may vote (" _Voting Debt_ ") are issued or
outstanding. The Board of Directors of Company has taken all action necessary
to exempt this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby
from triggering the exercise of purchase rights under the Companys Tax
Benefit Preservation Plan dated October 23, 2009. As of the Company
Capitalization Date, except pursuant to this Agreement, under the Company
Stock Plans or the terms of the Company Preferred Stock, the Class C Warrants
or the Companys Tax Benefit Preservation Plan, Company does not have and is
not bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or

Subsidiaries is or could be required to register shares of Company capital
stock or other securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "

voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which Company, any
Subsidiary of Company or, to the Knowledge of Company, any of their
respective officers or directors, is a party with respect to the voting of any
Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Voting Debt or other equity

(solely to the Knowledge of Company with respect to Company Preferred Stock
and warrants) (A) the name of such holder, (B) the number of shares subject to

warrants held by such holder, (C) as applicable, the grant date of each such
award, (D) as applicable, the vesting schedule of each such award, and (E) the

(b) Other than awards under the Company Stock Plans that are outstanding as

of the Company Capitalization Date. Since the Company Capitalization Date
through the date hereof, Company has not (i) issued or repurchased any shares
of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock, Voting Debt or other equity

Stock Options or Class C Warrants or conversion of Company Preferred Stock or

Company Capitalization Date or (ii) issued or awarded any options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units, deferred

terms of the 

 



13  applicable Company Stock Plan, the Exchange Act and all other applicable
Laws and (2) each such grant was properly accounted for in accordance with
GAAP in the financial statements (including the related notes) of Company and
disclosed in the Company SEC Reports in accordance with the Exchange Act and
all other applicable Laws. All Company Stock Options granted by Company or any
of its Subsidiaries have been granted with a per share exercise or reference
price at least equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the
date the option or stock appreciation right was granted, within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code and associated Treasury Department guidance. From

its Subsidiaries has (A) accelerated the vesting of or lapsing of restrictions
with respect to any stock-based compensation awards or long-term incentive

Incentive Plan.

(c) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other
equity ownership interests of each Subsidiary of Company are owned by Company,
directly or indirectly, free and clear of any material liens, pledges,
charges, claims and security interests and similar encumbrances (" _Liens_ "),
and all of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights. No Subsidiary of Company has or is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any
character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock
or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing
the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any

governing documents and applicable law, except where the failure to so
administer such accounts would not reasonably be expected to have,

Trust Company, Inc. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on West Coast

3.11 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of each material employee benefit plan, program,
policy, practice, or other arrangement providing benefits to any current or
former employee, officer or director of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any beneficiary or dependent thereof that is sponsored or maintained by
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to which Company or any of its
Subsidiaries contributes or is obligated to contribute, whether or not
written, including, without limitation, any employee welfare benefit plan
within the meaning of Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), any employee pension benefit plan
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (whether or not such plan is
subject to ERISA) and any equity purchase plan, option, equity bonus, phantom
equity or other equity plan, profit sharing, bonus, retirement (including
compensation, pension, health, medical or life insurance benefits), deferred
compensation, excess benefit, incentive compensation, severance, change in
control or termination pay, hospitalization or other medical or dental, life
or other insurance (including any self-insured arrangements), supplemental
unemployment, salary continuation, sick leave or other leave of absence
benefits, short- or long-term disability, or vacation benefits plan or any
other

 



18  agreement or policy or other arrangement providing employee benefits,
employment-related compensation, fringe benefits or other benefits (whether
qualified or nonqualified, funded or unfunded) (whether or not listed in
Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each an " _Employee
Benefit Plan_ ").

(b) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, Company has delivered or
made available to Purchaser a true, correct and complete copy of: (i) each
writing constituting a part of such Employee Benefit Plan, including, without
limitation, all plan documents, employee communications, benefit schedules,
formal or informal trust agreements, and insurance contracts and other funding
vehicles; (ii) the most recent Annual Report (Form 5500 Series) and
accompanying schedule, if any; (iii) all investment policy statements or
guidelines, delegations and charters related to any Employee Benefit Plan;
(iv) the current summary plan description and any material modifications
thereto, if any; (v) the most recent annual financial report, if any; (vi) the
most recent actuarial report, if any; and (vii) the most recent determination
letter from the IRS, if any. Except as specifically provided in the foregoing
documents delivered or made available to Purchaser, there are no amendments to
any Employee Benefit Plan that have been adopted or approved nor has Company
or any of its Subsidiaries undertaken to make any such amendments or to
adopt or approve any new Employee Benefit Plan. No Employee Benefit Plan is
maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United States, or covers any
employee residing or working outside of the United States.

 

(c) Each Employee Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of
the Code and each related trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of
the Code either has received a favorable determination, opinion, notification
or advisory letter from the IRS with respect to each such Employee Benefit
Plan as to its qualified status under the Code, including all amendments to
the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation for
the most recent cycle applicable to such qualified plan pursuant to Revenue
Procedure 2005-66 (as amended or otherwise revised by subsequent IRS
guidance), any such letter has not been revoked (nor has revocation been
threatened) and no fact or event has occurred since the date of such letter or
letters from the IRS that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Employee Benefit Plan or the exempt status of
any such trust.

(d) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, Company and its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects, and are now in
substantial compliance with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and
regulations applicable to such Employee Benefit Plans and each Employee
Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects in accordance with
its terms. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, there is not now, nor do
any circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to give rise to,
any requirement for the posting of security with respect to any Employee
Benefit Plan or the imposition of any lien on the assets of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any applicable
Employee Benefit Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction
expired as of the date hereof, could subject the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material.

 

(e) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, all contributions required to be made to any Employee Benefit Plan by
applicable law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any Employee Benefit Plan, for any period through the date
hereof have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to
be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the
financial statements. Each Employee Benefit Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA is either (i) funded through
an insurance company contract and is not a "welfare benefit fund" with the
meaning of Section 419 of the Code or (ii) unfunded.

 

(f) (i) No Employee Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a plan
that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under
common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple
Employer Plan_ ");

 



19  (ii) none of Company or its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been
obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan;
(iii) none of Company and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied
in full; and (iv) no Employee Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV or Section
302 of ERISA. " _ERISA Affiliate_ " means, with respect to any entity, trade
or business, any other entity, trade or business that is a member of a group
described in Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section
4001(b)(1) of ERISA that includes the first entity, trade or business, or that
is a member of the same "controlled group" as the first entity, trade or
business pursuant to Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA. "Withdrawal Liability"
means liability to a Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial
withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan, as those terms are defined in Part I
of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA.

(g) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, there does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could
result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of Company
or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates following the
Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has
engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212
of ERISA. " _Controlled Group Liability_ " means any and all liabilities (i)
under Title IV of ERISA, (ii) under section 302 of ERISA, (iii) under sections
412 and 4971 of the Code, (iv) as a result of a failure to comply with the
continuation coverage requirements of section 601 et seq. of ERISA and
section 4980B of the Code, and (v) under corresponding or similar provisions
of foreign laws or regulations.

(h) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, none of Company and its Subsidiaries has any liability for life,
health, medical or other welfare benefits to former employees or
beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except for health continuation coverage
as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and at
no expense to Company and its Subsidiaries. Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has reserved the right to amend, terminate or modify at any time
all plans or arrangements providing for post-retirement welfare benefits.

(i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, there are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for
benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have been
asserted or instituted, or to the Knowledge of Company, no set of
circumstances exists which may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit
against the Employee Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to
their duties to the Employee Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts
under any of the Employee Benefit Plans which could reasonably be expected to
result in a material liability of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the
U.S. Department of the Treasury (the " _Treasury Department_ "), the U.S.
Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, any Employee Benefit Plan or any
participant in an Employee Benefit Plan. Neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken any action to take corrective action or make a filing
under any voluntary correction program of the IRS, the U.S. Department of
Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any Employee Benefit
Plan, and neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of
any material plan defect that would qualify for correction under any such
program.

 

(j) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is or was a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and
associated Treasury Department guidance has (i) been operated between January
1, 2005 and December 31, 2008, in good faith compliance in all material
respects with Section 409A of the Code and Notice 2005-01 and (ii) since
January 1, 2009 (or such later date permitted under applicable guidance), been
operated in compliance with, and is in documentary compliance with, in all
material respects, Section 409A of the Code and IRS regulations and guidance
thereunder. No compensation payable by Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
been reportable as nonqualified deferred compensation in the gross income of
any individual or entity, and subject to an additional tax, as a result of
the operation of Section 409A of the Code and, except as set forth on Section
3.11(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, no arrangement exists with
respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that would result in
income inclusion under Section 409A(b) of the Code.

 



20 (k) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or
together with any other event or events, will (i) result in any payment
(including, without limitation, severance, golden parachute, forgiveness of
indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due under any Employee Benefit Plan,
whether or not such payment is contingent, (ii) increase any payments or
benefits otherwise payable under any Employee Benefit Plan, (iii) result in
the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any benefits
including, but not limited to, the acceleration of the vesting and
exercisability of any equity awards, whether or not contingent, (iv) result in
any limitation on the right of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend,
merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Employee Benefit
Plan or related trust, or (v) require the funding of any trust or other
funding vehicle. There is no agreement, contract or arrangement to
which Company is a party that could, individually or collectively, result in
the payment of any amount that would not be deductible by reason of Section
280G of the Code, as determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the
Code. Except as set forth on Section 3.11(k) of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, no Employee Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement
of Taxes under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code, or otherwise.

 

(l) Each individual who renders services to Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who is classified by Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable,
as having the status of an independent contractor or other non-employee status
for any purpose (including for purposes of taxation and tax reporting and
under Employee Benefit Plans) is properly so characterized. 

3.12 _Approvals_. As of the date of this Agreement, Company knows of no
reason why all regulatory approvals from any Governmental Entity required for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement should not
be obtained on a timely basis.

3.13 _Opinion_. The Board of Directors of Company has received the opinion
of Sandler ONeill + Partners, LP that, as of the date of such opinion, and
based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the
Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Common Stock in the
Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

 

3.14 _Company Information_. The information relating to Company and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by Company or its representatives for inclusion
in the Joint Proxy Statement and Form S-4, or in any application, notification
or other document filed with any other Regulatory Agency or other Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The portions of the
Joint Proxy Statement relating to Company and its Subsidiaries and other
portions within the reasonable control of Company and its Subsidiaries will

former directors or executive officers of it or any of its Subsidiaries (and
it is not aware of any basis for any such suit, action or proceeding) (i)
that involves a Governmental Entity, or (ii) that, individually or in the
aggregate, and, in either case, is (A) material to it and its Subsidiaries,

the business of Purchaser, Surviving Corporation or any of their affiliates,
or (B) reasonably likely to materially prevent or delay it from performing
its obligations under, or consummating the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement. There is no material injunction, order, award, judgment,
settlement, decree or regulatory restriction imposed upon or entered into by
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of it or any of its
Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger, would apply to
Purchaser or any of its affiliates).

(ii) sales, transfers, mortgages, encumbrances, licenses, lapses,
cancellations, abandonments or other dispositions or discontinuances in the
ordinary course of business and in a transaction that, together with all other

all or any material portion of the assets, business, deposits or properties of
any other entity except in the ordinary course of business and in a
transaction that, together with all other such transactions, is not material
to it and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and would not reasonably be
expected to present a material risk that the Closing Date will be materially
delayed or that the Requisite Regulatory Approvals will be more difficult
to obtain.

liability management and other banking and operating policies, except as

likely to be material to it or its Subsidiaries.

this Agreement which have been Previously Disclosed, pay, loan or advance any
amount to, or sell, transfer or lease any properties, rights or assets (real,

conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
such third parties or Governmental Entities. Company and Purchaser shall have
the right to review in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will
consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws, all the non-
confidential information relating to Company or Purchaser (excluding any
confidential financial information relating to individuals), as the case may
be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and
as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with
respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party
shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any

other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Purchaser, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Each of Purchaser and Company agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the
time the Form S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Joint
Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to shareholders and at the time of Companys meeting of its
shareholders to consider and vote upon approval of this Agreement, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not
misleading. Each of Purchaser and Company further agrees that if it becomes
aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements
in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the
other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the Form S-4
or the Joint Proxy Statement.

or eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable law and resolve
any questions or issues raised by any Governmental Entity so as to enable the

raising capital, divesting or otherwise disposing of businesses or assets of
Purchaser, Company and their respective Subsidiaries, effecting the
dissolution, internal merger or consolidation of Subsidiaries of Purchaser or
the Company effective upon the Effective Time, or enhancing internal controls
(including by increasing staffing levels and external hires). 

 



47 (e) Each of Purchaser and Company shall promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or
approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is
a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be
obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed.

 

6.2 _Access to Information_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives
of Purchaser, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records, and, during such period, Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Purchaser (i) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed
or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal
securities laws or federal or state banking or insurance laws (other than
reports or documents that Company is not permitted to disclose under
applicable law), (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Purchaser may reasonably request and (iii) access
to the necessary information (including the Companys own good faith estimates
as available and third-party reports, if any, commissioned by Company at
Purchasers request) in order to prepare a good faith estimate of the
potential impact of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code with respect to amounts
potentially payable to senior executives of Company in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Upon the
reasonable request of Company, Purchaser shall furnish such reasonable
information about it and its business as is relevant to Company and its
shareholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including such title reports and environmental reports pertaining
to Company Real Property not previously made available to Purchaser. Neither
Company nor Purchaser, nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information to the extent such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or its
Subsidiaries (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common
interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.
The parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) All nonpublic information and materials provided pursuant to this
Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
entered into between the parties dated April 23, 2012 (the " _Confidentiality

or be deemed to modify or waive any representations, warranties or covenants
of the other party set forth in this Agreement.

Companys shareholders that they approve this Agreement (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ ") and, subject to Sections 6.8(b)-(c) and 8.1(d), will submit
to its shareholders this Agreement and any other matters required to be
approved by its shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of this
Agreement. Subject to Section 8.1(d), Company shall duly take, in accordance
with applicable law and the Company Articles and Company Bylaws, all action
necessary to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its

obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (the " _Company
Shareholder Meeting_ "). Subject to Sections 6.8(b)-(c) and 8.1(d), the Board
of Directors of Company will include in the Joint Proxy Statement the Company
Board Recommendation and use all reasonable best efforts to obtain from its
shareholders the Company Shareholder

 



48  Approval. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms,
including pursuant to Section 8.1(d) hereof, nothing otherwise contained in
this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Company of its obligation to submit
this Agreement to its shareholders for a vote.

(b) The Board of Directors of Purchaser has resolved to recommend to
Purchasers shareholders that they approve the issuance of Purchaser Common
Stock in connection with the Merger for purposes of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635
(the " _Purchaser Board Recommendation_ "), and will submit to its
shareholders the proposed issuance of Purchaser Common Stock and any other
matters required to be approved by its shareholders in order to carry out the
intentions of this Agreement. Purchaser shall duly take, in accordance with
applicable law and the governing organization documents of Purchaser, all
action necessary to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
shareholders, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act by the SEC, for the purpose of
obtaining the Purchaser Shareholder Approval (the " _Purchaser Shareholder
Meeting_ "). The Board of Directors of Purchaser will include in the
Joint Proxy Statement the Purchaser Board Recommendation and use all
reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders the Purchaser
Shareholder Approval. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
relieve Purchaser of its obligation to submit this Agreement to its
shareholders to a vote.

(c) Company and Purchaser shall cooperate to schedule and convene the
Company Shareholder Meeting and the Purchaser Shareholder Meeting on the same
date.

 

(d) If on the date of the Company Shareholder Meeting, Company has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common
Stock to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, Company shall adjourn the
Company Shareholder Meeting until such date as shall be mutually agreed upon
by Company and Purchaser, which date shall not be less than five (5) days nor
more than 10 days after the date of adjournment, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall continue to use all reasonable best
efforts, together with its proxy solicitor, to assist in the solicitation
of proxies from shareholders relating to the Company Shareholder Approval.
Company shall only be required to adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholder
Meeting one time pursuant to this Section 6.3(d).

 

(e) If on the date of the Purchaser Shareholder Meeting, Purchaser has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Purchaser

adjourn the Purchaser Shareholder Meeting until such date as shall be mutually
agreed upon by Company and Purchaser, which date shall not be less than five
(5) days nor more than 10 days after the date of adjournment, and subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall continue to use all
reasonable best efforts, together with its proxy solicitor, to assist in
the solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating to the Purchaser
Shareholder Approval. Purchaser shall only be required to adjourn or postpone
the Purchaser Shareholder Meeting one time pursuant to this Section 6.3(e).

 

6.4 _Nasdaq Listing_. Purchaser shall cause the shares of Purchaser Common
Stock (including for the avoidance of doubt the shares of Purchaser Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of the Class C Warrants or conversion of the
Series B Preferred Stock) to be issued in the Merger to have been authorized
for listing on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, subject to official notice
of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

6.5 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Effective Time, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each employee who is
actively employed by Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (each a
" _Continuing Employee_ ") while employed by Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time with: (i) base salary and bonus
opportunities consistent with base salary and bonus opportunities provided to
Purchaser employees who perform similar roles and have
similar responsibilities; and (ii) employee benefits which, in the aggregate,
are no less favorable than employee benefits provided by Purchaser to
similarly situated employees of

 



49  Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that until such time as Purchaser shall
cause Continuing Employees to participate in the benefit plans of Purchaser, a
Continuing Employees continued participation in the Employee Benefit Plans
shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provision of this sentence (it being
understood that participation in Purchaser benefit plans may commence at
different times with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan). Accordingly,
Company shall cooperate with Purchaser to ensure that from the Closing Date
through the next open enrollment date for Purchasers group health, dental,
vision and life insurance plans, the Continuing Employees shall continue to
be covered by Companys group health, dental, vision and life insurance plans;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Company shall terminate, effective as of the
Effective Time, its plans and programs with respect to long term care
and health savings accounts. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, maintain
the severance policy of Company and its Subsidiaries applicable to Continuing
Employees without amendment during the one-year period following the
Effective Time (the " _Company Severance Plan_ ") and provide each Continuing
Employee who is not party to an individual employment or change of control
agreement at the time of his or her termination of employment whose
employment is terminated (other than under circumstances that constitute a
termination for "cause") with the severance payments and benefits to which the
Continuing Employee would have been entitled under the Company Severance Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time, taking into account the Continuing
Employees length of service with Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in
Section 6.5(b).

 

(b) Upon Continuing Employees enrollment in Purchasers employee benefit
plans, such Continuing Employees will, consistent with the provisions of
Section 6.5(a) above, become participants in all Purchasers employee benefit
plans, practices, and policies on the same terms and conditions as similarly
situated employees of Purchaser. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, prior service credit for each of Continuing Employees service with
Company, except as expressly provided otherwise herein, shall be given by
Purchaser with respect to all Purchasers retirement plans, employee benefit
plans, practices, and policies to the extent that such crediting of service
does not result in duplication of benefits, but not for accrual of benefits
under any defined benefit. If any Continuing Employee becomes eligible to
participate in any Purchaser employee benefit plan, practice, or policy that
provides medical, hospitalization or dental benefits, Purchaser shall (A)
cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods
under such Purchaser benefit plan to be waived with respect to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such
limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Employee Benefit Plan
in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (B) recognize any health expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents in the year that
includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Continuing
Employee is first eligible to participate) for purposes of any applicable
deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such
Purchaser benefit plan.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, subject to the requirements of
applicable Law, Purchaser shall assume the employment and change in control
arrangements of Continuing Employees who were employed with Company or its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement and who continue such employment
through the Effective Time; _provided_ , that any changes that were made to
such employment or change in control arrangements after July 31, 2012 shall
have been discussed with and approved by Purchaser prior to their
effectiveness.

 

(d) If the Effective Time occurs after December 31, 2012 and prior to
December 31, 2013, then Company shall pay each Continuing Employee who
participates in an incentive compensation program maintained by Company or any
of its Subsidiaries a prorated bonus relating to 2013 performance with
performance deemed to have been achieved at target level immediately prior to
the Closing Date.

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Companys Board of Directors (or the
appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as is necessary to terminate the Companys 401(k) plan (the " _Company
401(k) Plan_ ") and to ensure that the account balances of the participants
in the Company 401(k) Plan are fully vested upon such plan termination, in
each case effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. Following the
Effective Time and as soon as practicable following receipt of a
favorable determination

 



50  letter from the IRS on the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, the
assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants, and Purchaser shall
take the action necessary (including the amendment of Purchasers 401(k) Plan
(the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ ")) to permit the Continuing Employees to roll
over any eligible rollover distributions (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code, including of loans) in cash or notes (in the case of
loans) in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such
Continuing Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan.
Each Continuing Employee shall be eligible immediately as of the Effective
Time to participate in the Purchaser 401(k) Plan.

(f) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.10, the provisions of
this Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no current or former employee, independent contractor or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Employee Benefit
Plan, Purchaser Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement maintained or sponsored by Purchaser, Company or any of their
respective affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan,
Purchaser Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date; or
(iii) confer upon any current or former employee, independent contractor or
other service provider any right to employment or continued employment or
continued service with Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries),
or constitute or create an employment or other agreement with any employee,
independent contractor or other service provider.

6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when
acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law; and Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall also
advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six years following
the Effective Time, Purchaser will provide directors and officers liability
insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and
directors of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as of
the Effective Time) (providing only for the Side A coverage for Indemnified
Parties where the existing policies also include Side B coverage for Company)
with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts
or events occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), which insurance will contain at least the
same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Party as that coverage currently provided by
Company; _provided_ that in no event shall Purchaser be required to expend, on
an annual basis, an amount in excess of 150% of the aggregate annual premiums
paid as of the date hereof by Company for any such insurance (the " _Premium
Cap_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that if any such annual expense at any time
would exceed the Premium Cap, then Purchaser will cause to be maintained
policies of insurance which provide the maximum coverage available at an
annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. Prior to the Effective Time and in
lieu of the foregoing, Company will use reasonable best efforts to purchase a
tail policy for directors and officers liability insurance on the terms
described in the prior sentence and otherwise subject to the specification set
forth on Exhibit 6.6(b) hereto and fully pay for such policy prior to the
Effective Time.

 



51 (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.6(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, will promptly notify Purchaser; provided that failure to so
notify will not affect the obligations of Purchaser under Section
6.6(a) unless and to the extent that Purchaser is actually and materially
prejudiced as a consequence.

(d) If Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or
merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its
assets to any other entity, then and in each case, Purchaser will cause
proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser
will assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

6.7 _Exemption from Liability Under Rule 16(b)-3_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Purchaser and Company shall each take all such steps as may be necessary
or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Company Common Stock or
conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of Company
Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

6.8 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
its Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents, advisors and affiliates not
to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or
provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any
discussions with, any person relating to, any Company Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
if at any time after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide Company
Acquisition Proposal and the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good
faith that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably
expected to result in, a Company Superior Proposal, then Company and its Board
of Directors may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic
information and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent
that the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith (and based on
the advice of counsel) that failure to take such actions would be more likely
than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable
law; _provided_ that prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to
be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso or engaging in any negotiations,
it shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party
on terms no less favorable to Company than the Confidentiality Agreement and
which expressly permits Company to comply with its obligations pursuant to
this Section 6.8. Subject to the foregoing and Section 6.8(c) below, Company
will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions
or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any persons
other than Purchaser with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal and
will use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law, to (i)
enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to a Company
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) within ten business days after the date hereof,
request and confirm the return or destruction of any confidential information
provided to any person (other than Purchaser and its affiliates) pursuant to
any such confidentiality or similar agreement. Company will promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours) advise Purchaser following receipt of any Company
Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or inquiry that
would reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Acquisition Proposal and
the substance thereof (including the identity of the person making such
Company Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Purchaser promptly apprised of
any related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms
and conditions of any such request, inquiry or Company Acquisition Proposal,
or all amendments or proposed amendments thereto) on a current basis (it being
understood that for the avoidance of doubt that no such communications to
Purchaser shall be deemed an Adverse Change of Recommendation). Company
agrees that it shall contemporaneously provide to Purchaser any confidential
or nonpublic information concerning Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
may be provided to any other person in connection with any Company Acquisition
Proposal which has not previously been provided to Purchaser.

 



52 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of Company may make an Adverse Change of Recommendation or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) if the Company receives a
Company Acquisition Proposal that is not withdrawn and the Board of Directors
of Company concludes in good faith that such Company Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; _provided_ that:

 

(i) the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith (and based on
the advice of counsel) that failure to take such actions would be more likely
than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable
law;

 

(ii) the Company provides Purchaser prior written notice at least three (3)
business days prior to taking such action, which notice shall state that the
Board of Directors of Company has received a Company Superior Proposal and,
absent any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Board
of Directors of Company has resolved to effect an Adverse Change of
Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d), as
applicable, which notice shall specify the basis for such Adverse Change of
Recommendation or termination, including the material terms of the Company
Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") (it being understood
for the avoidance of doubt that such Notice of Superior Proposal shall not be
deemed an Adverse Change of Recommendation);

 

(iii) during such three (3)-business day period, the Company negotiates in
good faith with Purchaser (to the extent that Purchaser wishes to negotiate)
to enable Purchaser to make an improved offer that is at least as favorable to
the shareholders of the Company so that such Company Acquisition Proposal
would cease to constitute a Company Superior Proposal; and

(iv) at the end of such three (3)-business day period (or such earlier time
that Purchaser advises the Company that it no longer wishes to negotiate to
amend this Agreement), the Board of Directors of Company, after taking into
account any modifications to the terms of this Agreement and the Merger agreed
to by Purchaser and Sub after receipt of such notice, continues to believe
that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Company or its Board
of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that such
Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant
to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement. As used in this
Agreement, " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " means a tender or exchange
offer, proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business combination
involving Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any proposal or
offer to acquire in any manner more than 24.9% of the voting power in, or
more than 24.9% of the fair market value of the business, assets or deposits
of, Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any sale of whole loans
and securitizations in the ordinary course and any bona fide internal
reorganization. As used in this Agreement, " _Company Superior Proposal_ "
means an unsolicited bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal that the
Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith to be more favorable
from a financial point of view to its shareholders than the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and to be reasonably capable of being
consummated on the terms proposed, (i) after receiving the advice of its
financial advisors (who shall be a nationally recognized investment banking
firm), (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such
transaction on the terms set forth therein and (iii) after taking into
account all legal (with the advice of counsel), financial (including the

Purchasers receipt of such notice, Purchaser may elect by written notice to

meanings indicated below:

the date hereof, any person shall have made a Company Acquisition Proposal,

withdrawn, and:

 

1) thereafter this Agreement is terminated:

 

(a) by either party pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii) ( _Delay_ ) without the
Company Shareholder Approval having been obtained and such failure to obtain
the Company Shareholder Approval is the only condition set forth in Article
VII that is unsatisfied, or Section 8.1(b)(iv) ( _No Company Shareholder
Approval_ ); or

 

(b) by Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) ( _Breach_ ) or Section
8.1(c) ( _No Company Recommendation_ ); and

2) within twelve months after such termination of this Agreement, a
Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated or any definitive
agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been

attributable to Purchaser or its regulatory status;

then Purchaser shall pay Company a fee, in immediately available funds, in the

Purchaser be obligated to pay Company the Purchaser Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

 

(d) _Liquidated Damages_. Company and Purchaser acknowledge that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, neither party would enter into this Agreement. The amounts payable
by Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b) or by Purchaser (provided Purchaser has
fully complied with its obligations hereunder, including with respect to
Sections 6.1 and 6.3 hereof) pursuant to Section 8.3(c) constitute liquidated
damages and not a penalty and shall be the sole monetary remedy of Purchaser
or Company, as applicable, in the event of termination of this Agreement under
such applicable section. In the event that either party fails to pay when due

performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written

or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.

or otherwise make any public statement, or, except as otherwise specifically
provided in this Agreement, any disclosure of nonpublic information to a
third party, concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) of Purchaser, in the case of a proposed announcement, statement or
disclosure by Company, or Company, in the case of a proposed announcement,
statement or disclosure by Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that either
party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after prior
consultation with the other party to the extent practicable under the
circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement to the extent required by law or by the rules and
regulations of the Nasdaq.

 

9.10 _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned by either of the parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any purported assignment in contravention
hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by

benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms
of this Agreement, and (2) this Agreement (including the documents and
instruments referred to in this Agreement) is not intended to and does not

under this Agreement, including the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein.

 

9.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage

are entitled at law or equity.

9.12 _Disclosure Schedule_.

 

(a) Before entry into this Agreement, Company delivered to Purchaser a
schedule (a " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") and Purchaser delivered to
Company a schedule a (" _Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_ "),

 



62  each of which sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which
is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained in Article III or Article IV,
respectively, or to one or more covenants contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
(i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a
representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect and (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item as an exception to a representation or warranty shall
not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Previously Disclosed_ " means
information set forth by Company or Purchaser in the applicable paragraph of
its Company Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, as
applicable, or any other paragraph of its Company Disclosure Schedule or
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, as applicable (so long as it is reasonably
clear from the context that the disclosure in such other paragraph of its
Company Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule is also
applicable to the section of this Agreement in question).
