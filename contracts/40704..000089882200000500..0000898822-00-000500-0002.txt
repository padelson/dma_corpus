transfer of immediately available funds to be held by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to a customary escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement"), in form
and substance mutually acceptable to General Mills, Diageo and Pillsbury
Stockholder. If mutually agreed by General Mills and Diageo, in lieu of
delivery to the Escrow Agent of $642 million in cash, Diageo may
cause Pillsbury Stockholder to deliver to the Escrow Agent $642 million of
investments mutually selected by General Mills and Pillsbury Stockholder. In
the event Pillsbury Stockholder delivers cash to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow
Agent shall invest such funds as mutually directed by General Mills and
Pillsbury Stockholder. The funds or investments delivered to the Escrow
Agent, together with any interest or other proceeds with respect thereto,
shall be the "Escrow Fund." The Escrow Fund shall be released upon   
-13-    the giving of a joint instruction (the "Joint Instruction") by
General Mills and Pillsbury Stockholder pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c)
below. All costs and expenses relating to the Escrow Agreement, including the
fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent, shall be borne equally by General
Mills and Pillsbury Stockholder.   (b) Unless the stockholders of General
Mills have approved a Disposition prior to the Anniversary Date, General
Mills and Pillsbury Stockholder shall (and Diageo shall cause Pillsbury
Stockholder to) give the Joint Instruction to the Escrow Agent on the
Anniversary Date, instructing the payout of the Escrow Fund as follows. The
Joint Instruction pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay to General Mills from the Escrow Fund, on or as promptly as
practicable following the Anniversary Date, an amount, if any, equal to the
total amount of the Escrow Fund less an amount, if any, equal to the product
of (i) the number of General Mills Shares Held multiplied by (ii) the
Contingent Share Value. The Joint Instruction pursuant to this paragraph (b)
shall further instruct the Escrow Agent to return to Pillsbury Stockholder
the remainder of the Escrow Fund, if any, promptly following payment of the
amount, if any, set forth above to General Mills.   (c) In the event the
stockholders of General Mills approve a Disposition prior to the Anniversary
Date, General Mills and Pillsbury Stockholder shall (and Diageo shall cause
Pillsbury Stockholder to) give the Joint Instruction to the Escrow Agent no
later than the date of the Disposition, instructing the payout of the Escrow
Fund as follows. The Joint Instruction pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to General Mills from the Escrow Fund, on or
as promptly as practicable following the date of the Disposition, an amount,
if any, equal to the total amount of the Escrow Fund less an amount, if any,
equal to the product of (i) the number of General Mills Shares Held
multiplied by (ii) the Disposition Value. The Joint Instruction pursuant to
this paragraph (c) shall further instruct the Escrow Agent to return to
Pillsbury Stockholder the remainder of the Escrow Fund, if any, promptly
following payment of the amount, if any, set forth above to General
Mills.   (d) The number of shares of General Mills Common Stock or type
of property or securities issuable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Subsidiary Purchase Agreements, the
Contingent Share Value, the Maximum Contingent Share Value, the Disposition
Value, the Target Price, the General Mills Shares Held and the calculation of
Market Value shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted to reflect (i) the
payment of any extraordinary distribution or dividend on shares of General
Mills Common Stock (other than regular quarterly cash dividends), (ii) any
stock split, stock dividend or combination of such shares or (iii) any
consolidation, merger or other event which results in the conversion or
exchange of such shares.   (e) All calculations and determinations pursuant
to this Section 2.13 shall be mutually agreed upon by Diageo and General
Mills in good faith, and shall be final and binding upon all of the parties
to this Agreement and on the Pillsbury Stockholder. General Mills and Diageo
agree to treat Pillsbury Stockholder as the owner of the Escrow Fund for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes until the Escrow Fund is disbursed pursuant to
the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement, except to the extent otherwise
required pursuant to a Determination.    -14-     Section 2.14.
Operating Working Capital Purchase Price Adjustment. (a) As soon as
practicable, but in no event later than 90 days following the Closing Date,
General Mills shall prepare a calculation of the Operating Working Capital of
the Business Entities as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Date
Operating Working Capital Calculation"). For this purpose "Operating Working
Capital" shall mean the Operating Working Capital of the Business Entities
determined as reflected in the line entitled "CR15297 Operating Working
Capital" on the balance sheet report (in management format) attached hereto
as Schedule 2.14. The Closing Date Operating Working Capital Calculation
shall be prepared in the same manner, consistent with past practice, and
based on the same items, as the Operating Working Capital of the Business
Entities has historically been prepared. Between the date hereof and the
Closing Date, the Business Entities shall, and Diageo shall cause the
Business Entities to, manage Operating Working Capital in the ordinary course
of business and consistent with past practice, and shall not take any action
for the purpose of changing the calculation of Operating Working Capital.  
(b) General Mills shall deliver a copy of the Closing Date Operating Working
Capital Calculation to Diageo promptly after it has been prepared.
After receipt of the Closing Date Operating Working Capital Calculation,
Diageo shall have 60 days to review the Closing Date Operating Working
Capital Calculation, together with the workpapers used in the preparation
thereof. Diageo and its authorized representatives shall have full access
during normal business hours to all relevant books and records and employees
of the Business Entities to the extent required to complete their review of
the Closing Date Operating Working Capital Calculation; provided, however,
that such access shall not unreasonably disrupt the personnel and operations
of the Business Entities. Unless Diageo delivers written notice to General
Mills on or prior to the 60th day after Diageo\'s receipt of the Closing Date
Operating Working Capital Calculation specifying in reasonable detail all
disputed items and the basis therefor, Diageo shall be deemed to have
accepted and agreed to the Closing Date Operating Working Capital
Calculation. If Diageo so notifies General Mills of its objection to the
Closing Date Operating Working Capital Calculation, General Mills and Diageo
shall, within 30 days following such notice (the "Resolution Period"),
attempt to resolve their differences and any resolution by them as to any
disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive.   (c) If at the
conclusion of the Resolution Period amounts shall remain in dispute, then all
amounts remaining in dispute shall be submitted to a firm of nationally
recognized independent public accountants (the "Neutral Auditors") selected
by Diageo and General Mills within 10 days after the expiration of
the Resolution Period. If Diageo and General Mills are unable to agree on
the Neutral Auditors, then Diageo and General Mills shall each have the right
to request the American Arbitration Association to appoint the Neutral
Auditors who shall not have had a material business relationship with Diageo,
General Mills or any of their respective Affiliates within the past two
years. The parties hereto agree to execute, if requested by the Neutral
Auditors, a reasonable engagement letter. All fees and expenses relating to
the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditors shall be borne
equally by Diageo and General Mills. The Neutral Auditors shall act as an
arbitrator to determine only those issues still in dispute. The Neutral
Auditors\' determination shall be made within 30 days of their selection,
shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to Diageo and General
Mills and shall be final, binding and conclusive. The term "Adjusted Closing
Date Operating Working Capital Calculation", as used herein, shall mean the
definitive Closing Date Operating Working Capital Calculation agreed or
deemed to have been agreed to by Diageo and General Mills in accordance with
Section 2.14(b)    -15-    or the definitive Closing Date Operating
Working Capital Calculation resulting from the determinations made by the
Neutral Auditors in accordance with this Section 2.14(c) (in addition to
those items theretofore agreed to by Diageo and General Mills).   (d) The
Purchase Price shall be reduced dollar for dollar by the amount, if any, by
which Operating Working Capital shown on the Adjusted Closing Date Operating
Working Capital Calculation is less than $100 million or increased dollar for
dollar by the amount, if any, by which Operating Working Capital shown on the
Adjusted Closing Date Operating Working Capital Calculation is greater than
$300 million, provided, however, that if the Closing Date is between October
15 and November 15, inclusive, the $300 million threshold shall be increased
to $400 million, and if the Closing Date is between March 15 and April 15,
inclusive, the $100 million threshold shall be reduced to zero; provided,
further, that if there is a sale, divestiture or disposition of any plants,
assets or businesses consummated prior to the Closing pursuant to Section
5.2, Diageo and General Mills shall mutually agree on an
appropriate adjustment of the aforementioned thresholds to reflect such sale,
divestiture or disposition. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the
Operating Working Capital shown on the Adjusted Closing Date Operating
Working Capital Calculation is not greater or less than the applicable
threshold, no adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made pursuant to this
Section 2.14.   (e) Any reduction in the Purchase Price made pursuant to
Section 2.14(d) shall be paid by Diageo, by wire transfer in immediately
available funds, to an account or accounts specified by General Mills, within
five Business Days after the Adjusted Closing Date Operating Working
Capital Calculation is agreed upon or deemed to have been agreed upon by
General Mills and Diageo or the written statement of the Neutral Auditors
setting forth their determination regarding any remaining disputed items is
delivered to General Mills and Diageo (such fifth Business Day, the
"Adjustment Payment Date"), and shall bear interest from (and including) the
Closing Date through (and including) the date of payment at the publicly
announced prime interest rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect from time to time
for unsecured short-term commercial loans. Any increase in the Purchase Price
made pursuant to Section 2.14(d) shall be paid by General Mills by delivery
to the Pillsbury Stockholder on the Adjustment Payment Date of a number of
shares of General Mills Common Stock equal to (i) the amount of the increase
(which shall bear interest from (and including) the Closing Date through (and
including) the date of payment at the publicly announced prime interest rate
of Citibank, N.A. in effect from time to time for unsecured short-term
commercial loans) divided by (ii) the Market Value on the Adjustment Payment
Date.   ARTICLE III   Representations and Warranties of Diageo and
Pillsbury  ------------------------------------------------------   Except
as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure
schedule delivered to General Mills by Diageo on or prior to the date hereof

Business Entity is duly organized and validly existing and, with respect to

properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and (ii) with respect to each U.S. Corporation, is in good standing
and is duly qualified to transact business in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of property owned or leased by it or the conduct of its business
requires it to be so qualified, except where the failure to be so organized
or in good standing or to be duly qualified to transact business, or to have
such power and authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of
operations of the Business Entities, taken as a whole (a "Pillsbury Material
Adverse Effect"). Diageo is a public limited company duly incorporated and
validly existing under the laws of England and Wales.   (b) Each of Diageo
and Pillsbury has the requisite corporate or similar power to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Diageo, the
Pillsbury Stockholder and the Selling Affiliates has the requisite corporate

perform its obligations thereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby. The execution and delivery by Diageo and Pillsbury of
this Agreement, the performance by Diageo and Pillsbury of their obligations
hereunder and the consummation by Diageo and Pillsbury of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the respective
Boards of Directors of Diageo and Pillsbury and, except for the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
and except for obtaining the approval of the shareholders of Diageo of the
disposition of the Business Entities contemplated hereby (the "Transactions")
by the Required Diageo Vote, no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Diageo or Pillsbury, their respective Boards of Directors or shareholders are
necessary therefor.   (c) The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements will not (i) violate any provision of
Diageo\'s, the Pillsbury Stockholder\'s, any Selling Affiliate\'s or any
Business Entity\'s respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or
equivalent organizational documents), (ii) violate any provision of, or be an
event that is (or with the passage of time will result in) a violation of, or
result in the acceleration of or entitle any party to accelerate or exercise
(whether after the giving of notice or lapse of time or both) any obligation
or right under, or result in the imposition of any Lien upon or the creation
of a security interest in any of the Purchased Interests, or any Business
Entity\'s assets or properties pursuant to, any Lien, agreement, instrument,
order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which Diageo, any Continuing
Affiliate or any Business Entity is a party or by which any of them is bound,
or (iii) violate or conflict with any other restriction of any kind or
character to which Diageo, any Continuing Affiliate or any Business Entity is
subject, that, in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii) would, individually or in
the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Pillsbury Material
Adverse Effect or prevent the Merger and the Subsidiary Purchases from
occurring prior to the Termination Date. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Diageo and Pillsbury, and, assuming the
due execution hereof by General Mills and Merger Sub, this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of Diageo and Pillsbury,
enforce-    -17-    able against Diageo and Pillsbury in accordance
with its terms, subject to the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, moratorium or other similar laws
relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally and to the effect
of the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether
considered in proceedings at law or in equity). At the Closing, each of the
Ancillary Agreements to which Diageo, the Pillsbury Stockholder or a Selling
Affiliate is or will be a party will be duly executed and delivered by
Diageo, the Pillsbury Stockholder and such Selling Affiliates, as applicable,
and, assuming the due execution and delivery thereof by the other parties
thereto, at the Closing will constitute the legal, valid and
binding obligations of Diageo, the Pillsbury Stockholder and such Selling
Affiliates, enforceable against Diageo, the Pillsbury Stockholder and such
Selling Affiliates in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, moratorium
or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors
generally and to the effect of the application of general principles of
equity (regardless of whether considered in proceedings at law or in equity).

personal property capitalized on or included in the Business   
-19-    Balance Sheet and each piece of real and personal property
acquired by any Business Entity since the date of the Business Balance Sheet
that would, had it been acquired prior to such date, be capitalized on or

Real Property to which any of the Business Entities is a party, of which all
material leases and subleases are identified in Section 3.5 of the Diageo
Disclosure Schedule, it being understood that for purposes of this sentence,
"material" shall mean any lease or sublease with total future payments in
excess of $5,000,000. There are no pending or, to Diageo\'s and
Pillsbury\'s knowledge, threatened condemnation proceedings relating to any
of the material Business Real Property. Except as disclosed in Section 3.5 of
the Diageo Disclosure Schedule, none of the material properties owned or
leased by any Business Entity or by Diageo or any of the Continuing
Affiliates is shared by any Business Entity, on the one hand, and the other
businesses, divisions or Subsidiaries of Diageo or any Continuing Affiliate,

in the Business Financial Statements, in the manner currently being
conducted. The Business Entities collectively own or lease, or otherwise have
good and valid rights to, all material assets, properties and other rights
related to the Business, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Pillsbury Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 3.6. Absence of Certain Changes. Since December

action taken by any Business Entity prior to the date hereof which, if taken
from the date hereof through the Closing, would violate any of the provisions
of subsections (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (xii)(A) and (xvii) of Section
5.4(a), provided that for the purposes of this clause (b), the reference in
Section 5.4(a)(v)(A) to "a commitment period of one year or less" shall be
deemed to be of no consequence for purposes of this Section 3.6 and the

actions, administrative or arbitration or other proceedings or
governmental investigations pending or, to Diageo\'s or Pillsbury\'s
knowledge, threatened against any Business Entity that would, individually or
in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Pillsbury Material
Adverse Effect or prevent the Merger and the Subsidiary Purchases from
occurring prior to the Termination Date. There are no judgments or
outstanding orders, injunctions, decrees, stipulations or awards (whether
rendered by a court or administrative agency, or by arbitration) against any
Business Entity or any of their respective properties or businesses that
would, individually or in the aggregate, have    -20-    or reasonably
be expected to have a Pillsbury Material Adverse Effect or prevent the Merger
and the Subsidiary Purchases from occurring prior to the
Termination Date.   Section 3.8. Intellectual Property. The Business
Entities own, or are validly licensed or otherwise have the right to use, all
Business Intellectual Property Rights used in the conduct of their
businesses, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a Pillsbury Material Adverse Effect. No
Business Intellectual Property Right is subject to any outstanding judgment,
injunction, order, decree or agreement restricting the use thereof by the
Business Entities or restricting the licensing thereof by the Business
Entities to any Person, except for any judgment, injunction, order, decree or
agreement which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a Pillsbury Material Adverse Effect. No
Business Entity is infringing on any other Person\'s Intellectual Property
Rights and to the knowledge of Diageo and Pillsbury no Person is infringing
on any Business Intellectual Property Rights, except, in either case, as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected
to have a Pillsbury Material Adverse Effect. Except for such matters as would
not have or reasonably be expected to have a Pillsbury Material
Adverse Effect: (i) no Business Entity is a defendant in any action, suit,

Business Entities have no outstanding claim or suit for any continuing
infringement by any other Person of any Business Intellectual Property
Rights. Section 3.8 of the Diageo Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of

permits, franchises and other authorizations of any Governmental Authority
("Licenses") possessed by or granted to any of the Business Entities are in
full force and effect, except for those whose failure to be in full force and
effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be
expected to have a Pillsbury Material Adverse Effect. No proceeding is
pending or, to Diageo\'s or Pillsbury\'s knowledge, threatened seeking the
revocation or limitation of any such License which revocation or limitation
would, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to
have a Pillsbury Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Section 3.9(b) of the Diageo
Disclosure Schedule contains a list of all registrations, filings,
applications, notices, consents, approvals, orders, qualifications and
waivers required to be made, filed, given or obtained by any of Diageo, the
Pillsbury Stockholder, any Seller Affiliate or any Business Entity with, to
or from any Persons or Governmental Authorities in connection with the
consummation of the Merger or the Subsidiary Purchases, except for those with
respect to which the failure to make, file, give or obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Pillsbury Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.10. Labor Matters. Section
3.10 of the Diageo Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all agreements
with labor unions or associations representing employees of any of the

expected to have a Pillsbury Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.11.
Compliance with Laws. The conduct of the business or businesses of each of
the Business Entities complies with all Laws applicable thereto, except for
those violations of Law which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have or reasonably be expected to have a Pillsbury Material Adverse Effect;
it being understood that nothing set forth in this Section 3.11 is intended
to address any compliance issue that is the subject of any
other representation or warranty set forth in Sections 3.9, 3.18, 3.19 or
3.21, or in Article VII.   Section 3.12. Insurance. Each of the Business
Entities is covered by valid and currently effective insurance policies
issued for the benefit of the Business Entities that are customary for
companies of similar size in the industry and locale in which the Business
Entities, as the case may be, operate.   Section 3.13. Material Contracts.
As of the date hereof, except as set forth in Section 3.13 of the Diageo

respect to all Business Material Contracts, (i) none of the Business
Entities, Diageo or any Continuing Affiliate, nor, to Diageo\'s or
Pillsbury\'s knowledge, any other party to any such Business Material
Contract is in breach thereof or default thereunder, and (ii) there does not
exist under any provision thereof, any event that, with the giving of notice
or the lapse of time or both, would constitute such a breach or default,
except for such breaches, defaults and events which in the case of clauses
(i) and (ii) would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably
be expected to have a Pillsbury Material Adverse Effect. Diageo and Pillsbury
have made available to General Mills true and correct copies of all Business

other authorizations which are required with respect to the operation of the
Business Entities as presently conducted under federal, state and local laws
and regulations relating to pollution or protection of the environment,
including laws relating to emissions, discharges, releases or threatened

Pollutants or Contaminants (as such terms are currently defined at 42 U.S.C.
ss. 7602 and in the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution
Contingency Plan, 40 C.F.R. ss. 300.5) into the environment (including,
without limitation, ambient air, surface water, ground water, land surface or
subsurface strata) or otherwise relating to the manufacture, processing,
distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling of Air
Pollutants, Hazardous Substances, Oils, Pollutants or Contaminants (the
"Environmental Laws"), except for the failure to have obtained such permits,
licenses and other authorizations as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Pillsbury
Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Each Business Entity as presently conducted
is in compliance with all terms and conditions of the permits, licenses and
authorizations required by the Environmental Laws, and is also in compliance
with all other applicable limitations, restrictions, conditions, standards,
prohibitions, requirements, obligations, schedules and timetables contained

not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have
a Pillsbury Material Adverse Effect. There is no civil, criminal or
administrative action, suit, demand, notice of violation, investigation known
to Diageo or Pillsbury, proceeding, notice or demand letter pending relating

Diageo and Pillsbury, threatened against the business or property of any
Business Entity under Environmental Laws or any code, plan, order, or decree,

Adverse Effect.   (c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,

activities, operations, or processes, on or beneath, the property of any
Business Entity, including, to the knowledge of Diageo and Pillsbury,
properties formerly owned by any Business Entity for which any Business
Entity has retained any material liability.   (d) Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Pillsbury Material Adverse Effect, no cleanup has occurred at any property
currently owned or operated by any Business Entity, which would result or
reasonably be expected to result in the assertion or creation of a material
Lien on such property by any Governmental Authority with respect thereto, nor
has any such assertion of a material Lien been made by any Governmental
Authority with respect thereto.   (e) Except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Pillsbury Material
Adverse Effect, none of the Business Entities has received any notice from
any Governmental Authority or private or public entity or individual
requesting information pursuant to Environmental Laws in connection with or
advising it that it is in non-compliance with applicable Environmental Laws,
or responsible for, or potentially responsible for, costs with respect to a

entered into any agreement for the clean-up of any Hazardous Substances,
Oils, Pollutants or Contaminants.   (f) Notwithstanding any other
representation and warranty in this Article III, the representations and
warranties contained in this Section 3.18 constitute the sole representations

thereto together with the most recent annual report (Form 5500 including, if
applicable, Schedule B thereto, summary plan description and any material
modifications thereto, annual financial report and actuarial valuation report
prepared in connection with any such Employee Plan and all trust agreements,
insurance contracts and other funding vehicles relating thereto. Section
3.19(a) of the Diageo Disclosure Schedule identifies each such Employee Plan
that is (i) a Multiemployer Plan, (ii) a Title IV Plan, (iii) maintained in
connection with any trust described in Section 501(c)(9) of the Code or (iv)
is funded through a welfare benefit fund within the meaning of Section 419 of
the Code.    -24-     (b) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust created under any
such Plan that is intended to be exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the
Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS. Diageo has
made available to General Mills the most recent determination letter of the
Internal Revenue Service relating to each such Employee Plan. Each Employee
Plan has been maintained in compliance with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by any and all applicable statutes, orders, rules and
regulations, including ERISA and the Code, except where the failure to be in
compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be
expected to have a Pillsbury Material Adverse Effect.   (c) Diageo has made
available to General Mills copies (or if there is no written plan document,
any existing written descriptions) of each material Benefit Arrangement (and,
if applicable, related trust agreements) and all amendments thereto. Each
such Benefit Arrangement has been maintained in substantial compliance with
its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all applicable
statutes, orders, rules and regulations and has been maintained in good
standing with applicable regulatory authorities, except where the failure to
be in compliance or to maintain good standing would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Pillsbury Material
Adverse Effect.   (d) Each International Plan has been maintained in
substantial compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by
any and all applicable statutes, orders, rules and regulations (including any
special provisions relating to qualified plans where such Plan was intended
so to qualify) and has been maintained in good standing with applicable
regulatory authorities, except where the failure to be in compliance or to
maintain good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a Pillsbury Material Adverse Effect. There has
been no amendment to, written interpretation of or announcement (whether or
not written) by Pillsbury or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change
in employee participation or coverage under, any International Plan that
would increase materially the expense of maintaining such International Plan
above the level of expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent
fiscal year ended prior to the date hereof. Each such International Plan that
is intended to be funded and/or book-reserved is fully funded and/or book-
reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.  
(e) Diageo\'s Disclosure Schedule contains a complete list of all material
Employee Plans and material Benefit Arrangements. Except as specifically
provided in the foregoing documents made available to General Mills, and
except as set forth in Section 5.4 of the Diageo Disclosure Schedule, no
amendments to any Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement have been adopted
or approved nor has any Business Entity undertaken to make any such
amendments or to adopt or approve any new Employee Plan or Benefit
Arrangement, except as would not materially increase the obligations of any
Business Entity under such amendment or new Employee Arrangement.   (f)
With respect to each Title IV Plan, except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Pillsbury Material
Adverse Effect: (i) there does not exist any accumulated funding deficiency
within the meaning of Code Section 412 or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or
not waived; (ii) no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of
ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has
oc-    -25-    curred, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not result in the occurrence of any such
reportable event; (iii) all premiums to the PBGC have been timely paid in
full; (iv) no material liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under
Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by any of the
Business Entities; (v) the actuarial present value of the accumulated plan
benefits under such Title IV Plan (whether or not vested) as of the close of
its most recent plan year did not exceed the fair market value of the assets
allocable thereto, and there are no facts or circumstances that would
materially change the funded status of any such Title IV Plan since the close
of such plan year; and (vi) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to
terminate any such Title IV Plan and, to Diageo\'s knowledge, no condition
exists that presents a risk that such proceedings will be instituted or which
would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of,
or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such Title IV Plan.  
(g) None of the Business Entities nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has incurred any material Withdrawal Liability that has not
been satisfied in full. With respect to each Employee Plan that is a
Multiemployer Plan and except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have or reasonably be expected to have a Pillsbury Material Adverse Effect:
(i) if any of the Business Entities or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates were to experience a withdrawal or partial withdrawal from such
plan, no material Withdrawal Liability would be incurred; and (ii) none of
the Business Entities, nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has
received any notification, nor does any of them have knowledge, that any such
Employee Plan is in reorganization, has been terminated, is insolvent, or may
reasonably be expected to be in reorganization, to be insolvent, or to be
terminated.   (h) Diageo\'s Disclosure Schedule sets forth: (i) each
Employee Arrangement under which the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could (either
alone or in conjunction with any other event such as termination of
employment) result in, cause the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of,
or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee,
officer or director of any Business Entity, or for which any Business Entity
could be liable in an amount which would be material, or would limit the
right of any of the Business Entities to amend, merge, terminate or receive a
reversion of assets from any Employee Arrangement or related trust; and (ii)
estimates of the aggregate dollar amounts payable by the Business Entities
pursuant to or with respect to bonuses and other incentive compensation in
connection with or as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.   (i) There are no pending or, to Pillsbury\'s
knowledge, threatened claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary
course), investigations, lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted or
instituted against the Employee Arrangements, any fiduciaries thereof with
respect to their duties to such Employee Arrangements or the assets of any of
the trusts under any of such Employee Arrangements which would reasonably be
expected to result in any liability of any Business Entity to the PBGC, the
Department of Treasury, the Department of Labor, or any other U.S. or foreign
governmental authority, or to any of such Employee Arrangements, any
participant in any such Employee Arrangement, or any other party, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected
to have a Pillsbury Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, none of the Business Entities has any actual or contingent
liability under any such Employee Arrangement or under    -26-    any
applicable law or regulation for pay or benefits incurred as a result
of corporate restructuring, downsizing, layoffs or similar events that has
not been fully satisfied or adequately reserved for in the audited
consolidated financial statements (including the related notes) and unaudited
consolidated financial statements (including the related notes) of the
Business Entities, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have or reasonably be expected to have a Pillsbury Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 3.20. Acquisition of Shares for Investment. Diageo,
the Pillsbury Stockholder and the Selling Affiliates have such knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters that they are capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of their acquisition of the Purchase Price
Shares and the Additional Shares, if any, and have been provided access to
personnel and books of General Mills and its Subsidiaries for purposes of
making their evaluation. Diageo, the Pillsbury Stockholder and the Selling
Affiliates are acquiring the Purchase Price Shares and the Additional Shares,
if any, for investment and not with a view toward any distribution thereof,
or with any present intention of distributing such shares. Diageo, the
Pillsbury Stockholder and the Selling Affiliates agree that the Purchase
Price Shares and the Additional Shares, if any, may not be sold, transferred,
offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without
registration under the Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption from
such registration available under the Securities Act.   Section 3.21.

on the business, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) or
results of operations of General Mills and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(a "General Mills Material Adverse Effect").   (b) General Mills and Merger
Sub have the requisite corporate power to execute and deliver this Agreement

Subsidiaries\' respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or
equivalent organizational documents instruments), (ii) violate any provision
of, or be an event that is (or with the passage of time will result in) a
violation of, or result in the acceleration of or entitle any party to

Lien upon or the creation of a security interest in any shares of capital
stock of General Mills or its Subsidiaries or any of General Mills\' or any

General Mills Material Adverse Effect or prevent the Merger and the
Subsidiary Purchases from occurring prior to the Termination Date. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by General Mills and Merger
Sub, and, assuming the due execution hereof by Diageo and Pillsbury, this

General Mills.   (c) All of the Pillsbury Purchase Price Shares, when issued
in the Merger pursuant to this Agreement, all of the Subsidiary Purchase

General Mills has filed all forms, reports and documents (including all
Exhibits, Schedules and Annexes thereto) required to be filed by it with the
SEC since January 1, 1999, including any amendments or supplements thereto
(collectively, the "General Mills SEC Reports"). As of their respective
dates, none of the General Mills SEC Reports (and, if amended or superseded
by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, then on
the date of such filing) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.   (b) The financial statements,
including all related notes and schedules, contained in the General Mills SEC
Reports (or incorporated therein by reference) (the "General Mills Financial
Statements") fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position and results of operations and cash flows of General Mills
and its Subsidiaries for the respective periods or as of the respective dates
set forth therein, in each case in accordance with U.S. GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as otherwise

and except for liabilities which are reflected or reserved against in the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of General Mills and its Subsidiaries as

Mills Balance Sheet"), none of General Mills and its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations that would be required to be reflected on a
consolidated balance sheet of General Mills and its Subsidiaries or in the
footnotes thereto prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, except for
liabilities or obligations arising in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since February 27, 2000, which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
General Mills Material Adverse Effect.   Section 4.5. Properties. With the
exception of properties disposed of since the date of the General Mills
Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business and except as set forth in
the General Mills SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, General Mills

or license, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, each
piece of real and personal property capitalized on or included in   
-30-    the General Mills Balance Sheet and each piece of real and
personal property acquired by General Mills or any of its Subsidiaries since
the date of the General Mills Balance Sheet that would, had it been acquired
prior to such date, be capitalized on or included in the General Mills
Balance Sheet, except where the failure to have such title or hold such lease
or license would not have or reasonably be expected to have a General Mills
Material Adverse Effect.   Section 4.6. Absence of Certain Changes. Except
in connection with this Agreement or the Subsidiary Purchase Agreements or as
set forth in the General Mills SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof,
since the date of the General Mills Balance Sheet, there has been no (a)
change or development in, or effect which has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, a General Mills Material Adverse Effect or (b) action taken
by General Mills or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof which,
if taken from the date hereof through the Closing, would violate any of the
provisions of subsections (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section
5.4(b).   Section 4.7. Litigation; Orders. Except as set forth in the
General Mills SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, there are no
lawsuits, actions, administrative or arbitration or other proceedings or
governmental investigations pending or, to General Mills\' knowledge,
threatened against General Mills or any of its Subsidiaries that would,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
General Mills Material Adverse Effect or prevent the Merger and the
Subsidiary Purchases from occurring prior to the Termination Date. There are
no judgments or outstanding orders, injunctions, decrees, stipulations or
awards (whether rendered by a court or administrative agency, or by
arbitration) against General Mills or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or businesses that would, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a General Mills Material
Adverse Effect or prevent the Merger and the Subsidiary Purchases from
occurring prior to the Termination Date.   Section 4.8. Intellectual
Property. General Mills and its Subsidiaries own, or are validly licensed or
otherwise have the right to use, all General Mills Intellectual Property
Rights used in the conduct of their businesses, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
General Mills Material Adverse Effect. No General Mills Intellectual Property
Right is subject to any outstanding judgment, injunction, order, decree or
agreement restricting the use thereof by General Mills or any of its
Subsidiaries or restricting the licensing thereof by General Mills and its
Subsidiaries to any Person, except for any judgment, injunction,
order, decree or agreement which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have or reasonably be expected to have a General Mills Material Adverse
Effect. Neither General Mills nor any of its Subsidiaries is infringing on
any other Person\'s Intellectual Property Rights and to the knowledge of
General Mills no Person is infringing on any General Mills Intellectual
Property Rights, except, in either case, as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a General Mills Material
Adverse Effect. Except for such matters as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a General Mills Material
Adverse Effect (i) neither General Mills nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
defendant in any action, suit, investigation or proceeding relating to, or
otherwise was notified of, any alleged claim of infringement of any
Intellectual Property Right and (ii) General Mills and its Subsidiaries have
no outstanding claim or suit for any continuing infringement by any other
Person of any General Mills Intellectual Property Rights.    -31-

etc. (a) Except as set forth in the General Mills SEC Reports filed prior to
the date of this Agreement, all Licenses of General Mills and
its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect except for those whose failure
to be in full force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have or reasonably be expected to have a General Mills Material Adverse
Effect. No proceeding is pending or, to General Mills\' knowledge, threatened
seeking the revocation or limitation of any such License which revocation or
limitation would, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be
expected to have a General Mills Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Section
4.9(b) of the General Mills Disclosure Schedule contains a list of all
registrations, filings, applications, notices, consents, approvals, orders,
qualifications and waivers required to be made, filed, given or obtained by
General Mills or any of its Subsidiaries with, to or from any Persons
or Governmental Authorities in connection with the consummation of the Merger
or the Subsidiary Purchases, except for those with respect to which the
failure to make, file, give or obtain would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a General Mills Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 4.10. Labor Matters. Neither General Mills nor any
of its Subsidiaries is involved in or, to General Mills\' knowledge,
threatened with any work stoppage, labor dispute, arbitration, lawsuit or
administrative proceeding relating to labor matters involving the employees

SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, the conduct of the businesses of
General Mills and its Subsidiaries complies with all Laws applicable
thereto, except for those violations of Law which would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a General Mills
Material Adverse Effect; it being understood that nothing set forth in this
Section 4.11 is intended to address any compliance issue that is the subject
of any other representation or warranty set forth in Section 4.9 or in
Article VII.   Section 4.12. Insurance. General Mills and its Subsidiaries
are covered by valid and currently effective insurance policies issued in
favor of General Mills and its Subsidiaries that are customary for companies
of similar size in the industry and locale in which General Mills and its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, operate.   Section 4.13. Material
Contracts. As of the date hereof, except as set forth in the General Mills
SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof or as set forth on Section 4.13 of
the General Mills Disclosure Schedule (such exceptions, the "General Mills
Material Contracts"), neither General Mills nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or bound by any (a) "material contract" (as such term is defined in

that materially limits or purports to materially limit the ability of any of
General Mills or any of its Affiliates to compete in any line of business or
in any geographic area. With respect to all General Mills Material
Contracts, (i) neither General Mills nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to
General Mills\' knowledge, any other party to any such General Mills Material
Contract is in breach thereof or default thereunder, and (ii) there does not
exist under any provision    -32-    thereof, any event that, with the

reasonably be expected to have a General Mills Material Adverse Effect.

of each of the General Mills Financial Advisors, each dated the date of this
Agreement, to the effect that the consideration to be paid by General Mills
and the Buying Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement and the Subsidiary

each of which opinions contains the consent of the applicable General Mills

document delivered to the stockholders of General Mills in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 4.16. Board

or delivery of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.   Section 4.17.
Required Vote. The affirmative vote of (a) a majority of the votes cast by
the holders of the outstanding shares of General Mills Common Stock, provided

Pillsbury and Diageo shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
afford to General Mills and General Mills\' accountants, counsel and other

records and to employees of the Business Entities and, to the extent related
to the Business, Diageo and its other Subsidiaries, and their agents and

of the Business Entities with respect to plant visits, in order that General
Mills may make reasonable investigations of the affairs of the Business and
the Business Entities.   (b) From the date hereof through the Closing,
General Mills shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to Diageo

representatives reasonable access during regular business hours, upon
reasonable advance notice, to any books and records retained by Diageo or the

Entities (but that do not relate primarily to the operations of the Business

General Mills and its Subsidiaries), but such access need be given only with
respect to the portion of such books and records as are related to the
operations of the Business Entities. Upon General Mills\' request, Diageo
shall, and shall cause the Continuing Affiliates to, provide General Mills

any decree, order, injunction, judgment, decision or determination or the
initiation of any lawsuit, action or proceeding by any Governmental Authority
seeking to, in whole or in part, enjoin, prevent or delay the consummation of
the Merger, the Subsidiary Purchases or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, or (y) effect the dissolution or
termination of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other decree,
order, judgment, decision or determination in any suit, action, inquiry,
investigation or proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect of
preventing or delaying, in whole or in part, the consummation of the Merger,
the Subsidiary Purchases or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements; provided, however, that General Mills
shall not be required to offer, take or agree to any actions in connection
with, or agree to, any hold separate order, sale, divestiture or disposition

$650 million in revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999; and
provided further that neither Pillsbury nor Diageo shall, nor shall they
cause any of their Subsidiaries to, divest or dispose of any plants, assets

shall keep the other parties reasonably apprised of the status of matters
relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including

shall cooperate in obtaining the opinion of Diageo\'s tax counsel to satisfy
the condition set forth in Section 8.3(d).   (e) Without limiting the
generality of the undertakings provided in this Section 5.2, the parties

relevant Governmental Antitrust Authority giving effect thereto) if such
action should be reasonably necessary or advisable to avoid the initiation of
any action or proceeding, or the entry or issuance of any decree, order,
injunction, judgment, decision, determination or other action, by
any Governmental Antitrust Authority to delay, restrain, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit, in whole or in part, consummation of the Merger, the

permanent or preliminary injunction or other decree, order, judgment,

foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any lawsuit, investigation, inquiry,
action or proceeding that would make consummation, in whole or in part, of

this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements unlawful or that would prevent or
delay, in whole or in part, consummation of the Merger, the Subsidiary
Purchases or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, any and all steps (including the taking of any appeal,
the posting of any bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clause
(ii) of this paragraph) necessary to vacate, modify or   
-36-    suspend such injunction, decree, order, judgment, decision or
determination so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as
possible to that contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements;
provided, however, that the obligations of this Section 5.2 may be modified
or amended by written agreement signed by the respective duly authorized
representatives of the parties hereto. The parties agree that none of the
steps or actions required to be taken pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be
considered a Pillsbury Material Adverse Effect or General Mills Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 5.3. Further Assurances. The parties hereto agree
that, from time to time, whether before, at or after the Closing Date, each
of them will execute and deliver such further instruments of conveyance and
transfer and take such other actions as may be necessary to carry out the
purposes and intents of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the parties hereto agree that:   (a) Between the date hereof
and the Closing, they will use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the Business Entities hold all of the assets and liabilities of the Business
and no other assets or liabilities.   (b) Following the Closing, to the
extent any assets or rights of the Business have been retained by Diageo and
the Continuing Affiliates, Diageo shall and shall cause the Continuing
Affiliates to use their respective reasonable best efforts to convey such
assets or rights to the Business Entities as promptly as practicable (and
pending such conveyance to provide the Business Entities with the benefit of
such assets).   (c) To the extent any real property or other assets or
facilities, or any rights or services, are shared or used jointly by the
Business, on the one hand, and the businesses of Diageo and its Subsidiaries
other than the Business, on the other hand, the parties will use their
reasonable best efforts to reach equitable arrangements under which such real
property, assets, facilities, rights and services will cease to be shared at
or prior to the Closing. To the extent this is not possible, the parties will
mutually agree in good faith on reasonable transition arrangements that will
allow such sharing to cease as soon as practicable following the Closing
(except to the extent the parties agree on longer term sharing arrangements,
which shall be agreed on an arm\'s-length basis).   Section 5.4. Conduct of

reasonable notice and opportunity to consult with Diageo in advance of
consummation) incident to the Subsidiary Purchases, which transactions are
not detrimental to General Mills or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or
to any of the Business Entities, or (iii) as required by applicable Law), or
as otherwise agreed to in writing by General Mills, the Business of the
Business Entities shall be conducted in the ordinary and usual course and, to
the extent consistent therewith (and subject to the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.4(a)), the Business Entities will use all reasonable best
efforts to preserve and maintain existing relations and goodwill
with employees, customers, brokers, suppliers and other Persons with which
the Business Entities as a    -37-    group have significant business
relations. Without limiting the foregoing, Pillsbury agrees, as to itself and
its Subsidiaries, and Diageo agrees, as to each of the Business Entities,

transactions (as to which Diageo has provided General Mills reasonable notice
and opportunity to consult with Diageo in advance of consummation) incident
to the Subsidiary Purchases, which transactions are not detrimental to
General Mills or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or to any of the
Business Entities or (iii) as required by applicable Law), or as otherwise
agreed to in writing by General Mills, Pillsbury shall not and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, and Diageo shall cause each of the Business Entities
not to, directly or indirectly do, or commit to do, any of the following:

Mills and their respective Subsidiaries required to comply in all material

Mills\' Board of Directors will take such action as may be necessary to elect

Walsh or Mr. Keenan shall at the Effective Time be unable or unwilling to

by Diageo and General Mills from amongst a pool of the Diageo Directors,
provided that Diageo and General Mills shall be entitled, should they agree,
to select an individual not from amongst such pool).   Section 5.13. Stock

Effective Time, Diageo and General Mills shall agree in good faith on, and
cooperate to implement, a plan for the incurrence (and prepayment) by
Pillsbury of new third-party indebtedness in an amount equal to (i) $5.142
billion less (ii) the amount of aggregate outstanding indebtedness of the
Business Entities as of the Closing Date (other than intercompany
indebtedness owing to Diageo or one or more Continuing Affiliates, all of
which intercompany indebtedness will be repaid and/or contributed to capital
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 5.15 and Section 5.6(a)). Pillsbury
shall not enter into any new debt facilities or otherwise incur any
indebtedness pursuant to this Section 5.15(a) without General Mills\' consent
to the amount and terms thereof, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld.   (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Pillsbury will pay
to Pillsbury Stockholder and/or another Continuing Affiliate all of the
proceeds of the new third-party indebtedness incurred pursuant to paragraph
(a) of this Section 5.15, either as a dividend or as a repayment of
intercompany loans or payables, or a combination of dividend and repayment.
Any intercompany loans or payables not repaid pursuant to this paragraph (b)
will be contributed to capital at the Effective Time as contemplated by
Section 5.6(a).   Section 5.16. Insurance. (a) From the date hereof to the
Effective Time, Diageo and General Mills will cooperate reasonably to develop
and implement a transition plan with re-    -46-    spect to insurance
coverage for the Business Entities, with the goal of ensuring continuing
insurance coverage and transfer at the Effective Time of the responsibility
for risk management relating to the Business Entities from Diageo to General
Mills (subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 5.16).   (b) From
and after the Effective Time, Diageo shall use its reasonable efforts,
subject to the terms of the Diageo Insurance Policies, to retain the right to
make claims and receive recoveries, subject to Section 5.16(f), for the
benefit of the Business Entities, as well as for the benefit of Diageo and
the Continuing Affiliates, under any insurance policies maintained at any
time prior to the Closing by Diageo or a Continuing Affiliate or
the predecessors of any of them that provide coverage on an "occurrence"
rather than a "claims made" basis (collectively, the "Diageo Insurance
Policies"), covering any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense relating
to the assets, business, operations, conduct, products and employees
(including former employees) of any of the Business Entities and their
respective predecessors (in each case, in so far as they cover or otherwise
relate to the Business or otherwise relate to losses, liabilities, claims,
damages or expenses as to which any of the Business Entities could have
responsibility) that relates to or arises out of occurrences prior to or at
the Closing (an "Insurance Claim").   (c) General Mills or the applicable
Business Entity will pay, incur and bear all amounts relating to any self-
retention or deductible and any gaps in or limits on coverage applicable to
an Insurance Claim asserted at any time with respect to the applicable Diageo
Insurance Policy and the coverage available with respect to any Insurance
Claim shall be the actual coverage available under such Dover Insurance
Policy at the time the Insurance Claim is made, taking into account the
effect of any prior claim payments on any self-retention or deductible or in
causing any gap or limits on coverage under the terms of such Diageo
Insurance Policy, whether or not the applicable Diageo Insurance Policy
solely covers claims of the Business Entities or covers claims of both Diageo
and the Continuing Affiliates on the one hand, and the Business Entities on
the other hand. In the event that any legal action, arbitration, negotiation
or other proceedings are required for coverage to be asserted against any
insurer in connection with the Diageo Insurance Policies or for an Insurance
Claim to be perfected, in each case on behalf of any of the
Business Entities, (i) General Mills shall, to the extent possible, do so at
its own expense or at the expense of the applicable Business Entity or (ii)
if General Mills is not permitted to assert coverage or perfect an Insurance
Claim, Diageo or one of the Continuing Affiliates shall do so, and, in either
event, General Mills or the applicable Business Entity shall reimburse Diageo
and the Continuing Affiliates for any reasonable costs and expenses that they
may incur because of such action (other than the incurrence of normal
internal administrative expenses).   (d) Each of Diageo, General Mills and
the Business Entities shall use its reasonable best efforts (i) to cooperate
fully and to cause its Affiliates to cooperate fully with the others in
submitting good faith Insurance Claims on behalf of the Business Entities
under the Diageo Insurance Policies and (ii) to pay promptly over to General
Mills (or, at General Mills\' request, to the applicable Business Entities)
any and all amounts received by Diageo or the Continuing Affiliates under the
Diageo Insurance Policies with respect to Insurance Claims.   (e) Diageo
and the Continuing Affiliates shall retain custody of the Diageo Insurance
Policies and any and all service contracts, claim settlements and all other
insurance records relating thereto; and General Mills and the Business
Entities shall have access to and the    -47-    right to make copies
of all such documents and records upon reasonable request to Diageo or the
Continuing Affiliates.   (f) Nothing contained herein to the contrary shall
prohibit Diageo from managing its risk management program with respect to
post-Closing periods, including without limitation the cancellation or
reduction of the amount or scope of insurance coverage with respect to post-
Closing periods, in a manner consistent with their business judgment as
applied to the operations of Diageo and the Continuing Affiliates. Nothing
contained in this Section 5.16 shall affect the indemnification rights or
obligations of the parties pursuant to this Agreement.    ARTICLE VI

the Closing, General Mills shall continue to provide all current U.S.
employees of the Business Entities employed as of the Closing Date who
continue to be employed following the Closing Date (the "Employees") with
base compensation no less than the base compensation in effect for such
Employee immediately prior to the Closing. The term "Employees" shall not
include any employees or former employees of the Business Entities who prior
to the Closing Date have retired, or have otherwise terminated employment.
For one year following the Closing, General Mills shall maintain employee
benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements which provide benefits
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided under the

Business Entities in effect on the Closing Date or, at the election
of General Mills, shall be provided employee benefit plans, programs,
policies and arrangements which provide benefits that are no less favorable
in the aggregate than those provided to similarly situated employees of
General Mills and its Affiliates; provided, however, that the requirements of
this paragraph shall not apply to Employees who are covered by a collective
bargaining agreement.   (b) Severance and Retention. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) for a period of one year from the Closing Date, General Mills
will provide or will cause to be provided severance pay and benefits to
eligible Employees (other than Employees covered by a collective bargaining
agreement) that are at least equal to those that would have been provided to
such Employee by the Minneapolis Salaried Employees Severance Plan or the
Executive Severance Plan, as amended, whichever is applicable, (ii) for a
period of one year following the Closing Date, General Mills shall make
reasonable efforts, which shall not require increases in payments or
benefits, to include Diageo under any release of liability obtained from
terminated Employees, (iii) General Mills shall maintain the July 2000
Completion and Performance Plan provided to General Mills prior to the date
hereof implemented by Pillsbury prior to the Closing (for the position levels
set forth in such plan), without amendment or modification that would result
in any reduction of the benefits provided thereunder, and (iv) General Mills
shall pay each retention bonus arising from the Pillsbury March,
2000 reorganization, pursuant to the terms of such retention program, upon
the earlier of its payment date or the participating Employee\'s termination
of    -48-    employment by General Mills (other than a termination of
employment for Cause); provided, that any payment under (iii) or (iv) above,
shall be an offset to a later payment under (iii) or (iv), as applicable.
Nothing in this Agreement shall require General Mills or its Affiliates to
maintain the employment of any Employee.   (c) Collective Bargaining
Agreements. General Mills agrees to cause each Business Entity from and after
the Closing to comply with the provisions of all collective bargaining
agreements to which such Business Entity is a party. Between the date hereof
and the Closing Date, Pillsbury shall consult with General Mills with respect
to extension, modification, renewal or renegotiation of any collective
bargaining agreement.   (d) Service Credit. To the extent permitted by law,
Employees shall be given credit under each employee benefit plan,
compensation program, policy or arrangement (including, but not limited to,
pension, severance, vacation, health and welfare, incentive bonus and equity-
based plans) of General Mills or any of its Affiliates in which the Employees
are eligible to participate for all service with any Business Entity or its
Affiliates (to the extent such credit was given by the Business Entity\'s
applicable employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement) for
purposes of participation, eligibility and vesting, and for benefit accrual
for liabilities assumed under Section 6.1(l). The provisions in this
paragraph (d) shall not be required with respect to Employees who are covered
by a collective bargaining agreement.   (e) Employee Benefit Transition.
General Mills shall waive pre-existing condition requirements, evidence of
insurability provisions, waiting period requirements or any similar
provisions for any Employees under any medical, dental, disability or life
insurance plan maintained or sponsored by or contributed to by General Mills
for such individuals after the Closing Date, other than pre-existing
conditions and evidence of insurability that would have been applicable under
the Employee Arrangements. General Mills shall also apply towards any
deductible requirements and out-of-pocket maximum limits under such plans any
amounts paid (or accrued) by each Employee under the Business Entity\'s
comparable benefit plans during the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs. The provisions in this paragraph (e) shall not be required
with respect to Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining
agreement   (f) Vacation. As of the Closing Date, General Mills will assume
all obligations to Employees for any vacation entitlement and vacation
pay entitlement as of the Closing Date to the extent reflected on the Closing
Date Operating Working Capital Calculation.   (g) COBRA. General Mills will
be responsible for satisfying obligations under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA
and Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA coverage") and any applicable similar
state laws, to provide continuation coverage to or with respect to any
Employee in accordance with law with respect to any "qualifying event,"
provided, that Diageo shall remain responsible for COBRA coverage with
respect to any employee of a Business Entity who had a qualifying event prior
to Closing under a welfare plan not sponsored by a Business Entity.   (h)
No Third-Party Beneficiary Rights. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, shall create a third-party beneficiary relationship or otherwise
confer any benefit, entitlement, or right upon any person or entity other
than the parties hereto, including any right to employment or
continued employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind
whatso-    -49-    ever. Nothing in this Agreement shall cause
duplicate benefits to be paid or provided to or with respect to any employee
under any employee benefit policies, plans, arrangements, programs,
practices, or agreements.   (i) Plans Not Sponsored by Business Entities.
Except as provided in Section 6.1(l), Diageo (and its Affiliates other than
the Business Entities) shall be responsible for all benefits and liabilities
under any Employee Arrangement that is not sponsored by a Business Entity
(each, a "Diageo Plan"). Diageo shall take all actions necessary and
appropriate to ensure that as of the Closing Date, except as provided in
Section 6.1(j) below, all Employees shall cease to accrue benefits under
Diageo Plans and the Business Entities shall withdraw from participation in
any Diageo Plans. Except as provided in Section 6.1(j) below, Diageo shall
vest, as of the Closing Date, all equity awards held by employees of the
Business Entities, and shall be responsible for honoring such equity
awards.   (j) TSR Plan. Until such time as all such payments or benefits
have been provided, Diageo shall maintain the Diageo Long Term Incentive
Plan, also known as the Total Shareholder Return Plan (and shall provide or
cause to be provided in a timely manner all payments due with respect to 1998
and 1999 grants made thereunder) for Employees who provide services to
Pillsbury and its Affiliates following the Closing (as if they were
continuing to provide services for Diageo and its Affiliates (other than the
Business Entities)) and who participated in such plans immediately prior to
the Closing upon the terms provided in such plans, which terms shall be no
less favorable than those applicable to other employees of Diageo or its
Affiliates. General Mills and the Business Entities shall not be responsible
for any payments or benefits under the Total Shareholder Return Plan.   (k)
Controlled Group Liability. Diageo shall indemnify and hold General Mills and
the Business Entities harmless from any and all Controlled Group Liability
(the occurrence of which is unrelated to the Business Entities).   (l) Asset
Transfers. At the election of General Mills, on a plan-by-plan basis, to the
extent permitted by local law, General Mills will assume responsibility for
pension liabilities for active participants employed by the Business Entities
as of the Closing Date (subject to appropriate adjustment to reflect payments
made following the Closing Date) under pension plans and arrangements that
are Diageo Plans and Diageo will transfer or cause its applicable pension
fund to transfer to General Mills\' pension fund corresponding assets to
cover such liabilities on a projected obligation basis based upon specified
actuarial methods and assumptions mutually agreed upon by actuaries for
Diageo and General Mills in accordance with local Law and practice; provided,
that such transfer shall not be required for any unfunded plan, to the extent
such liabilities were reflected on the Closing Date Operating Working Capital
Calculation. If such actuaries cannot agree, such methods and assumptions
shall be reasonable both individually and in the aggregate as determined by a
mutually agreed upon third party actuary whose expenses shall be split by the
parties. Where required, the parties hereto will use reasonable efforts to
obtain any necessary consents to such transfer of assets and liabilities.
Such transfers shall occur as soon as practicable following the Closing Date.
To the extent permitted by Law and the terms of such contracts, Diageo shall
transfer to General Mills or the relevant Business Entity the assets and
insurance contracts, if any, used to fund liabilities under health, life and
accident insurance plans sponsored by the Business Entities.   
-50-     (m) International Plan Disclosure. With respect to
material International Plans, Diageo shall deliver to General Mills within 45
days following the date hereof, a list of each such plan, and a copy of the
relevant plan document and trust agreement, the latest financial report and
actuarial report, and insurance contracts and other funding vehicles, if
applicable.    ARTICLE VII   Tax Matters  -----------   Section 7.1.
Tax Representations of Diageo. Each of Diageo and Pillsbury hereby represents
and warrants to General Mills and Merger Sub as follows:   (a) The Business
Entities have duly filed or caused to be filed (or had filed on their behalf)
all material federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns (including, but
not limited to, those filed on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis)
required to have been filed by (or on behalf of) any of them. All of the
foregoing Tax Returns are true and correct in all material respects, and the
Business Entities have, within the time and manner prescribed by applicable
law, paid all material Taxes required to be paid in respect of the periods
covered by such Tax Returns or otherwise due to any Taxing Authority other
than any Taxes the validity of which is being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which adequate reserves
in accordance with U. S. GAAP have been provided. Except as set forth in
Section 7.1(a) of the Diageo Disclosure Schedule, none of the Business
Entities has requested or filed any document having the effect of causing any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Returns in respect of
any fiscal year which have not since been filed. Except as set forth in
Section 7.1(a) of the Diageo Disclosure Schedule, no deficiencies for any
material Tax have been proposed, asserted or assessed in writing, in each
case, by any Taxing Authority, against any of the Business Entities. Except
as set forth in Section 7.1(a) of the Diageo Disclosure Schedule, none of the
Business Entities is the subject of any currently ongoing material Tax audit.
Except as set forth in Section 7.1(a) of the Diageo Disclosure Schedule,
there are no pending requests for waivers of the time to assess any material
Tax, other than those made in the ordinary course and for which payment has
been made. Except as set forth in Section 7.1(a) of the Diageo Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Business Entities has waived any statute of limitations
in respect of material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect
to a material Tax assessment or deficiency. There are no material liens with
respect to Taxes upon any of the properties or assets, real or personal,
tangible or intangible of any of the Business Entities (other than liens for
Taxes not yet due). No material claim has ever been made in writing by a
Taxing Authority in a jurisdiction where a Business Entity does not file Tax
Returns that such Business Entity is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction. None of the Business Entities has filed an election
under Section 341(f) of the Code to be treated as a "consenting corporation"
within the meaning of such Code Section.   (b) The Business Entities have
withheld and paid or have caused to be withheld and paid all material Taxes
required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or
owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other
third party.    -51-      (c) None of the Business Entities has
constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation"
within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code in a distribution of
stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the
Code (i) in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement (or will
constitute such a corporation in the two years prior to the Closing Date) or
(ii) in a distribution which otherwise constitutes part of a "plan" or
"series of related transactions" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the
Code in conjunction with the Merger.   Section 7.2. General Mills
Reorganization-Related Representations. Each of General Mills and Merger Sub
hereby represents and warrants to Diageo and Pillsbury as follows:   (a)
Following the Merger, General Mills, or a member of its qualified group of
corporations (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)),
will continue the historic business of Pillsbury or will use a significant
portion of Pillsbury\'s historic business assets in a business. For purposes
of this representation, General Mills and such members (i) shall be deemed to
own that portion of the assets of a partnership reflecting their interest
therein and (ii) shall be treated as conducting the business of a partnership
of which they are members, provided that (x) they own in the aggregate at
least a 33 1/3% interest in the partnership or (y) they own in the aggregate
at least a 20% interest in such partnership and perform active
and substantial managerial functions with respect thereto.   (b) General
Mills has no plan or intention to cause Pillsbury to issue additional shares
of its stock that would result in General Mills not having "control" of
Pillsbury. For purposes of this Section 7.2(b), "control" of a corporation
means the ownership of stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least
80 percent of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock
of such corporation.   (c) Merger Sub was formed by General Mills for
purposes of consummating the Merger, will have nominal assets at the time of
the Merger, has no liabilities and will have no liabilities at the time of
the Merger (other than pursuant to this Agreement), and will not transfer to
Pillsbury any assets subject to liabilities. Merger Sub has not conducted and
will not conduct any business activities or other operations of any kind
prior to the consummation of the Merger, other than the issuance of its stock
to General Mills.   (d) General Mills has no plan or intention to liquidate
Pillsbury, to merge Pillsbury with or into another corporation (other than
merging Merger Sub into Pillsbury in the Merger), or to sell or otherwise
dispose of the stock of Pillsbury except for transfers of stock described in
Code Section 368(a)(2)(C) or Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(k)(2).  
(e) General Mills shall not cause Pillsbury to take any Substantially All
Action. A "Substantially All Action" is a distribution by Pillsbury of assets
to a shareholder, the incurrence of indebtedness by Pillsbury (other than any
refinancing of indebtedness that exists at the time of the Merger) or
the repayment of Pillsbury indebtedness that exists at the time of the Merger
(other than any refinancing of such indebtedness), which distribution,
incurrence or repayment (i) occurs after the Merger and prior to the one year
anniversary thereof and (ii) (A)    -52-    causes Pillsbury to fail
to hold at least 90 percent of the fair market value of its net assets held
immediately prior to the Merger, (B) causes Pillsbury to fail to hold at
least 70 percent of the fair market value of its gross assets held
immediately prior to the Merger, (C) causes Pillsbury to fail to hold
at least 90 percent of the fair market value of Merger Sub\'s net assets
held immediately prior to the Merger or (D) causes Pillsbury to fail to hold
at least 70 percent of the fair market value of Merger Sub\'s gross assets
held immediately prior to the Merger. For purposes of this representation,
amounts paid by Pillsbury or Merger Sub to shareholders who receive cash or
other property, amounts used by Pillsbury or Merger Sub to pay
reorganization expenses, and all redemptions and distributions (except for
regular, normal dividends) made by Pillsbury or Merger Sub in connection with
the Merger will be included (to the extent that General Mills has knowledge
thereof) as assets of Pillsbury or Merger Sub, respectively, held immediately
prior to the Merger, and shares of General Mills Common Stock issued in the
Merger will not be so included.   Section 7.3. Tax Indemnification. (a)
From and after the Closing Date, the Diageo Tax Indemnitors shall pay or
cause to be paid, and jointly and severally shall indemnify each General
Mills Tax Indemnitee and protect, save and hold each General Mills Tax
Indemnitee harmless from and against the following Taxes:   (i) Any Tax
imposed upon or relating to Diageo or any of the  Continuing Affiliates for
any period, including any such Tax for which  any of the Business Entities
(or any Non-Controlled Foreign Entity or  Subsidiary thereof) may be liable
(w) under Section 1.1502-6 of the  Treasury Regulations (or any similar
provision of state, local or  foreign law), (x) as a transferee or successor,
(y) by contract or (z)  otherwise;   (ii) Any Tax imposed upon or relating
to any of the Business  Entities for any Pre-Closing Period; and   (iii)
Any Tax imposed upon, relating to or resulting from  (x) the Merger or the
provisions of Section 2.13 or 2.14 hereof  (except, in each case, to the
extent set forth in Section 7.3(b)(ii)  below), (y) any of the Subsidiary
Purchases or (z) any restructuring  undertaken in contemplation of the Merger
or any of the Subsidiary  Purchases.   (b) From and after the Closing Date,
the General Mills Tax Indemnitors shall pay or cause to be paid, and jointly
and severally shall indemnify each Diageo Tax Indemnitee and protect, save
and hold each Diageo Tax Indemnitee harmless from and against the following
Taxes:   (i) Any Tax imposed upon or relating to any of the Business 
Entities for any Post-Closing Period; and   (ii) Any Tax imposed upon the
Pillsbury Stockholder on the  Merger that would not have arisen but for a
breach by General Mills of  any of the representations set forth in Section
7.2.   (c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.7, payment in full
of any amount due to a Tax Indemnitee under this Section 7.3 shall be made to
the affected Tax Indem-    -53-    nitee in immediately available
funds at least two Business Days before the date payment of the Taxes to
which such payment relates is due.   Section 7.4. Section 338(g) Elections
for Purchased Entities. General Mills may, at its option, cause a timely and
irrevocable election (a "338 Election") under Section 338(g) of the Code (and
any corresponding provisions of state or local Tax law) to be made with
respect to any or all of the Purchased Entities or any of their respective
Subsidiaries which, in each case, is not, as of the date hereof, owned
directly or indirectly, by a U.S. corporation (the "338 Election
Subsidiaries"). If General Mills causes such elections to be made, each of
General Mills and Diageo shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
and Affiliates to, (i) treat the 338 Elections as valid, (ii) file all Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with such 338 Elections and the 338 Election
Allocations (as defined below) and (iii) take no position contrary thereto,
except to the extent required pursuant to a determination (as defined in
Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar state or local Tax provision)
(a "Determination"). With respect to each 338 Election, General Mills shall
prepare and submit to Diageo for Diageo\'s consent and agreement (i) the
aggregate deemed sale price (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.338-4T) (the "ADSP") and (ii) the allocation of the ADSP among the assets
of each of the 338 Election Subsidiaries (collectively, the "338 Election
Allocations"). The 338 Election Allocations shall be reasonable and shall be
determined in accordance with Section 338 of the Code and the applicable
Treasury Regulations thereunder. Diageo shall provide General Mills such
assistance as General Mills may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of any form or document required to effect a valid and timely 338
Election. Diageo shall not be responsible for any failure of an attempted 338
Election to be valid, except to the extent that such failure results from a
failure by Diageo to comply with its obligations under this Section 7.4.  
Section 7.5. Allocation of Certain Taxes. (a) If any of the Business Entities
is permitted but not required under applicable state, local or foreign income
Tax laws to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, then
the parties shall cause such Business Entity to treat that day as the
last day of a taxable period.   (b) In the case of Taxes arising in a
taxable period of any of the Business Entities that includes but does not end
on the Closing Date, except as provided in Section 7.5(c), the allocation of
such Taxes between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period shall
be made on the basis of an interim closing of the books as of the end of the
Closing Date. For purposes of this Article VII, (i) any Tax on gain or income
resulting from the triggering into income of deferred intercompany
transactions under Section 1.1502-13 of the Treasury Regulations or excess
loss accounts under Section 1.1502-19 of the Treasury Regulations that occurs
as a result of the Merger shall be considered to be attributable to the Pre-
Closing Period and (ii) each partnership or "flowthrough" entity in which any
of the Business Entities holds an interest shall be treated as if its taxable
year ended at the close of business on the Closing Date and Taxes
attributable to the income and gain of such entities through the close of
business on the Closing Date (as determined in a reasonably practicable
manner) shall be considered to be attributable to the Pre-Closing Period.  
(c) In the case of (i) franchise Taxes based on capitalization, debt or
shares of stock authorized, issued or outstanding and (ii) ad valorem
Taxes, in either case attributable to a Straddle Period (as defined below),
the portion of such Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Pe-   
-54-    riod shall be the amount of such Taxes for the entire taxable
period, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in such taxable period ending on and including the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the entire number of calendar days in such
taxable period, and the balance of such Taxes shall be attributable to the
Post-Closing Period; provided, however, that if any property, asset or other
right of any of the Business Entities is sold or otherwise transferred prior
to the Closing Date, then ad valorem Taxes pertaining to such property, asset
or other right shall be attributed entirely to the Pre-Closing Period.  
Section 7.6. Carryovers, Refunds and Related Matters. (a) Any refund or
credit of Taxes (including any interest thereon) that relates to any of
the Business Entities and that is a refund or credit of Taxes with respect to
a Pre-Closing Period shall be the property of Diageo or its designee and
shall be retained by Diageo or its designee (or promptly reimbursed to Diageo
or such designee by the Business Entity if any such refund or credit (or
interest thereon) is received by General Mills, a Business Entity or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates); provided, however, that any
refund, credit or other benefit actually received or realized in cash by
Diageo, any Continuing Affiliate or any Business Entity with respect to a
Pre-Closing Period that results from, and would not have resulted but for,
the carryback of any Tax attribute of General Mills, any Business Entity or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates arising in a Post-Closing
Period (to the extent that such carryback does not preclude or delay
utilization of a Diageo Group Tax attribute or Business Entity Pre-Closing
Period Tax attribute) shall be the property of and retained by the Business
Entity (or paid by Diageo to the Business Entity promptly after actual
receipt or realization in cash of such refund, credit or other benefit by
Diageo or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates).   (b) Any refund or
credit of Taxes (including any interest thereon) that relates to any of the
Business Entities and that is a refund or credit of Taxes with respect to a
Post-Closing Period shall be the property of General Mills or the Business
Entity and shall be retained by General Mills or the Business Entity (or
promptly paid by Diageo to General Mills or the Business Entity if any such
refund or credit (or interest thereon) is received by Diageo or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates); provided, however, that any refund, credit or
other benefit actually received or realized in cash by General Mills or any
Business Entity with respect to a Post-Closing Period that results from, and
would not have resulted but for, the carryover of any Business Entity
Tax attribute arising in a Pre-Closing Period (to the extent that such
carryover does not preclude or delay utilization of a General Mills Group Tax
attribute or Business Entity Post-Closing Period Tax attribute) shall be the
property of Diageo or its designee and shall be paid by the Business Entity
to Diageo or its designee promptly after actual receipt or realization in
cash of such refund, credit or other benefit by General Mills or a Business
Entity.   (c) In applying Section 7.6(a) and Section 7.6(b), (i) any refund
or credit of Taxes (including any interest thereon) for a Straddle Period
(as defined below) shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Period and
the Post-Closing Period in accordance with Section 7.5 and (ii) any foreign
tax that is deemed paid by a Business Entity in a taxable period pursuant to
Section 902 of the Code shall be considered to be "with respect to" such
taxable period, regardless of when the underlying foreign tax was actually
paid or accrued.   (d) In the event of any adjustment of a Pre-Closing
Period Tax deduction or income item of a Business Entity by a Taxing
Authority pursuant to a Determination (or other-    -55-    wise in a
Tax Proceeding), which adjustment results in a Tax benefit (determined for
purposes of this Section 7.6(d) after taking into account any preclusion
or delay in the utilization of any General Mills Group Tax attribute or
any Business Entity Post-Closing Period Tax attribute) actually received or
realized in cash by General Mills or any Business Entity and such Tax benefit
would not have been so received or realized but for such adjustment, then to
the extent such Tax benefit arises with respect to (the Post-Closing Period
portion of) a taxable period of a Business Entity ending on or prior to the
second anniversary of the Closing Date and would otherwise have been for the
account of General Mills hereunder, the Business Entity shall pay Diageo or
its designee the amount of such Tax benefit promptly after actual receipt or
realization in cash of such Tax benefit by General Mills or the Business
Entity.   (e) In the event of any adjustment of a Post-Closing Period
Tax deduction or income item of a Business Entity by a Taxing Authority
pursuant to a Determination (or otherwise in a Tax Proceeding), which
adjustment results in a Tax benefit (determined for purposes of this Section
7.6(e) after taking into account any preclusion or delay in the utilization
of any Diageo Group Tax attribute or any Business Entity Pre-Closing Period
Tax attribute) actually received or realized in cash by Diageo, any
Continuing Affiliate or any Business Entity and such Tax benefit would not
have been so received or realized but for such adjustment, then to the extent
such Tax benefit arises with respect to the Pre-Closing Period and would
otherwise have been for the account of Diageo hereunder, the Business Entity
shall retain such Tax benefit (or Diageo or its designee shall pay such
Business Entity the amount of such Tax benefit promptly after actual receipt
or realization in cash of such Tax benefit by Diageo or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates).   Section 7.7. Preparation and Filing of Tax
Returns. (a) Diageo shall file or cause to be filed (i) any combined,
consolidated or unitary Return that includes Diageo, the Pillsbury
Stockholder or any Continuing Affiliate and (ii) any other Return of any of
the Business Entities for any taxable period that ends on or before the
Closing Date. All such Returns shall be filed in a manner consistent with
past practice, shall not include any change in any method of accounting and
shall not include any Tax election that is inconsistent with past practice
(except for the 338 Elections). Diageo shall, reasonably promptly after the
filing of a Return described in clause (i) or (ii) above, provide
General Mills a copy of such Return (or a copy of a pro forma separate Return
in the case of a Return described in clause (i)). Diageo shall remit to the
relevant Taxing Authority all Taxes shown by such Returns to be due. General
Mills shall cause the Business Entities to furnish information to Diageo in
connection with any such Return, at Diageo\'s expense, in accordance with the
past procedures, customs and practices of Diageo.   (b) Except to the
extent set forth in Section 7.7(a), General Mills shall file or cause to be
filed all Returns of, or that include, any of the Business Entities.   (c)
With respect to any Return of any of the Business Entities for a taxable
period that, with respect to such Business Entity, begins on or before and
ends after the Closing Date (such a Return, a "Straddle Period Return"
and such a taxable period, a "Straddle Period"), General Mills shall deliver
a copy of such Return to Diageo at least 40 Business Days prior to the due
date (giving effect to any extension thereof), accompanied by an allocation
between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period of the Taxes shown
to be due on such Return. Such Return and allocation shall be final and
binding on Diageo, unless, within 10 Business Days after   
-56-    the date of receipt by Diageo of such Return and allocation,
Diageo delivers to General Mills a written request for changes to such Return
or allocation. If Diageo delivers such a request, then General Mills and
Diageo shall undertake in good faith to resolve the issues raised in such
request prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for filing
such Return. If General Mills and Diageo are unable to resolve any issue
within 10 Business Days from the date of receipt by General Mills of the
request for changes, then Diageo and General Mills jointly shall engage the
Neutral Auditors to determine the correct treatment of the item or items in
dispute. Each of Diageo and General Mills shall bear and pay one-half of the
fees and other costs charged by the Neutral Auditors. The determination of
the Neutral Auditors shall be final and binding on the parties hereto.  
(d) In the case of each Straddle Period Return, not later than two Business
Days before the due date (including any extension thereof) for payment of
Taxes with respect to such Return, Diageo shall pay to General Mills or
the relevant Business Entity the portion of the Taxes in connection with such
Return for which Diageo is responsible pursuant to Section 7.3.   Section
7.8. Tax Contests. (a) Notices. If any Taxing Authority asserts a Tax Claim,
then the party hereto first receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall
provide written notice thereof to the other party or parties hereto;
provided, however, that the failure of such party to give such prompt notice
shall not relieve the other party of any of its obligations under this
Article VII, except to the extent that the other party is actually prejudiced
thereby. Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such
Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant portion of
any correspondence received from the Taxing Authority.   (b) Pre-Closing
Taxable Periods. Diageo shall have the right to control, at its own expense,
any audit, examination, contest, litigation or other proceeding by or against
any Taxing Authority (a "Tax Proceeding") (A) in respect of a Business Entity
for any taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date or (B)
involving a challenge to the qualification of the Merger as a tax-free
"reorganization" within the meaning of Code Section 368; provided, however,
that (i) insofar as any such Tax Proceeding relates to the matters set forth
in clause (A) or (B) above, Diageo shall provide General Mills with a timely
and reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax Proceeding and (ii)
in the case of any Tax Proceeding involving a challenge to the qualification
of the Merger as a tax-free "reorganization" within the meaning of Code
Section 368 on the basis (in whole or in part) of the inaccuracy of any
of the representations made by General Mills and Merger Sub in Section 7.2,
(I) Diageo shall consult with General Mills before taking any significant
action in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (II) Diageo shall consult with
General Mills and offer General Mills an opportunity to comment before
submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in connection with

Indemnification Procedures. (a) Upon obtaining knowledge of any claim or
demand which has given rise to, or is expected to give rise to, a claim for
indemnification hereunder, General Mills or Diageo, as the case may be, shall
give written notice ("Notice of Claim") of such claim or demand to the other.
The party giving such Notice of Claim shall furnish to the other party
in reasonable detail such information as the General Mills Indemnified
Parties or the Diageo Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, may have with
respect to such indemnification claim (including copies of any summons,
complaint or other pleading which may have been served on it and any written
claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the
same). Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 9.2(b) and 9.3(b)
hereof, no failure or delay by General Mills or Diageo in the performance of
the foregoing shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligation of the Diageo
Indemnifying Parties or the General Mills Indemnifying Parties, respectively,
to indemnify and hold the General Mills Indemnified Parties or the Diageo
Indemnified Parties, respectively, harmless, except to the extent that such
failure or delay shall have actually adversely affected the General Mills
Indemnifying Parties\' or Diageo Indemnifying Parties\', as the case may be,
ability to defend against, settle or satisfy any Covered Losses for which the
party seeking indemnification is entitled to indemnification hereunder.  
(b) If the claim or demand set forth in the Notice of Claim given pursuant to
Section 9.4(a) hereof is a claim or demand asserted by a third party, the
party receiving such Notice of Claim shall have 15 days after the date on
which Notice of Claim is given to notify the party giving such Notice
of Claim in writing of its election to defend such third party claim or
demand on behalf of the party seeking indemnification. If the party receiving
such Notice of Claim elects, on behalf of the General Mills Indemnifying
Parties or Diageo Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be, to defend such
third party claim or demand, the party seeking indemnification shall make
available to the indemnifying party and its agents and representatives all
records and other materials which are reasonably required in the defense of
such third party claim or demand and shall otherwise cooperate with, and
assist the indemnifying party in the defense of, such third party claim or
demand, and so long as Diageo or General Mills, as the case may be, is
defending such third party claim in good faith, the General Mills Indemnified
Parties    -65-    or Diageo Indemnified Parties, as applicable, shall
not pay, settle or compromise such third party claim or demand. In such case,
the General Mills Indemnifying Parties or the Diageo Indemnifying Parties, as
the case may be, may pay, settle or compromise such third party claim or
demand (i) with the written consent of Diageo or General Mills, on behalf of
the Diageo Indemnified Parties or the General Mills Indemnified Parties, as
the case may be, or (ii) without such consent, so long as such settlement
includes (A) an unconditional release of the Diageo Indemnified Parties or
the General Mills Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, from all liability
in respect of such claim or litigation, (B) does not subject the indemnified
parties to any material injunctive relief or other material equitable remedy,
and (C) does not include a statement or admission of fault, culpability or
failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. If the party
receiving such Notice of Claim elects to defend such third party claim or
demand, the General Mills Indemnified Party or the Diageo Indemnified Party,
as the case may be, shall have the right to participate in the defense of
such third party claim or demand, at such indemnified party\'s own expense.
In the event, however, that such indemnified party reasonably determines that
representation by counsel to the indemnifying parties of both such
indemnifying parties and the indemnified party could reasonably be expected
to present such counsel with a conflict of interest, then the indemnified
party may employ separate counsel to represent or defend it in any such
action or proceeding and the indemnifying parties will pay the fees
and expenses of such counsel; provided, that the Diageo Indemnifying Parties
or the General Mills Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be, shall not, in
connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same
jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate
firm of attorneys (in addition to local counsel) at any time for all General
Mills Indemnified Parties or Diageo Indemnified Parties, as the case may be.
If the party receiving such Notice of Claim does not elect to defend such
third party claim or demand or does not defend such third party claim or
demand in good faith, the General Mills Indemnified Parties or Diageo
Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, shall have the right, in addition to
any other right or remedy they may have hereunder, at the Diageo Indemnifying
Parties\' or General Mills Indemnifying Parties\', as the case may be,
expense, to defend such third party claim or demand; provided, however, that
(i) such General Mills Indemnified Parties or Diageo Indemnified Parties, as
the case may be, shall not have any obligation to participate in the defense
of, or defend, any such third party claim or demand; (ii) such General Mills
Indemnified Parties\' or Diageo Indemnified Parties\', as the case may be,
defense of or participation in the defense of any such third party claim or
demand shall not in any way diminish or lessen the obligations of the Diageo
Indemnifying Parties or General Mills Indemnifying Parties, as applicable,
under the agreements of indemnification set forth in this Article IX; and
(iii) such General Mills Indemnified Parties or Diageo Indemnified Parties,
as the case may be, may not settle any claim without the consent of Diageo or
General Mills, respectively, on behalf of the Diageo Indemnifying Parties or
General Mills Indemnifying Parties, respectively (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).   (c) Diageo and General Mills shall
cooperate in the defense of any claim or litigation subject to this Article
IX and the records of each shall be available to the other with respect to
such defense.   (d) Except for third party claims being defended in good
faith, (i) Diageo shall satisfy the Diageo Indemnifying Parties\' obligations
under this Article IX in respect of a valid claim for indemnification
hereunder which is not contested by Diageo in good faith, at its election,
either (A) in cash or (B) by payment in the form of a number of shares of
General Mills    -66-    Common Stock equal to (x) the amount of such
obligation divided by (y) Market Value on the date of delivery of such
shares, in either case within 30 days after the date on which Notice of Claim
is given and (ii) General Mills shall satisfy the General Mills Indemnifying
Parties\' obligations under this Article IX in respect of a valid claim for
indemnification hereunder which is not contested by General Mills in good
faith within 30 days after the date on which Notice of Claim is given by
payment in the form of a number of shares of General Mills Common Stock equal
to (A) the amount of such obligation divided by (B) the Market Value on the
date of delivery of such shares.   Section 9.5. Limitations on
Indemnification. (a) The Diageo Indemnifying Parties shall have no liability
for indemnification pursuant to clause (i) of Section 9.2(a) with respect to
Covered Losses for which indemnification is provided thereunder, unless such
Covered Losses exceed in the aggregate $100 million, in which case the Diageo
Indemnifying Parties shall be liable for all such Covered Losses in excess of
such amount; provided, that the Diageo Indemnifying Parties shall have no
liability for such Covered Losses (and such Covered Losses will not be
aggregated for purposes of such $100 million) in connection with any
individual claim or series of related claims unless the aggregate amount of
Covered Losses associated with such claim or series of related claims exceeds
$5 million.   (b) The General Mills Indemnifying Parties shall have no
liability for indemnification pursuant to clause (i) of Section 9.3(a) with
respect to Covered Losses for which indemnification is provided thereunder,
unless such Covered Losses exceed in the aggregate $100 million, in which
case the General Mills Indemnifying Parties shall be liable for all such
Covered Losses in excess of such amount; provided, that the General Mills
Indemnifying Parties shall have no liability for such Covered Losses (and
such Covered Losses will not be aggregated for purposes of such $100 million)
in connection with any individual claim or any series of related claims
unless the aggregate amount of Covered Losses associated with such claim or

Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware without reference to the choice of law principles
thereof.   (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware state or federal court of appropriate
jurisdiction in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or

claims in respect of such Action may be heard and determined in such Delaware
state or federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives,
to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action. The parties further
agree, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, that any final and
unappealable judgment against any of them in any Action contemplated above
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or
outside the United States by suit on the    -69-    judgment, a
certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount
of such judgment.   (c) To the extent that any party hereto has or hereafter
may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal
process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to
itself or its property, such party hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in
respect of its obligations with respect to this Agreement.   (d) Each party
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may
have to a trial by jury in respect of any Action arising out of or relating
to this Agreement. Each party certifies that it has been induced to enter
into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications set forth above in this Section 11.2.   Section 11.3. Entire
Agreement. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, the Schedules and
Exhibits hereto and thereto, and the Confidentiality Agreement contain the
entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and there are no agreements, understandings, representations or
warranties between the parties other than those set forth or referred to

Agreement and the Subsidiary Purchase Agreements, whether the Merger is or is
