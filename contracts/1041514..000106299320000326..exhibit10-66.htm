to the Leakage Dispute to be present while oral representations are being made
to the Leakage Expert by the other Party, and require a Party to the Leakage
Dispute to supply to the other Party a copy of any written representations at
the same time as they are supplied to the Leakage Expert;

portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the amount
actually contested between the Parties, as determined by the Leakage Expert.

Leakage Expert and the Seller shall pay 75% of the costs of the Leakage
Expert; and

shall comply with all reasonable requests (including requests for information

_**ARTICLE VI**_ 
 _ **INDEMNIFICATION**_

 

6.1. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, the Purchaser
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller, its Affiliates and
their respective shareholders, officers, directors, employees and agents
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Seller Party_ ") from and against (i) any
and all Losses that incurred as a result of any inaccuracy in or breach of any
of the warranties made by the Purchaser in _Section 3.3_ in this Agreement,
and (ii) any and all Losses that incurred as a result of any breach of, or
failure by the Purchaser to perform any of the Purchaser\'s covenants,
agreements or other obligations contained in this Agreement.

 

 

33 (b) Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, including
_Sections 6.5_ and _6.6_ , the Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Purchaser, its Affiliates and their respective shareholders,
officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Purchaser Party_ ") from and against (i) any and all Losses that incurred as a
result of any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the warranties made by the
Seller in _Section 3.1_ or _3.2_ in this Agreement, and (ii) any and all
Losses that incurred as a result of any breach of, or failure by the Seller to
perform any of the Seller\'s covenants, agreements or other obligations
contained in this Agreement.

 

6.2. _Survival_. The warranties of the Parties contained in _Article III_ in
this Agreement and any claims based on breach or inaccuracy of the same shall
survive the Completion for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the
Completion Date (other than the Fundamental Warranties, which shall survive in
full force and effect until the date that is seven (7) years after the
Completion Date), provided that none of covenants, obligations and other
agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive the Completion Date other
than those which by their terms contemplate performance after the Completion
Date.

 

6.3. _Limitations on Liability_.

 

(a) No indemnification claim may be asserted against either Party unless
written notice of such claim is received by such Party (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ "), describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with
respect to the subject matter of such claim and, with respect to claims
pursuant to _Sections 6.1(a)_ and _6.1(b)_ , on or prior to the end of the
applicable survival period stated in _Section 6.2_ from the Party seeking
indemnification (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ").

 

(b) Except in case of fraud by the Seller, under no circumstances shall the
indemnification obligations of the Seller, in the aggregate, exceed US$1 in
case of any claim arising under _Section 6.1(b)(i)_.

 

(c) Any Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable efforts to avoid or
mitigate any Losses which in the absence of mitigation might give rise to, or
increase, a liability in respect of any claim under this Agreement.

 

(d) In calculating the amount of any Losses payable to an Indemnified Party
hereunder, the amount of such Losses (i) shall not be duplicative of any other
Loss for which an indemnification claim has been actually paid, (ii) shall be
computed net of any amounts that such Indemnified Party is or may be entitled
to claim for (the " _Third Party Indemnification Amount_ ") under any other
indemnification agreements, understanding or similar arrangements other than
this Agreement with respect to such Losses, and (iii) shall be computed net of
any amounts that such Indemnified Party is or may be entitled to claim for
under any insurance policy with respect to such Losses. The Indemnified Party
shall use its best efforts to seek a remedy under such indemnification
agreements, understanding, insurance policy or other similar arrangements
prior to seeking indemnification from the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party pays an Indemnified Party for a claim and subsequently
insurance proceeds or the Third Party Indemnification Amount, as the case may
be, in respect of such claim is collected by such Indemnified Party, then such
Indemnified Party promptly shall remit to the Indemnifying Party the insurance
proceeds or the Third Party Indemnification Amount, as the case may be, up to
the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party. In
calculating the liability of the Seller in respect of any claim, there shall
be taken into account any net quantifiable financial benefit to the
Indemnified Purchaser Party as a result of the matter giving rise to such
claim, including the amount by which any Tax for which the Indemnified
Purchaser Party is accountable, liable to be assessed, is actually reduced or
extinguished (including by way of a credit applied to future Taxes payable) as
a result thereof. For the purpose of this _Section 6.3(d)_ , recovery by, or
financial benefit of, the Purchaser, the Group Companies or their respective
Affiliate shall be deemed to be a recovery by, or financial benefit of, each
of them.

 

 

34 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Party
shall be liable to the other Party for any consequential, indirect, special,
punitive or incidental damages; provided that the foregoing limitation shall
not relieve such Party from liability for damages to the extent such damages
are awarded to a third party in connection with a Third Party Claim..

 

(f) For purposes of this _Article VI_ , the Seller shall not be liable for any
Losses based upon or arising out of (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any of the
warranties of the Seller contained in this Agreement if the Purchaser had
knowledge of such inaccuracy or breach prior to the Completion, (ii) any
facts, events, or occurrence fairly disclosed in the information or materials
set forth in, or that can be obtained through, the Seller Disclosure
Schedules, the Data Room or public searches, as the case may be, (iii) any
voluntary act, omission, transaction or arrangement by the Purchaser, (iv)
matters to which the claims relate is specifically provided for in the Group
Companies Financial Statements, (v) the passing of, or any change in, after
the Completion Date, any Law or accounting rules, or (vi) any change in the
enforcement, implementation or interpretation of the relevant Tax rules,
policies, and rates.

 

(g) The disclosure of any item in the Seller Disclosure Schedules shall be
deemed a disclosure with respect to any warranties if the relevance of such
item to those warranties is reasonably apparent from the face of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules.

 

6.4. _Claims for Indemnification_. _ 
_

 

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. All claims for indemnification made under this
Agreement resulting from, related to or arising out of a third-party claim
against an Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") shall be made in
accordance with the following procedures. An Indemnified Party shall give
prompt written notification (not more than thirty (30) days after becoming
aware of any Third Party Claim) to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement
of any action, suit or proceeding relating to a Third-Party Claim for which
indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the assertion of any such
claim by a third party; provided _,_ that no delay on the part of the
Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any obligation under this _Article VI_ except to the
extent such delay actually and materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party.
Such notification shall include a description in reasonable detail, to the
extent known at the time, of the facts constituting the basis for such Third-
Party Claim, any material information received by the Indemnified Party which
is reasonably relevant to the applicable Third Party Claim, and the amount of
the Losses claimed. At any time after delivery of such notification, the
Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party,
assume control of the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or claim, at
the Indemnifying Party\'s expense. The Indemnified Party shall take any
actions reasonably necessary and in good faith to defend such Third Party
Claim prior to the time that it receives a notice from the Indemnifying Party
as contemplated by the foregoing sentence. The Indemnified Party shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective shareholders,
officers, directors, employees and agents to, cooperate reasonably with the
Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party, at the Indemnifying Party\'s reasonable expense, all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party\'s
possession or under the Indemnified Party\'s control relating thereto as is
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. The Party not controlling such
defense may participate therein at its own expense. The Party controlling such
defense shall keep the other Party advised of the status of such action, suit,
proceeding or claim and the defense thereof and shall have the right to settle
such action, suit, proceeding or claim; provided, however, that (i) the
Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such action, suit,
proceeding or claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of
such action, suit, proceeding or claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, unless such settlement does not impose injunctive or
equitable relief on the Indemnified Party and includes a complete release of
the Indemnified Party without prejudice.

 

 

35 (b) _Procedure for Claims_. In the event an Indemnified Party claims a right
to payment pursuant hereto with respect to any matter not involving a Third-
Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall send written
notice of such claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party (a " _Notice of
Claim_ "). Such Notice of Claim shall specify in reasonable detail the legal
basis for and the underlying facts of such Direct Claim. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Parties agree and understand that Notice of Claim in respect of a
breach of a warranty must be sent by the Purchaser prior to the expiration of
the relevant survival period for such warranty under _Section 6.2_.

 

(c) _Access to Information_. In the event of an actual or potential claim, the
Purchaser shall procure that the Seller and its representatives are provided,
upon reasonable notice, with all such assistance, documentation, information
and access to premises and personnel of the Group Companies as they may
reasonably require to investigate, avoid, remedy, dispute, resist, appeal,
compromise or contest such claim and shall permit the Seller and its
representatives to make copies of such documentation and information to the
extent relevant to the claim.

 

6.5. _W andI Insurance_.

 

As of the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall have procured the WandI
insurance policy (the " _W andI Insurance Policy_") from the WandI Insurance
Company on terms disclosed to the Seller, which shall contain a waiver of the
WandI Insurance Company of its rights of subrogation, claims in contribution and
rights acquired by assignment against the Seller (except in case of fraud by
the Seller). For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall have no obligations
towards any premiums or payments to be made in connection with the obtainment
and maintenance of the WandI Insurance Policy. In the event of any conflict or
other inconsistency between the terms of this _Section 6.5_ and any other
provisions of this Agreement or any other contract, agreement or arrangement
entered into by either the Purchaser or the Seller in connection with the
Transaction (including the WandI Insurance Policy, as between the Parties), the
terms of this _Section 6.5_ shall prevail. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser:

 

 

36 (a) hereby warrants to the Seller that the executed copy of the WandI Insurance
Policy delivered by the Purchaser to the Seller on the date of this Agreement
is true, complete and up-to-date;

 

(b) acknowledges and agrees that, in reliance upon the WandI Insurance Policy,
neither the Purchaser nor any other Indemnified Purchaser Party shall be
entitled to make, and the Purchaser waives on behalf of itself and all the
other Indemnified Purchaser Parties any right such Person may have to make,
any claim against the Seller arising out of, and the Seller shall not be
liable for, any Losses suffered or incurred by any Indemnified Purchaser Party
in connection with any claims of any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
warranties made by the Seller in _Section 3.1_ or _Section 3.2_ in this
Agreement, except in case of fraud by the Seller;

 

(c) acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement or any other contract, agreement or arrangement entered into by
either the Seller or the Purchaser in connection with the Transaction
(including the WandI Insurance Policy), the Seller provides _Sections 3.1_ and
_3.2_ in this Agreement and (to the extent relating to any inaccuracy in or
breach of any warranty set forth in _Section 3.1_ or _Section 3.2_ ) _Section
6.1(b)(i)_ hereof to the Purchaser solely for purposes of satisfying the
condition set forth in _Section 5.2(c)_ in this Agreement and to enable the
Purchaser to make claims against the WandI Insurance Company under the WandI
Insurance Policy for any inaccuracy in or breach of any warranty set forth in
_Sections 3.1_ and _3.2_ hereof, and any and all claims for any inaccuracy in
or breach of any warranty set forth in _Section 3.1_ or _Section 3.2_ by any
Indemnified Purchaser Party shall be made exclusively against the WandI
Insurance Company under the WandI Insurance Policy and, as such, the Indemnified
Purchaser Parties shall not make any claim against the Seller as a result of
any Loss, except in case of fraud by the Seller;

 

(d) acknowledges that the Seller has entered into this Agreement and will
complete the Transaction in reliance on the Purchaser having obtained the WandI
Insurance Policy and the provisions of this _Section 6.5_ and _Section 6.6_ ;

and releases any right it may have to make, any claims for any inaccuracy in
or breach of any of the warranties made by the Seller in _Section 3.1_ or
_Section 3.2_ in this Agreement against the Seller, except in case of fraud by
the Seller; and

 

(f) agrees that the provisions of this _Section 6.5_ will still apply
notwithstanding that the Purchaser is or may be unable to pursue or obtain any
remedy under the WandI Insurance Policy, whether due to policy validity
(including if the WandI Insurance Policy is invalid due to the insolvency,
breach or default of any Person), creditworthiness or otherwise.

 

6.6.6.6. _W andI Insurance Covenants_. The Purchaser covenants with the Seller
that it shall:

 

(a) not (without the prior written consent of the Seller) agree to any
amendment, variation or waiver of the WandI Insurance Policy (or do anything
which has a similar effect);

 

(b) not (without the prior written consent of the Seller) novate, or otherwise
assign its rights under, the WandI Insurance Policy (or do anything which has
similar effect), save that the Purchaser may assign its rights under the WandI
Insurance Policy by way of security to the bank(s) providing debt financing
for the acquisition of the Ownership Interest;

 

 

37 (c) not (without the prior written consent of the Seller) vitiate, terminate,
cancel or rescind the WandI Insurance Policy or take any steps to bring about or
result in the WandI Insurance Policy to be vitiated, terminated, cancelled or
rescinded or do anything which causes any right under the WandI Insurance Policy
not to have full force and effect;

 

(d) comply with the terms of any deliverables and payment obligations set out
in the WandI Insurance Policy; and

rights) against the Seller or any of its Affiliates and any Person for whom
they are vicariously or contractually liable (such as their directors and
officers) (together, the " _Released Parties_ ") (save in relation to fraud by
the Seller, in which case the WandI Insurance Company shall be entitled to
exercise its rights of subrogation, contribution and rights acquired by
assignment (or any similar or equivalent rights) against the Seller), and an
acknowledgment by the WandI Insurance Company that each of the Released Parties
is entitled to directly enforce such waiver and release (and in respect of the
waivers and releases the Purchaser contracts with the WandI Insurance Company in
its own right and on trust for and for the benefit of each of the Released
Parties).

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if there is any conflict or
inconsistency between (i) _Sections 6.5_ and _6.6_ and (ii) any other
provisions of this Agreement, _Sections 6.5_ and _6.6_ shall prevail.

 

6.7. _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Completion, the rights
provided to the Parties under _Article VI_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the Indemnified Party with respect to claims under this Agreement
or otherwise relating to the Transaction, provided, that notwithstanding

_**RECITALS**_ **:**

 

**WHEREAS** , Pledgor and Pledgee entered into that certain Purchase Agreement
(the " _PA_ ") dated as of January 23, 2020, pursuant to which Pledgor agreed
to sell to Pledgee, and Pledgee agreed to purchase from Pledgor, the Ownership
Interest. Capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meanings defined
in the PA unless otherwise defined herein; and

 

**WHEREAS** , immediately following the payment of the Contract Deposit in
accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ of the PA into the bank account (the " _Bank
Account_ ") held in the name of Pledgor at [•] Branch of KEB Hana Bank (the "
_Bank_ "), details of which shall be as set forth on _Annex A_ , in order to
secure the obligation of Pledgor to return the Contract Deposit (and interest
accrued thereon) upon the occurrence of an event requiring such return
pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)(ii)_ of the PA (the " _Secured Obligation_ "),
Pledgor desires to establish a first priority _kun_ -pledge in favor of
Pledgee over the Bank Account, in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_ of the PA
and subject to the terms and conditions hereof.

 

**NOW, THEREFORE** , the Parties agree as follows:

 

**ARTICLE 1. ** **ESTABLISHMENT OF PLEDGE**

 

1.1 Pledgor, as the legal and beneficial owner of the Bank Account, hereby
establishes a first priority _kun_ -pledge (" _il-sun-wi-kun-jil-kwon_ ") in
favor of Pledgee, on its right to claim the Contract Deposit in the Bank
Account and interest accrued thereon from the Bank (the " _Deposit Claim
Right_ ", and such pledge being the " _Pledge_ "), and Pledgee hereby accepts
such Pledge, as collateral security for the due and punctual payment,
performance and discharge of the Secured Obligation.

 

1.2 Pledgor shall, on the Effective Date and immediately following its receipt
of the Contract Deposit from Pledgee, (a) send the Notification and Acceptance
of Establishment of Pledge in the form and substance set forth in _Attachment
1.2_ to the Bank, (b) procure from the Bank an acceptance of the Notification
and Acceptance of Establishment of Pledge with a fixed date seal affixed
thereon, and (c) deliver an original thereof to Pledgee.

  **ARTICLE 2.** **OBLIGATIONS OF PLEDGOR**

 

2.1 Pledgor shall not assign, transfer, sell, further pledge or otherwise
encumber the Deposit Claim Right.

 

2.2 Pledgor shall procure that (a) the Deposit Claim Right is not attached or
provisionally attached, and (b) the Bank does not have any right to set off
any of its claims against Pledgor against the Deposit Claim Right.

 

**ARTICLE 3. ** **SCOPE OF PLEDGE**

 

The scope of the Pledge shall extend to the balance of the Bank Account,
including the Contract Deposit and any interest accrued thereon.

 

**ARTICLE 4. ** **ENFORCEMENT OF PLEDGE**

 

Upon a failure by Pledgor to perform the Secured Obligation in full, Pledgee
shall become forthwith entitled, as and when it sees fit, to put into force
and to exercise all or any of the power possessed by Pledgee as the pledgee of
the Deposit Claim Right in or towards the satisfaction of the Secured
Obligation, including the right and power to demand, sue for, collect or
receive, in the name of Pledgee, any money or property at any time payable or
receivable on account of or in exchange for any of the Deposit Claim Right,
but shall be under no obligation to do so.

 

**ARTICLE 5. ** **TERMINATION OF PLEDGE**

 

5.1 The Pledge shall be deemed automatically terminated concurrently upon the
Completion pursuant to _Section 2.5_ of the PA, in which case the Contract
Deposit, including any interest accrued thereon, shall be retained by Pledgor.

 

5.2 In the event the PA is terminated and, as a result of such termination,
the Contract Deposit, including any interest accrued thereon, is forfeited for
the benefit of, and retained by, the Seller in accordance with _Section
7.2(b)(i)_ of the PA, the Pledge shall be deemed automatically terminated at
the time of such termination of the PA.

 

5.3 In the event the PA is terminated and Pledgor is obligated to return the
Contract Deposit, including any interest accrued thereon, in accordance with
the terms of the PA, the Pledge shall be automatically terminated
simultaneously with such termination of the PA, and the Parties shall take
actions required or necessary to return the Contract Deposit to Pledgee
pursuant to the terms of the PA as soon as practicable, but in no event later
than five (5) Business Days from the date of the termination of the Pledge.

 

5.4 If the Pledge is terminated pursuant to _Section 5.1_ or _Section 5.2_
hereof, Pledgee shall immediately give a notice of termination and release to
the Bank in the form and substance set forth in _Attachment 5.4_ to the Bank
and take such other actions requested by the Pledgor to effectuate and perfect
the release of the Pledge including delivering to Pledgor documents necessary
for the release of the Pledge.

  **ARTICLE 6. ** **MISCELLANEOUS**
