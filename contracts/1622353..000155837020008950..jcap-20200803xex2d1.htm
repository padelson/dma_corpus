(a)Since January 1, 2017, the Company has filed with or otherwise furnished to
the SEC all registration statements, prospectuses, forms, reports, definitive
proxy statements, schedules and documents required to be filed or furnished by
it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, together
with all certifications required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
(the " **Sarbanes-Oxley Act** ") (such documents and any other documents filed
by the Company with the SEC, as they may have been supplemented, modified or
amended since the time of filing, including those filed or furnished
subsequent to the date hereof, collectively, the " **Company SEC Documents**
"), except where the failure to file (or furnish, as applicable) such Company
SEC Document would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of their respective
filing (or furnishing) dates or, if supplemented, modified or amended since
the time of filing, as of the date of the most recent supplement, modification
or amendment, the Company SEC Documents (i) did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (ii)
complied in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be, in each case as in
effect on the date each such document was filed with or furnished to the SEC.
None of the Company Subsidiaries is currently subject to the periodic
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company has made available to
Parent all comment letters and all material correspondence between the SEC, on
the one hand, and the Company or ​

the Operating Company, on the other hand, since January 1, 2017\. As of the

Act and the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations
of the New York Stock Exchange. The audited consolidated financial statements

consolidated Company Subsidiaries included in or incorporated by reference
into the Company SEC Documents (collectively, the " **Company Financial
Statements** ") (i) were prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles as applied in the United States (" **GAAP** ") (as in

reliability of financial reporting for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries. The Company has designed disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to provide
reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. To the knowledge of the Company, such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective in timely alerting the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of the Company to material information
relating to the Company required to be included in the reports the Company is
required to file under the Exchange Act, and the Company's principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the Company's
independent registered public accounting firm and the audit committee of the
Company Board (A) all known significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (B) any known fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.

internal control over financial reporting (whether or not remediated), except

aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is also in
compliance with all of the other applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and the applicable listing and corporate governance rules of the New York
Stock Exchange, except for ​

any non-compliance that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

commitment to become a party to, any material joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar material contract or arrangement, including any
contract relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Company and any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
affiliate of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
hand, or any securitization transaction or "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as
defined in Item 303(c) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act) (i) where the
result, purpose or intended effect of such transaction or arrangement is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in their published
financial statements or other Company SEC Documents or (ii) that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of

necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement,

Letter as a partnership, joint venture, or limited liability company has,
since the later of the date of its formation and the date on which the Company
acquired an interest in such entity, been treated for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity, as the case may be, and not
as a corporation or an association Taxable as a corporation. Each entity that
is listed in _Section 4.13(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter as a
corporation has, since the later of the date of its formation or the date on
which the Company acquired an interest in such entity, been treated for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes as a REIT, a "qualified REIT subsidiary" pursuant
to Section 856(i) of the Code (a " **QRS** ") or a "taxable REIT subsidiary"
pursuant to Section 856(1) of the Code (a " **TRS** ") as set forth on such
schedule. Each entity that is listed in _Section 4.13(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter as a REIT has been, since the date of its formation, treated

interest and redetermined TRS service income" described in Section 857(b)(7)

default, breach or failure of condition under the Equity Commitment Letter,

not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Equity Financing contemplated
by any of the Equity Commitment Letter will not be made available on the

fact or occurrence that makes any of the assumptions, or any of the
representations and warranties of Parent, in any of the Equity Commitment
Letter inaccurate in any material respect and no Equity Sponsor has notified
Parent or any of its affiliates of its termination or repudiation (or intent
to terminate or repudiate) any of the commitments under the Equity Commitment

including the payment of the Merger Consideration, the Operating Company
Merger Consideration and the Series B Preferred Merger Consideration, the

Agreement that it obtain financing for or related to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment ​

or supplement thereto), or responding to any comments of the SEC or its staff

circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or their respective officers, trustees or directors, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, which, pursuant to
the Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the
Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall
promptly inform the other Parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Company's stockholders. All

seeking the Company Requisite Vote. The record date of the Company
Stockholders' Meeting shall be selected by the Company after reasonable
consultation with Parent. The Company, through the Company Board, shall
recommend to holders of the Company Shares that they vote in favor of the
Company Merger so that the Company may obtain the Company Requisite Vote (the
" **Company Recommendation** ") and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to solicit the Company Requisite Vote (including by soliciting proxies
from the Company's stockholders), except in each case to the extent that the
Company Board has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, as permitted by

reasonably informed with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably
requested by Parent. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms, the Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any
Company Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company

extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement is provided to the holders of Company Shares within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of a vote on the Company Merger, (b) for
the absence of a quorum or (c) if additional time is reasonably required to
solicit proxies in favor of the approval of the Company Merger; _provided_ ,
that, in the case of this clause (c), without the written consent of Parent,
in no event will the Company Stockholders' Meeting (as so postponed or
adjourned) be held on a date that is more than 30 days after the date for
which the Company Stockholders' Meeting was originally scheduled. Unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ , the
obligation of the Company to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders' Meeting and mail the Proxy Statement (and any amendment
or supplement thereto that may be required by Law) to the Company's
stockholders will not be affected by an Adverse Recommendation Change. ​

Acquisition Proposal (an " **Inquiry** "), including by providing information
(including non-public information) relating to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and affording access to the business, properties, assets, books,
records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to any third party (and such third party's
Representatives, including potential financing sources of such third party)
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any non-public information concerning the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries that is provided to such third party (or its Representatives)
shall, to the extent not previously provided to Parent, be provided to Parent
as promptly as practicable after providing it to such third party (and in any
event within 24 hours thereafter); and (ii) engage in, enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any thirty party

any Company Acquisition Proposal (or any Inquiry), including granting a
waiver, amendment or release under any pre-existing standstill or similar
provision to the extent necessary to allow for a Company Acquisition Proposal
or amendment to a Company Acquisition Proposal (or any Inquiry) to be made to
the Company or the Company Board. As promptly as practicable, and in any event
within 24 hours following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a written notice setting forth the identity of each Person
or group of Persons from whom the Company or any of its Representatives has
received a Company Acquisition Proposal following the date of this Agreement
and prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date.

(b)Except as it may relate to any Excluded Party and subject to the other
provisions of this _Section 6.6_ , from and after the No-Shop Period Start
Date until the earlier of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article VIII_ and the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company agrees that
it shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and its and their
officers and directors to, and shall direct its and their other
Representatives to (i) immediately cease any solicitations, discussions,
negotiations or communications with any Person that may be ongoing with
respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal that would be prohibited by this
_Section 6.6(b)_ ; (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all non-
public information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiaries
theretofore furnished to any such Person with whom a confidentiality agreement
was entered into at any time within the one-year period immediately preceding
the No-Shop Period Start Date; (iii) cease providing any further information
with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiaries or any Company
Acquisition Proposal to any such Person or its Representatives; and (iv)
terminate all access granted to any such Person and its Representatives to any
physical or electronic data room. Subject to the other provisions of this
_Section 6.6_ , from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company
agrees that it shall not, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and
its and their officers and directors not to, and shall not authorize and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and their other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly through another Person, (A)
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any Inquiry,
including by providing information (including non-public information) relating
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary and affording access to the business,
properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any
personnel, of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any third party (or
such third party's Representatives), (B) engage in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any third party any non-public
information in connection with, or knowingly facilitate in any way any effort
by, any third party in furtherance of any Company Acquisition Proposal or
Inquiry, (C) approve or recommend a Company Acquisition Proposal, (D) enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, share purchase agreement,
asset purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other
similar definitive agreement (but excluding an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) providing for a transaction that is the subject of a Company
Acquisition Proposal or requiring the Company or the Operating Company to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (any of the foregoing referred in this clause (D), an "
**Alternative Acquisition Agreement** "), or (E) propose or agree to do any of
the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, including the
occurrence of the No-Shop Period Start Date, from and after the No-Shop Period
Start Date, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives may continue to engage in the activities described in _Section
6.6(a)_ with respect to any Excluded Party (and its Representatives, including
potential financing sources of such Excluded Party), including with respect to
any amended or modified Company Acquisition Proposal submitted by any Excluded
Party following the No-Shop Period Start Date, and the restrictions in this
_Section 6.6(b)_ shall not apply with respect thereto. ​

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries may, directly or indirectly, through any Representative, in
response to an unsolicited written _bona fide_ Company Acquisition Proposal by
a third party made after the date of this Agreement (that did not result from
a material breach of this _Section 6.6_ , it being agreed that the Company
Board may contact and engage in discussions with any Person making such a
written Company Acquisition Proposal solely to request clarification of the
terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether such Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal), and if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company and
its Representatives may, in response to such Company Acquisition Proposal, (i)
furnish non-public information to such third party (and such third party's
Representatives, including potential financing sources of such third party)
making such a Company Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that (A)
prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from the third
party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) any material
non-public information concerning the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries that is provided to such third party (or its Representatives)
shall, to the extent not previously provided to Parent, be provided to Parent
as promptly as practicable after providing it to such third party (and in any
event within 24 hours thereafter)), and (ii) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such third party (and such third party's Representatives,
including potential financing sources of such third party) with respect to the
Company Acquisition Proposal.

(d)The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24
hours) after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for
non-public information regarding the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any
third party that informs the Company that it is considering making, or has
made, a Company Acquisition Proposal, or any other Inquiry from any Person
seeking to have discussions or negotiations with the Company regarding a
possible Company Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made in writing
and shall identify the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal or
Inquiry and indicate the material terms and conditions of any Company
Acquisition Proposals or Inquiries, to the extent known (including, if
applicable, providing copies of any written Company Acquisition Proposals or
Inquiries and any proposed agreements related thereto, which may be redacted
to the extent necessary to protect confidential information of the business or
operations of the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry).
The Company shall also promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
Parent, in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning
any Company Acquisition Proposal or provides non-public information to any
Person in each case in accordance with _Section 6.6(c)_ , notify Parent of any
change to the financial and other material terms and conditions of any Company
Acquisition Proposal and otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed of the
status and terms of any Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry on a
reasonably current basis, including by providing a copy of all written
proposals, offers, drafts of proposed agreements or correspondence relating
thereto. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall, after the date
of this Agreement, enter into any confidential or similar agreement that would
prohibit it from providing such information to Parent.

(e)Except as permitted by this _Section 6.6(e)_ , neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (A) (i) change, withhold, withdraw, modify or
qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or resolve to or publicly propose or
announce its intention to change, withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in a
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt or
recommend or resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to
approve, adopt or recommend any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to
include the ​

Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iv) within five Business Days
of Parent's written request, fail to make or reaffirm the Company
Recommendation following the date any Company Acquisition Proposal or any
material modification thereto is first published or sent or given to the
stockholders of the Company, (v) fail to recommend, in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, against any Company
Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer subject to
Regulation 14D promulgated under the Exchange Act within 10 Business Days
after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer, or (vi) publicly propose or agree
to any of the foregoing (any of the actions described in clauses (i) through
(vi) of this _Section 6.6(e)_ , an " **Adverse Recommendation Change** ") or
(B) approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend (or agree to, resolve or
propose to approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend), or cause or permit
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter into, any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in accordance with this _Section 6.6_ ) or publicly propose or
announce its intention to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Requisite Vote, the Company Board may (x) effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change if an Intervening Event has occurred and the Company
Board determines, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors' duties under applicable Law, or (y) if the Company is not
in material breach of this _Section 6.6_ , effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ , in
each case in this clause (y), (1) in response to an unsolicited written _bona
fide_ Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior Proposal after having complied with, and giving effect
to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to, _Section
6.6(f)_ and such Company Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn, and (2) the
Company Board determines, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors' duties under applicable Law.

(f)The Company Board will only be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ as
permitted under _Section 6.6(e)_ if (i) the Company has provided a prior
written notice (a " **Notice of Change of Recommendation** ") to Parent that
the Company intends to take such action, identifying the Person making the
Superior Proposal and describing the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, that is the basis of
such action, including, if applicable, copies of any written proposals or
offers and any proposed written agreements related to a Superior Proposal (it
being agreed that the delivery of the Notice of Change of Recommendation by
the Company will not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), (ii) during
the four Business Day period following Parent's receipt of the Notice of
Change of Recommendation (a " **Notice of Change Period** "), the Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that, in the case of a Superior Proposal, such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, or, in the case of
an Intervening Event, in order to obviate the need to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change; and (iii) following the end of the Notice of Change
Period, the Company Board has determined, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, taking into account any changes to this
Agreement proposed in writing by Parent in response to the Notice of Change of
Recommendation or otherwise, that (A) the Superior Proposal giving rise to the
Notice of Change of Recommendation continues to constitute a Superior Proposal
or (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board
to effect an Adverse Recommendation ​

Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors'
duties under applicable Law.

(g)Any amendment to the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing
of payment of consideration) or any other material amendment of such a
Superior Proposal will require a new Notice of Change of Recommendation, and
the Company will be required to comply again with the requirements of _Section
6.6(f)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , the Notice of Change Period will be reduced
to two Business Days following receipt by Parent of any such new Notice of
Change of Recommendation.

(h)Nothing contained in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i)
taking and disclosing to the Company's stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the
Company that is required by applicable Law or if the Company Board determines,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make
such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors' duties under applicable Law (for the avoidance of doubt, it being
agreed that the issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a "stop, look
and listen" or similar statement of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act will not constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change); _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor
the Company Board will be permitted to recommend that the stockholders of the
Company tender any securities in connection with any tender offer or exchange
offer that is a Company Acquisition Proposal or otherwise effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect thereto, except as permitted by _Section
6.6(e)_.

(i)Except as it may relate to any Excluded Party and subject to the other
provisions of this _Section 6.6_ , from and after the No-Shop Period Start
Date until the earlier of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article VIII_ and the Company Merger Effective Time: (i) the Company shall
not, and shall not permit any Company Subsidiary to, terminate, waive, amend
or modify any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, except solely to allow
the applicable party to make a non-public Company Acquisition Proposal to the
Company Board; and (ii) the Company and the Company Board shall not take any
actions to exempt any person from the "Stock Ownership Limit" or establish or
increase an "Excepted Holder Limit," as such terms are defined in the Company
Charter unless such actions are taken concurrently with the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(c)(i)_.

(j)The Company agrees that it will promptly instruct its and the Company
Subsidiaries' respective Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this
_Section 6.6_.

Section 6.7 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement or the Mergers and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior
consent of the other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party (or their
respective affiliates) may, without the prior consent of the other Parties,
issue such press release or make such public statement (a) as may be required
by applicable Law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange or quotation
system if the Party issuing such press release or making such public statement
has provided the other Parties with an opportunity to review and comment (and
the Parties shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such press
release or public statement) upon any such press release or public statement
or (b) containing statements with ​

respect to this Agreement or the Mergers that are substantially similar to
those in the Proxy Statement or in previous press releases or public
statements made by the Company or Parent in accordance with this _Section 6.7_
; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such consultation or consent will be
required with respect to any release, communication, announcement or public
statement in connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change made in
accordance with this Agreement.

Section 6.8 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification_.

(a)From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Company and the Surviving OC to, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current
or former director or officer of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and each fiduciary under benefit plans of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries (each, an " **Indemnified Party** ") against (i) all
losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses),
judgments, fines, claims, actions, suits, damages or liabilities or, subject
to the proviso of the next sentence, amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (and whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Company Merger Effective Time),
including in connection with the consideration, negotiation and approval of
this Agreement, to the extent that they are based on or arise out of the fact
that such person is or was a director, officer or fiduciary under benefit
plans, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party
of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement
(the " **Indemnified Liabilities** "), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to
the extent they are based on or arise out of or pertain to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Company Merger Effective Time, and including any expenses incurred
in enforcing such person's rights under this _Section 6.8_ ; _provided_ , that
(A) none of the Surviving Company or the Surviving OC shall be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent (which may not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (B) except for legal
counsel engaged for one or more Indemnified Parties on the date hereof, none
of the Surviving Company or the Surviving OC shall be obligated under this
_Section 6.8(a)_ to pay the fees and expenses of more than one legal counsel
(selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all
Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single legal
action except to the extent that, on the advice of any such Indemnified
Party's counsel, two or more of such Indemnified Parties shall have
conflicting interests in the outcome of such action. In the event of any such
loss, expense, claim, damage or liability (whether or not asserted before the
Company Merger Effective Time), the Surviving Company or the Surviving OC, as
applicable, shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by
the Indemnified Parties promptly after statements therefor are received and
otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request, reimbursement of
documented expenses reasonably incurred ( _provided_ that, if legally
required, the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advance if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is not legally entitled
to indemnification under applicable Law).

(b)Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and
fully pay the premium for, and Surviving Company shall cause to be maintained
in full force and effect (and the obligations under to be honored) during the
six-year period beginning on the date of the Company Merger Effective Time, a
"tail" prepaid insurance policy or policies on terms and conditions no less
advantageous than the Company's officers' and directors' liability insurance
policies in effect on the date hereof (accurate and complete copies of which
have been previously provided to Parent); _provided_ that in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Company be required ​

to pay annual premiums in the aggregate of more than an amount equal to 300%
of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the "
**Maximum Amount** ") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant to
this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ that if the amount of the annual
premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the
Maximum Amount, Parent and the Surviving Company shall procure and maintain
for such six-year period the most advantageous policies as can be reasonably
obtained for the Maximum Amount.

(c)The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this _Section
6.8_ will survive the Closing and the consummation of the Mergers and will not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 6.8_ applies (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 6.8_ applies will be
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.8_ , each of whom (including his
or her heirs, executors or administrators and his or her Representatives,
successors and assigns) may enforce the provisions of this _Section 6.8)_
without the consent of the Indemnified Party (including the successors,
assigns and heirs of such Indemnified Party) affected thereby. In the event
that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers
or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person,
or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Company, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Company shall assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.8_.

(d)For a period of six years from the Company Merger Effective Time, the
Surviving Company and the Surviving OC shall provide to the Indemnified
Parties the same rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses as provided to the Indemnified Parties under the provisions of the
Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' declaration of trust, charter, bylaws
or similar organizational documents as in effect as of the date hereof, and
the Surviving Company's and the Surviving OC's declaration of trust, charter,
bylaws or similar organizational documents will not contain any provisions
inconsistent with such rights. The contractual indemnification rights set
forth in _Section 6.8(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter in existence on the
date of this Agreement with any of the current or former directors, officers
or employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary will be assumed by the
Surviving Company and the Surviving OC without any further action, and will
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms following the
Company Merger Effective Time.

(e)The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement,
including this _Section 6.8_ , is intended to, will be construed to or will
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company, any Company Subsidiaries or the Indemnified Parties, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section
6.8_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such
policies.

Section 6.9 _Employee Matters_.

(a)From and after the Company Merger Effective Time and for the period ending
on the first anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time (or, if shorter,
during any applicable period of employment), Parent shall provide or cause its
Subsidiaries to provide, to each individual who was employed by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary as of ​

immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (each, a " **Company
Employee** "), (i) a base salary or wage rate, as applicable, that is no less
favorable than the base salary or wage rate in effect with respect to such
Company Employee immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, (ii)
an annual cash bonus opportunity that is no less favorable than the annual
cash bonus opportunity provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to
the Company Merger Effective Time and (iii) benefits (excluding equity-based
compensation, pension, retiree health and welfare benefits, severance,
retention, change in control and long-term incentive compensation) that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the benefits provided to such
Company Employee immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time.
Parent shall, or shall cause its designated Subsidiary to, assume and honor
the terms of the severance arrangements set forth in _Section 6.9(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, without amendment, in accordance with the terms of
_Section 6.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement requires that any Company Employee remain
employed for any period after Closing nor that any compensation or benefits be
provided after a Company Employee ceases to be employed (other than vested
rights and benefits in effect at the time of such cessation of employment and
the severance benefits set forth in _Section 6.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter). For the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries
providing any benefits to any Company Employee after the Company Merger
Effective Time (the " **Parent Plans** "), each Company Employee will be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors as if such service were with
Parent or an applicable Subsidiary for all purposes, including participation,
and vesting, provided that the foregoing will not apply for purposes of
benefit accrual under defined benefit plans, for purposes of any retiree
health plan, or to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits or to the extent the Company did not provide such
service credit under any comparable plan, program or benefit.

(b)Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (as the case may be) to, use
commercially reasonable efforts, to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions, actively at work requirements, waiting
periods or any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full
participation under the health and welfare plans of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries applicable to such Company Employee with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable to all Company Employees and their
dependents under any Parent Plan that is a welfare plan that such Company
Employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date, other than
limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements, waiting periods or
other restrictions that are already in effect with respect to such employees
and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date under any Company
Employee Benefit Plan, (ii) waive any and all evidence of insurability
requirements with respect to such Company Employees to the extent such
evidence of insurability requirements were not applicable to the Company
Employees under the comparable Company Employee Benefit Plans immediately
prior to the Closing, and (iii) provide each such Company Employee and his or
her dependents with full credit for any co-payments and deductibles satisfied
prior to the Closing Date for the plan year of the applicable Company Employee
Benefit Plan within which the Company Merger Effective Time occurs in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements, and for
any lifetime maximums, under any welfare plans that such employees are
eligible to participate in after the Closing Date. Prior to making any
material written communications to the Company Employees pertaining to
compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy
of the intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time
to review and comment on the communication (provided that Parent shall review
and comment promptly), and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing
any such mutually agreeable communication. ​

(c)Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.5_ , no provision of this
_Section 6.9_ , express or implied, (i) is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person
(including any Company Employee and any dependent or beneficiary thereof)
other than the Parties and their respective successors and assigns, (ii) will
constitute an amendment of, or an undertaking to amend, any Company Employee
Benefit Plan or any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) is intended to prevent Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any Company Employee
Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms or terminating the employment of any
Company Employee.

Section 6.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a)The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication received by
such Party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b)The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, if (i) any representation or warranty made by it
contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that the
applicable closing conditions would reasonably be expected to be incapable of
being satisfied by the Outside Date or (ii) it fails to comply with or satisfy
in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such notification will affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties
under this Agreement and will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice.

Section 6.11 _Dividends_. During the Interim Period, except as expressly
permitted pursuant to _Section 6.1(c)_ , neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary that is a REIT shall make distributions to its stockholders nor
shall the Operating Company make distributions to the Company expect with the
prior written consent of Parent.

Section 6.12 _Taxes_.

(a) _Mitigation of Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall, upon written request,
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary
to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with
respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement).

(b) _Tax Returns_. The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
timely file or cause to be timely filed (including applicable extensions) all
Tax Returns for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries required to be filed
on or prior to the Closing Date, and the Company shall pay or cause to be paid
all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. Any such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner materially consistent with the historical Tax accounting
practices of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (except as may be
required under applicable Tax Law). The Company shall provide to Parent copies
of any such Tax Return at least five days prior to the due date of such Tax
Return. ​

(c) _Withholding Forms_. On the Closing Date, prior to the Company Merger, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a duly executed certificate, dated as of the
Closing Date, that the Company has been a "domestically controlled qualified
investment entity" within the meaning of Section 897(h)(4)(B) of the Code
during its entire existence, and therefore the Company Shares, the Company
Series A Preferred Shares and the Company Series B Preferred Shares are not
"United States real property interests." The Operating Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to the Parent OP on the
Closing Date, prior to the Operating Company Merger, duly executed IRS Forms
W-9 from each holder of Operating Company Units (other than the Company or any
Company Subsidiary).

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
value added, stock transfer, stamp or similar Taxes, and any transfer,
recording, registration and other similar fees that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" **Transfer
Taxes** "). From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving

including conditions relating to (A) the availability or funding of the Equity
Financing, (B) the failure by Parent or any of its affiliates to deliver

between or among any parties to the Equity Commitment Letter, (ii) the receipt
of any written or electronic notice or other communication from any Person
providing the Equity Financing with respect to (A) any actual or potential
breach, default, termination, failure of condition, or repudiation by any
party to the Equity Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to
the Equity Financing of any provisions of the Equity Commitment Letter or any
definitive document related to the Equity Financing (or any statement by any
such Person that such Person does not intend to enter into any such document
or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby), or (B) any material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Equity Commitment
Letter or any definitive document related to the Equity Financing, and (iii)
the occurrence of any event or development that could reasonably be expected
to adversely impact the ability of Parent to obtain all or any portion of the
Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter on the terms and
conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated the Equity
Commitment Letter or the definitive documents related to the Equity Financing
(or if at any time for any other reason Parent believes that it will not be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Equity Financing contemplated by the
Equity Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from
the sources contemplated by any of the Equity Commitment Letter or the
definitive documents related to the Equity Financing). As soon as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within one Business Day) after the date on which
the Company delivers to Parent a written request, Parent will provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. Parent affirms that it is

assignment of, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Equity
Commitment Letter or any Definitive Equity Financing Agreement and will use
its best efforts to (A) maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letter until
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, and (B)
enforce its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter. Parent will not agree
to the withdrawal, repudiation, termination or rescission of any Alternative
Financing ​

Commitment Letter or any provision thereof. Any reference in this Agreement to
"Equity Financing" will include the financing contemplated by the Equity
Commitment Letter as amended or modified in compliance with this _Section
6.14(c)_ , and "Equity Commitment Letter" will include such document as
amended or modified in compliance with this _Section 6.14(c)_.

Parent shall not (i) split, combine or reclassify any of the equity interests
of Parent; (ii) sell or otherwise transfer, directly or indirectly, any of its

(a)Prior to the Closing, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Representatives to provide, in each case at Parent's sole expense, such
cooperation as may reasonably be requested by Parent that is customary and
necessary in connection with arranging and obtaining the (x) Equity Financing
and (y) Debt Financing and/or Additional Equity Financing (collectively, the "
**Alternative Financing** "; together with the Equity Financing, the "

agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by an Alternative
Financing Commitment Letter (the " **Definitive Debt Financing Agreements** ";
and together with the Definitive Equity Financing Agreements, the "
**Definitive Financing Agreements** "), subject to the occurrence of the
Closing, including executing an amendment, an amendment and restatement,
waiver or consent under the Company's existing credit facility such that the
Company's existing credit facility remains in place and is available upon the
Closing and upon the consummation of the Mergers and transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the immediately foregoing sentence, (A)
Parent will ensure that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing business or operations of the Company (it being
understood and agreed that the Company will not be required to take any action
that unreasonably interferes with its ongoing business or operations); (B)
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary will be required to commit to
take any action that (1) is not contingent upon the Closing (other than the
execution of an amendment, an amendment and restatement, waiver or consent
under the Company's existing credit facility such that the Company's existing
credit facility remains in place and is available upon the Closing and upon
the consummation of the Mergers and transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), (2) would be effective prior to the Closing, or (3) would encumber
any assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing; (C)
any information regarding the Company and any Company Subsidiary contained in
any materials in connection with the Financing shall be subject to the prior
review of the Company; and (D) neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor

liabilities directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by the Financing
Indemnitees in connection with any Financing, including any information

by, the Financing Indemnitees and their respective heirs, executors, estates,

condition to the Closing.

the implementation of a Superior Proposal (or by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_ in the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company (or
otherwise was attempting to be validly terminated by the Company) pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(i)_ in order to enter into a definitive agreement with an
Excluded Party providing for the implementation of a Superior Proposal).

(c)In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ , then the Company shall pay as directed by
Parent the Parent Expense Amount by wire transfer of same day funds to an
account designated by Parent within two Business Days after the date of such
termination by Parent or the Company.

(d)In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(i)_ , then the Company shall pay as directed by Parent the
Parent Expense Amount by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
designated by Parent within two Business Days after the date of such
termination by Parent; _provided_ that the payment by the Company of the
Parent Expense Amount pursuant to this _Section 8.3(d)_ shall not relieve the
Company of any obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)(iii)_ (but in the event such Company Termination Fee is or
becomes payable, such Company Termination Fee shall be reduced on a dollar for
dollar basis for the Parent Expense Amount actually paid to Parent pursuant to
this _Section 8.3(d)_ ).

(e)In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ , then Parent shall, within four
days after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to the
Company, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by the
Company, an amount equal to $32,000,000 (the " **Parent Termination Amount**
"); _provided_ that in the event Parent has not paid or caused to be paid to
the Company , by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by
the Company the Parent ​

Termination Amount within four days of such termination, then the Company may,
and is expressly authorized by Parent and its affiliates, to deduct from or
offset the Parent Termination Amount: _first_ against any dividends owed to
Parent or its affiliates that have been paid in-kind pursuant to the Series A
Articles Supplementary; _second_ against any dividends payable after the date
of this Agreement owed to Parent or its affiliates pursuant to the Series A
Articles Supplementary; and _in the alternative_ , in the event any of the
Company Series A Preferred Shares become redeemable pursuant to the Series A
Articles Supplementary, against the consideration owed to the holders of such
Company Series A Preferred Shares pursuant to such redemption. The Parties
agree that any amount so offset will be deemed paid (i.e., a cash inflow) for
purposes of computing the IRR (as defined in the Series A Articles
Supplementary), it being expressly agreed that any offset of any portion of
the Parent Termination Amount will not affect in a manner adverse to the
Company the computation of the Cumulative Cap (as defined in the Series A
Articles Supplementary).

(f)The Company and Parent agree that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that (i) neither the Company Termination Fee nor the Parent Expense Amount
is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent and the Parent OP in the circumstances in which the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expense Amount, as applicable, is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Mergers, which amount would otherwise
be impossible to calculate with precision and (ii) the Parent Termination
Amount is not a penalty, but rather is the amount that Parent has agreed to
pay the Company, upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Parent's
breach or other failure to consummate the Mergers pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ , for release from its agreement and
settlement of its obligation to consummate the Mergers in accordance herewith
and compensates the Company for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Mergers. In
the event that Parent or the Company, as the case may be, is required to
commence litigation to seek all or a portion of the amounts payable under this
_Section 8.3_ , and it prevails in such litigation, it will be entitled to
receive, in addition to all amounts that it is otherwise entitled to receive
under this _Section 8.3_ , all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees)
which it has incurred in enforcing its rights hereunder. The Parties agree
that in no event will (A) Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination
Amount on more than one occasion or (B) the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expense Amount on more than one
occasion.

(g)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, but subject to _Section 9.7_ ,
each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the Company's right to
terminate this Agreement and to receive payment of the Parent Termination
Amount pursuant to _Section 8.3(e)_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company, the Operating Company and any of their respective
former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders,
equityholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents or
affiliates (collectively, the " **Company Related Parties** ") against Parent,
Parent OP, any source of Debt Financing and any of their respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, equityholders,
members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates
(collectively, the " **Parent Related Parties** ") for all losses and damages
in respect of this Agreement, any breach of any covenant or agreement or
otherwise in respect of this Agreement, or the failure to consummate the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and upon
payment of the Parent Termination Amount to the Company, none of the Parent
Related Parties shall have any further liability to any of the Company Related
Parties ​

relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and no Company Related Party shall
seek to recover any other damages or seek any other remedy, whether based on a
claim at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, with respect to any
losses or damages suffered in connection with this Agreement the Financing or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement but subject to _Section 9.7_ , in no event shall any of the
Parent Related Parties be subject to (and no Company Related Party shall seek
to recover) monetary damages or other payments whatsoever (including multiple,
consequential, indirect, special, statutory, exemplary or punitive damages) in
excess of an amount equal to the Parent Termination Amount for any losses or
other liabilities arising out of or in connection with breaches by Parent or
Parent OP of their representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement.

(h)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, but subject to _Section 9.7_ ,
each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that Parent's right to terminate
this Agreement and to receive payment of the Company Termination Amount or the
Parent Expense Amount pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ , as applicable, shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against
the Company Related Parties for all losses and damages in respect of this
Agreement, any breach of any covenant or agreement or otherwise in respect of
this Agreement, or the failure to consummate the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and upon payment of the Company
Termination Amount or the Parent Expense Amount to Parent, as applicable, none
of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability to any of the
Parent Related Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and no Parent
Related Party shall seek to recover any other damages or seek any other
remedy, whether based on a claim at law or in equity, in contract, tort or
otherwise, with respect to any losses or damages suffered in connection with
this Agreement the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement but subject to _Section
9.7_ , in no event shall any of the Company Related Parties be subject to (and
no Parent Related Party shall seek to recover) monetary damages or other
payments whatsoever (including multiple, consequential, indirect, special,
statutory, exemplary or punitive damages) in excess of an amount equal to the
Company Termination Amount or the Parent Expense Amount, as applicable, for
any losses or other liabilities arising out of or in connection with breaches
by the Company or the Operating Company of their representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement.

(i)While the Company or Parent, as applicable, may pursue both a grant of
specific performance or other equitable relief under _Section 9.7_ and,
following termination of this Agreement, the payment of the Parent Termination
Amount, the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expense Amount, as
applicable, under no circumstances shall the Company or Parent be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance or other equitable
relief and any money damages (including the Parent Termination Amount, the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expense Amount, as applicable) in
connection with this Agreement or any termination of this Agreement.

(j) _Limitations on Payment_. The following provisions apply in the event
Parent elects to pay the Parent Termination Amount in cash pursuant to
_Section 8.3(e)_.

(i)In the event that Parent is obligated to pay the Parent Termination Amount,
the amount payable to the Company in any Tax year of the Company will not
exceed the lesser of (i) the Parent Termination Amount and (ii) the sum of (A)
the maximum amount that can be paid to the Company without causing the Company
to fail to meet the requirements of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for
the relevant Tax year, determined as if the payment of ​

such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or
856(c)(3) of the Code (" **Qualifying Income** ") and the Company has income
from unknown sources during such year in an amount equal to 1% of its gross
income which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated
income which is not Qualifying Income), in each case, as determined by the
Company's independent accountants, plus (B) in the event the Company receives
either (1) a letter from the Company's counsel indicating that the Company has
received a ruling from the IRS as described below in this _Section 8.3(j)_ or
(2) an opinion from the Company's outside counsel as described below in this
_Section 8.3(j)_ , an amount equal to the excess of the Parent Termination
Amount, less the total amount paid under clause (A) above.

(ii)To secure Parent's obligation to pay the Parent Termination Amount, Parent
shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Parent Termination
Amount with an escrow agent selected by Parent on such terms (subject to this
_Section 8.3(j)_ ) as shall be mutually agreed upon by Parent, the Company and
the escrow agent. The deposit into escrow of the Parent Termination Amount
pursuant to this _Section 8.3(j)_ will be made at the time Parent is obligated
to pay the Company such amount pursuant to _Section 8.3_ by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. The escrow agreement will provide that the Parent
Termination Amount in escrow or any portion thereof will not be released to
the Company unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the
following: (i) a letter from the Company's independent accountants indicating
the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Company without
causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and
(3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
Qualifying Income and the Company has income from unknown sources during such
year in an amount equal to 1% of its gross income which is not Qualifying
Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying
Income), in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the
Company, or (ii) a letter from the Company's counsel indicating that (A) the
Company received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Company
of the Parent Termination Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or
would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code or (B) the Company's outside counsel has rendered a legal
opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Company of the Parent
Termination Amount should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the
Parent Termination Amount to the Company. Parent agrees to amend this _Section
8.3(j)_ at the reasonable request of the Company in order to (i) maximize the
portion of the Parent Termination Amount that may be distributed to the
Company hereunder without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (ii) improve the Company's chances
of securing a favorable ruling described in this _Section 8.3(j)_ or (iii)
assist the Company in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside
counsel as described in this _Section 8.3(j)_. Any amount of the Parent
Termination Amount that remains unpaid as of the end of a Taxable year will be
paid as soon as possible during the following Taxable year, subject to the
foregoing limitations of this _Section 8.3(j)_ ; _provided_ , that the
obligation of Parent to pay the unpaid portion of the Parent Termination
Amount will terminate on the December 31 following the date which is five
years from the date of this Agreement. Any costs and expenses of the escrow
agent shall be borne solely by the Company. ​

Section 9.4 _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a)This Agreement and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of
this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby will be governed by

with respect to issues relating to the Operating Company Merger that are
required to be governed by the DLLCA or the DRULPA), in each case without
regard to its rules of conflict of laws.

(b)Each of the Parties hereby (i) irrevocably submits to and agrees to be
subject to the personal jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City,
Maryland and/or the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (the "

the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, (ii)
irrevocably agrees that all such claims, actions, suits or proceedings may and
will be brought before, and determined by, only a Chosen Court with subject
matter jurisdiction over such claim(s), action(s), suit(s) or proceeding(s),

suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in any court other than a Chosen Court. In any judicial
proceeding, each of the Parties further consents to the assignment of any
proceeding in the Courts of the State of Maryland to the Business and
Technology Case Management Program pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-205 (or any
successor thereof).

(c)Each of the Parties irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and
complaint and any other process in any other claim, suit, action or proceeding
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of
itself or its property, in the manner provided by _Section 9.3_ , and nothing

process in any other manner permitted by Law.

(d)Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any claim, suit, action or
proceeding will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

(e)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Party agrees that it

(f)EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE DEBT
FINANCING) IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
(INCLUDING THE DEBT FINANCING), OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 9.4(F)_. ​

Section 9.5 _Parties In Interest_.

(a)This Agreement will be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
Party and its successors and permitted assigns, and, except as provided in
_Section 6.8_ and _Section 6.15(b)_ , nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or will confer upon any other Person any rights,
benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties
set forth in this Agreement. The Parties further agree that the rights of
third party beneficiaries under _Section 6.8_ and _Section 6.15(b)_ will not
arise unless and until the Company Merger Effective Time occurs. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties may be subject to
waiver by the Parties in accordance with _Section 9.9_ without notice or
liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of
the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

(b)Notwithstanding _Section 9.5(a)_ , each Debt Financing Source will be an
express third party beneficiary with respect to the definition of "Debt
Financing Source", _Section 8.3(e)_ , _Section 9.2(b)_ , _Section 9.4(e)_ ,
_Section 9.4(f)_ , this _Section 9.5(b)_ , _Section 9.8_ , _Section 9.9_ and
_Section 9.11(b)_ (or any other provision of this Agreement to the extent such
modification, waiver or termination would modify in any material respect the
substance of such Sections or such definition) (the " **DFS Provisions** ").
The DFS Provisions will, with respect to the matters referenced therein,
supersede any provision of this Agreement to the contrary. The DFS Provisions
will survive any termination of this Agreement.

Section 9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement will
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.

Section 9.7 _Specific Performance_.

(a)The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, including if the Parties fail to
take any action required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and, more specifically, that irreparable
damage would occur if the Mergers were not consummated, including the Parties'
obligations to consummate the Mergers and the obligation of Parent to pay, and
the rights of the holders of Company Shares, the holders of Operating Company
Units, the holders of Company Series A Preferred Shares and the holders of
Company Series B Preferred Shares to receive, the Merger Consideration, the
Operating Company Merger Consideration, the Series A Preferred Merger
Consideration and the Series B Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable,
pursuant to the Mergers, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement), and that monetary ​

damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is
accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Article VIII_ , the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, without proof of damages or otherwise (including
the Parties' obligations to consummate the Mergers and the obligation of
Parent to pay, and the rights of the holders of Company Shares, the holders of
the Operating Company Units, the holders of Company Series A Preferred Shares
and the holders of Company Series B Preferred Shares to receive, the Merger
Consideration, the Operating Company Merger Consideration, the Series A
Preferred Merger Consideration and the Series B Preferred Merger
Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to the Mergers, on the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement) in the Chosen Courts, and each
Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each Party agrees that the right
of specific performance and other equitable relief is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right neither the
Company, the Operating Company, Parent nor the Parent OP would have entered
into this Agreement. The Parties agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the Parties otherwise have an
adequate remedy at law.

(b)The parties further agree (i) the seeking of remedies pursuant to _Section
9.7(a)_ will not in any respect constitute a waiver by any of the Company, the
Operating Company, Parent or the Parent OP seeking such remedies of its
respective right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to it
under this Agreement, including under _Section 8.3_ in the event that the
remedies provided for in _Section 9.7(a)_ are not available or otherwise not
granted and (ii) nothing set forth in this Agreement will require the Company,
the Operating Company, Parent or the Parent OP to institute any proceeding for
(or limit any of the Company's, the Operating Company's, Parent's or the
Parent OP's right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under
this _Section 9.7_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under _Article VIII_ , nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding by
any of Parent or the Parent OP seeking remedies pursuant to _Section 9.7(a)_
or anything set forth in this _Section 9.7_ restrict or limit Parent's right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VIII_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

(c)The Company will be entitled to specific performance (or other injunctive
or equitable relief pursuant to _Section 9.7(a)_ ) to cause Parent to draw
down on the full proceeds of the Equity Commitment Letter and to cause Parent
to effect the Closing in accordance with _Section 2.3_ , in each case, only if
(i) all conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing; _provided_ that such
conditions to be satisfied at the Closing would be satisfied as of the date of
such notice if the Closing were to occur on the date of such notice) have been
satisfied or validly waived and (ii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in
writing that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing is
funded, then the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.3_ will occur; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Company receives a grant of specific performance
pursuant to this _Section 9.7(c)_ and the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.3_
occurs, then the Company will be deemed to have waived any and all rights to
pursue and recover all or any portion of the Parent Termination Amount
pursuant to _Section 8.3(e)_ and any other remedy as a matter of Law,
Contract, tort, equity or otherwise (for money damages or otherwise) upon such
receipt of specific performance, other than any expenses and costs incurred in
enforcing its rights under this Agreement. ​

Section 9.8 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by the
Company, the Operating Company, Parent and the Parent OP at any time before or
after approval of the Mergers by the Company Requisite Vote but, after such
approval, no amendment will be made which requires the approval of any such
stockholders under applicable Law without obtaining such further approvals.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of all of the Parties. No DFS Provision may be amended or modified in a
manner materially adverse to the Debt Financing Sources without the consent of
the Debt Financing Sources (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

Section 9.9 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, each
Party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any breaches or inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other Parties contained in this
Agreement or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or (c) subject to _Section 9.8_ , waive compliance by the other
Parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement.
Any agreement on the part of any Party to any such extension or waiver will be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party or
Parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by the Company, the Operating Company, Parent or the Parent OP in
exercising any right hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of
any other right hereunder. No DFS Provision may be waived in a manner
materially adverse to the Debt Financing Sources without the consent of the
Debt Financing Sources (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed)

Section 9.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed will be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together will be considered one and the same agreement. The exchange of a
fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by
electronic delivery in .pdf format will be sufficient to bind the Parties to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Section 9.11 _Non-Recourse_.

(a)Each Party agrees, on behalf of itself and its affiliates, that any suit,

 _Tax Status of Jernigan Capital, Inc._ 

---|--- 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as U.S. federal income tax counsel to Jernigan Capital, Inc., a
Maryland Corporation (the " **Company** "), and Jernigan Capital Operating
Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " **Operating
Company** "), in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
August 3, 2020 (the " **Merger Agreement** "), between the Company, Jernigan
Capital Operating Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, NexPoint
RE Merger, Inc., a Maryland corporation (" **NexPoint RE** ")and NexPoint RE
Merger OP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" **NexPoint OP** ," and
collectively with NexPoint RE, " **NexPoint** "). Under Section 7.2(c) of the
Merger Agreement, NexPoint has requested your opinion as to the qualification
of the Company as a real estate investment trust (" **REIT** ") under
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " **Code**
"). You have requested our opinion with respect to the classification of the
Company as a REIT under the Code.

 _INFORMATION AND ASSUMPTIONS RELIED UPON_

In rendering the opinion expressed herein, we have examined such documents as
we have deemed appropriate, including (but not limited to) (1) the analyses of
qualifying income and assets prepared by the Company, and (2) stock ownership
information provided by the Company. In our examination of such documents, we
have assumed, with your consent, that all documents submitted to us are
authentic originals, or if submitted as photocopies or facsimile copies, that
they faithfully reproduce the originals thereof, that all such documents have
been or will be duly executed to the extent required, that all representations
and statements set forth in such documents are true and correct, and that all
obligations imposed by any such documents on the parties thereto have been or
will be performed or satisfied in accordance with their terms.

We have also obtained such additional information and representations as we
have deemed relevant and necessary through consultation with officers of the
Company, including representations made to us in the attached officer's
certificate from the Company (the " **Officer 's Certificate**"). We have
assumed, with your consent, that the representations set forth in the
Officer's Certificate are true, accurate, and complete as of the date hereof,
and that any representation made in any of the documents referred to therein
"to the knowledge and belief" of any person (or with similar qualification) is true and correct without such
qualification. While we have discussed such representations with
representatives of the Company, we have not conducted an independent
investigation or audit of such representations.

 _OPINION_

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that commencing
with the taxable year of the Company ended December 31, 2015, the Company has
been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and
taxation as a REIT under the Code, and its actual method of operation through
the date of this opinion has allowed, and its proposed method of operation
will allow, it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a
REIT.

The opinion expressed herein is given as of the date hereof and is based upon
the Code, the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, current
administrative positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the " **IRS**
"), and existing judicial decisions, any of which could be changed at any
time, possibly on a retroactive basis. Any such changes could adversely affect
the opinion rendered herein. In addition, as noted above, our opinion is based
solely on the documents that we have examined, the additional information that
we have obtained, and the representations that have been made to us, and
cannot be relied upon if any of the facts contained in such documents or in
such additional information is, or later becomes, inaccurate or if any of the
representations made to us is, or later becomes, inaccurate. We are not aware,
however, of any facts or circumstances contrary to or inconsistent with the
information, assumptions, and representations upon which we have relied for
purposes of this opinion. Our opinion is not binding on the IRS or any court.
Accordingly, no complete assurance can be given that the IRS will not
challenge our opinion or that a court will not agree with the IRS.

Finally, our opinion is limited to the tax matters specifically covered
herein, and we have not been asked to address, nor have we addressed, any
other tax consequences to the Company, the Operating Company, or any other
person.

This opinion is furnished by us to NexPoint in connection with the Merger
Agreement. This opinion may not be furnished to or relied upon by any other
person or entity, other than NexPoint for any purpose without our prior
written consent.
