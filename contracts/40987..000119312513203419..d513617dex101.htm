---|---|--- 



     | (i) | each resignation given under clause 7.3(b) is accepted;

clause 7.3(a)(i) and which form part of the Third Party Documents referred to
in clause 7.3(a)(iii) are approved for registration (subject only to the
payment of any applicable Stamp Duty). 
---|---|--- 



   7.6 | Performance of Completion obligations 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Subject to clause 7.6(c), the obligations of the parties
under clauses 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 are interdependent and no party is obliged to
complete the sale and purchase of the AOF Shares and Completion will not
occur unless all of the obligations of the other parties which are to be
performed under these clauses are performed as nearly as possible
simultaneously, on the same date and in accordance with the terms of this
deed. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | If for any reason Completion does not occur then, without
prejudice to any other rights of the parties, any action taken by the parties
under this clause 7 is deemed not to have occurred and the parties must take
all action necessary to restore them to their respective positions before such
action was taken, including returning any document delivered or payment made
to the party that delivered it or paid it.  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | GPC Australia may in its sole discretion waive the
performance of any of the obligations of AOF Beta under this clause 7 and AOF
Beta may in its sole discretion waive the performance of any of the
obligations of GPC Australia under this clause 7. 
---|---|--- 



   7.7 | Notice to complete 
---|--- 

If Completion does not occur in accordance with this clause 7 because of the
failure of any party (Defaulting Party) to satisfy any of its obligations
under this clause 7 then:

 



     | (a) | GPC Australia (where the Defaulting Party is AOF Beta); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | AOF Beta (where the Defaulting Party is GPC Australia), 
---|---|--- 

(in either case the Non-Defaulting Party) may give the Defaulting Party a
notice requiring the Defaulting Party to satisfy those obligations within a
period of 5 Business Days after the date of the notice and specifying that
time is of the essence in relation to that notice.

Despite anything else in this deed, if and when Completion occurs following a
notice given to AOF Beta by GPC Australia under this clause 7.7, "Actual Net
Debt" (and all terms used in the calculation of it) is to be calculated as
though Completion occurs on, and the Completion Date is, the date determined
for Completion under clause 7.1.



   7.8 | Remedies for failure to comply with notice 
---|--- 

If the Defaulting Party fails to comply with a notice given under clause 7.7,
the Non-Defaulting Party may without limiting its other rights or remedies
available under this deed or at law: 



     | (a) | immediately terminate this deed, in which case the Non-
Defaulting Party may seek damages for breach of this deed; or 
---|---|--- 
 



19 ---|---|--- 



     | (i) | if specific performance is obtained the Non-Defaulting Party
may also seek damages for breach of this deed; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | if specific performance is not obtained the Non-Defaulting
Party may then terminate this deed and may seek damages for breach of this
deed; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | enforce its rights under clause 7.9. 
---|---|---

appoints any two directors of GPCs Guarantor jointly as its attorney (the

any location outside of Australia (but not from any location within Australia)
such documents for and on its behalf as the Attorney thinks necessary or
desirable to give effect to any of the transactions or matters contemplated
by clauses 7.3(a)(i) and 7.3(a)(iv), including the power for the Attorney to
execute all necessary documentation to complete any of the sales or
transactions contemplated by those clauses on behalf of AOF Beta.  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | An Attorney may only exercise the power of attorney under
this clause 7.9 if:

of a notice on AOF Beta under clause 7.7; and 
---|---|---

with all of their respective obligations under clauses 7.4 and 7.5. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Validity 
---|---|--- 

AOF Beta declares that all acts and things done by the Attorney in exercising
powers under this power of attorney will be as good and valid as if they had

exercising powers under this power of attorney provided the exercise is
consistent with the provisions of clause 7.



     | (c) | Irrevocable 
---|---|--- 

AOF Beta declares that this power of attorney is given for valuable
consideration and, subject to clause 7.9(g), is irrevocable.



     | (d) | Benefits

exercising their power as attorney under this clause 7.9 as a result of which
a benefit is conferred on the GPCs Guarantor.

 



20 ---|---|--- 
 

AOF Beta must not issue, sign or execute any power of attorney or other
instrument signed, executed or issued by or on behalf of AOF Beta at any time
prior to the second day of the month which immediately follows the month in
which the day on which the power of attorney in clause 7.9(a)(i) became
capable of exercise under clause 7.9(a)(ii) occurred, whether before or after
the date of this deed, conferring on persons other than the attorneys
appointed under this clause 7.9 (whether jointly or severally or jointly and
severally) rights which contradict or are inconsistent with some or all of the
rights contained in the power of attorney granted under this clause 7.9 (an
Inconsistent Instrument), and undertakes to immediately revoke any powers
given in such Inconsistent Instrument, which contradict or are inconsistent
with the powers granted under this power of attorney. If AOF Beta fails to
revoke an Inconsistent Instrument the Attorney is authorised to revoke the
powers given in the Inconsistent Instrument which contradict or are
inconsistent with the powers granted in this power of attorney.

 



     | (f) | Specific Performance 
---|---|--- 
 

Each party acknowledge that:



     | (i) | its obligations under this clause 7.9 may be of a special,
unique or invaluable nature such that an award of damages or an account of
profits may be inadequate to compensate the other party for a failure by it
to comply with this clause 7.9; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | it will have a right to seek an ex parte, interlocutory or
final injunction to prohibit or restrain each other party from any violation

---|---|--- 
 



     | (g) | Termination

deed.



     | (h) | Release

against AOF Beta and any of its Related Bodies Corporate and directors,
officers, employees, consultants, advisers, attorneys and agents (the AOF

---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | With effect from the time the power of attorney granted

or in connection with or concerning a Delay Claim commenced by any other
party or any Non-AOF Personnel. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | Where this clause 7.9(h) applies, it is not, and shall not
be represented or construed by any party as, an admission of liability or
wrongdoing on the part of any party to this deed or any other person or
entity. 
---|---|--- 



   8. | ACCESS TO RECORDS FOLLOWING COMPLETION 
---|--- 

Without limiting any other rights of access under this deed, for a period of 2
years after Completion GPC Australia must procure that each Group Company
makes available to AOF Beta on reasonable notice and at the cost of AOF Beta
all records and documents of that Group Company (in whatever form and
including all statutory books, trading and financial records, employee
records, tax assessments and returns and all related correspondence)
reasonably required by AOF Beta (or any other AOF Entity) for the purposes
of:



     | (a) | complying with its legal obligations or to enable it to
prepare accounts, tax returns and other statutory returns or fulfil any other
obligation relating wholly or partly to any period before Completion; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | defending any claim or proceeding (other than a claim or
proceeding brought by a member of the GPC Group), 
---|---|--- 
 

except where to do so would, in the reasonable opinion of the party required
to make available any such records or documents, be likely to result in a
waiver of privilege in relation to the particular records or documents sought.



   9. | RELEASE FROM GUARANTEES 
---|--- 



   9.1 | Release of Group Companies from guarantees 
---|--- 

AOF Beta and GPC Australia must use all reasonable endeavours to procure that
on Completion each Group Company is released from all guarantees and
indemnities given by that Group Company in respect of any liability or

Company arising out of or in connection with those guarantees and indemnities.

Each Warranty will remain in full force and effect after Completion and a
Claim is not limited to breaches identified prior to Completion.

---|--- 

If before Completion, the Company or AOF Beta becomes aware of any fact,
matter or circumstance which results in or, in the opinion of the board of
directors of the Company (acting reasonably and in good faith), is reasonably
likely to result in a breach of any Warranty, that would give rise to a Claim
of not less than $5 million if Completion were to occur, before Completion
that party must promptly provide to GPC Australia notice describing
that fact, matter or circumstance in reasonable detail (having regard to the
facts it is aware of) provided that nothing in this clause obliges AOF Beta or
the Company to make enquiries as to whether any fact, matter or circumstance
of that type has arisen.



   10.7 | Termination for breach of Warranty prior to Completion 
---|--- 

Without limiting any other rights of GPC Australia under this deed, if before
Completion GPC Australia becomes aware of any fact, matter or circumstance
which results in or is reasonably likely to result in a breach of a Warranty
that would give rise to a Claim of not less than $5 million if Completion were
to occur, then GPC Australia may give notice of the relevant fact, matter or
circumstance in accordance with clause 11.4 and require the Company and AOF
Beta to procure that the specified fact, matter or circumstance is remedied by
the earlier of 11.59pm on the date 20 Business Days after the date of the
notice and 8am on the Completion Date. If the specified fact, matter
or circumstance is not remedied to the reasonable satisfaction of GPC
Australia by that time, then GPC Australia may:

of a Claim will be treated as a pro-rata increase in the purchase price of

---|--- 



   11.1 | No small claims 
---|--- 

GPC Australia cannot make any Warranty Claim unless:



     | (a) | the amount of damages to which GPC Australia would be

---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | the aggregate amount of all damages to which GPC Australia
would be entitled in relation to all Claims properly made under this deed
exceeds $5 million, at which point AOF Beta is liable for the whole of that
amount and not merely the excess over $5 million. 
---|---|--- 



   11.2 | Cap on Claims 
---|--- 

The maximum aggregate liability of AOF Beta arising out of or in connection
with this deed or its subject matter (including any and all Warranty Claims

   11.3 | Time limit 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The liability of AOF Beta in respect of any and all Claims
terminates on the date which is 12 months after the Completion Date except in

---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The liability of AOF Beta in respect of any Claim will in
any event terminate if proceedings in respect of that Claim have not been
commenced within 6 months after notice of that Claim is given to AOF Beta in
accordance with this deed. 
---|---|--- 



   11.4 | Notice 
---|--- 



     | (a) | If GPC Australia becomes aware of a matter or circumstance
which may give rise to a Claim GPC Australia must give notice to AOF Beta
specifying the relevant facts and the nature of the Claim, and give an
estimate of the amount of the Claim (Claim Notice) no later than 20 Business
Days after GPC Australia first becomes aware of that fact, matter or
circumstance. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Failure to give a Claim Notice within the period specified
in clause 11.4(a) will not bar GPC Australia from making a Claim but AOF Beta
will not be liable for any increased Loss suffered by GPC Australia as a
result of not giving AOF Beta the Claim Notice within the time specified in
clause 11.4(a). 
---|---|--- 
 



24 ---|--- 

AOF Beta has no liability for any loss of profits, business, goodwill,
opportunity or chance, or for any indirect or special loss, any punitive or
aggravated damages or for loss or damage resulting from a breach of this deed
(including a breach of any Warranty):



     | (a) | which does not arise naturally or in the usual course of
things from that breach; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | which was not in the reasonable contemplation of all parties
on or before execution of this deed as a probable result of the relevant
breach. 
---|---|--- 
 



   11.6 | Mitigation 
---|--- 

Nothing in this deed prejudices or otherwise affects any obligations of a
party at common law concerning, or otherwise resulting in, the mitigation of
Loss by that party.



   11.7 | Right to remedy 
---|--- 

If the matter or circumstance giving rise to a Claim is capable of remedy:



     | (a) | GPC Australia must procure that AOF Beta is given a 20
Business Day period after receipt of the Claim Notice to remedy the relevant
matter or circumstance; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | GPC Australia must, without prejudice to GPC Australias
obligations under clause 11.6, provide, and must procure that each relevant
Group Company provides, all reasonable assistance to AOF Beta as AOF Beta
requests in writing to remedy the relevant matter or circumstance, provided
that: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | GPC Australia must provide AOF Beta with a written estimate
(prepared in good faith) of the aggregate amount of any out of pocket costs or
expenses (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any costs or expenses
attributable to management time) which it is reasonably likely to incur in the
provision of such assistance (the Estimate); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | GPC Australia is only required provide any assistance which
would result in it incurring any out of pocket costs or expenses (excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, any costs or expenses attributable to management
time) (Relevant Costs) if AOF Beta approves the provision of such assistance
in writing, in which case AOF Beta must reimburse GPC Australia for all
Relevant Costs actually incurred by GPC Australia (as evidenced by
appropriate invoices) in the provision of such assistance up to an amount not
exceeding the Estimate (or such greater amount as AOF Beta and GPC Australia
agree in writing). 
---|---|--- 
 



   11.8 | Subsequent recovery 
---|--- 

If AOF Beta makes a payment in respect of a Claim (the AOF Payment) and:



     | (a) | at any time after the making of such payment any Group
Company or GPC Australia receives any sum, other than the AOF Payment, which
would not have been received but for the matter or circumstance giving rise
to that Claim (the Third Party Sum); 
---|---|--- 
 



25 account in calculating the AOF Payment; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | the aggregate of the Third Party Sum and the AOF Payment
exceeds the amount required to compensate GPC Australia in full for the loss
or liability which gave rise to the Claim in question (such excess being the
Excess Recovery), 
---|---|--- 

GPC Australia must, promptly following receipt of the Third Party Sum by it
or the relevant Group Company, repay to AOF Beta an amount equal to the lesser
of the Excess Recovery and the AOF Payment.



   11.9 | Insurance 
---|--- 

Without prejudice to clause 11.6, if in respect of any matter which would
otherwise give rise to a Claim, any Group Company is entitled to claim under
any policy of insurance (or would have been so entitled had it maintained in
force its insurance cover current at Completion), the amount of the Claim is
taken to be reduced by the amount of insurance monies to which that Group
Company is or would have been entitled.



   11.10 | Independent limitations

construed independently of the others and is not limited by any other

   15. | GST 
---|--- 



   15.1 | Interpretation 
---|--- 

Words and expressions that are defined in the GST Law have the same meaning
when used in this clause 15. For the purposes of this clause 15, references to
GST payable and input tax credit entitlements of any entity include GST
payable by, and the input tax credit entitlements of, the representative
member of the GST group of which the entity is a member.



   15.2 | Consideration exclusive of GST 
---|--- 

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this deed, all amounts payable or
consideration to be provided under or in connection with this deed are
exclusive of GST (GST Exclusive Consideration). 



   15.3 | Payment of GST 
---|--- 

If GST is payable on any supply made under or in connection with this deed
the recipient must pay to the party that has made or will make the supply (the
Supplier), in addition to the GST Exclusive Consideration, an additional
amount equal to the GST payable on that supply (the Additional Amount). The
recipient must pay the Additional Amount without set-off, demand or deduction,
at the same time and in the same manner as any GST Exclusive Consideration for
that supply is required to be paid, except that the recipient is not required
to pay the Additional Amount unless and until the Supplier has issued a tax
invoice under clause 15.4.



   15.4 | Tax invoice 
---|--- 

For any supply to which clause 15.3 applies, the Supplier must issue a tax
invoice which complies with the GST Law.

 



29 ---|--- 

If any adjustment event occurs in respect of a supply to which clause 15.3
applies:



     | (a) | the Additional Amount paid or payable by the recipient must
be recalculated, taking into account any previous adjustments under this
clause 15.5, to reflect the occurrence of that adjustment event and the
Supplier or the recipient, as the case requires, must pay to the other the
amount required to reflect the recalculation of the Additional Amount; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | the Supplier must provide an adjustment note to the
recipient as soon as practicable after the Supplier becomes aware of the
occurrence of that adjustment event.  
---|---|--- 



   15.6 | Input tax credits 
---|--- 
 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this deed, if an amount payable under
or in connection with this deed is calculated by reference to any Loss
incurred or suffered by a party, then the amount payable must be reduced by
the amount of any input tax credit to which that entity is entitled in respect
of the acquisition of any supply to which the Loss relates.

---|---|--- 



     | (i) | an applicable law requires a party to this deed (Payer) to
deduct an amount (Deduction) from a payment under this deed (Payment) to
another party under this deed (Recipient); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | an Authority notifies a Payer that a Deduction is required
from a Payment not otherwise required by a law,

Authority in connection with, or relating to, the Deduction Obligation; and

B.V. there is one or more other sellers as a result of the operation of clause
1.8 of the Call Option Deed:

 



     | (a) | a reference to AOF Beta in this deed will be taken to
include a reference to each AOF Entity who is a seller (together, the AOF
Sellers and where applicable, each an AOF Seller); 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | all rights and liabilities of the AOF Sellers under and in
connection with this deed are several and not joint or joint and several; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | without limiting clause 20.1(a), where this deed requires a
payment to be made: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | to the AOF Sellers, the person making the payment must pay
each AOF Seller its Relevant Proportion of the payment; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | by the AOF Sellers, each AOF Seller must pay (and is not
liable for any amount exceeding) its Relevant Proportion of the payment; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | if an AOF Seller (Defaulting Seller) fails to perform any

the Defaulting Seller only; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | an AOF Seller alone is responsible for any breach of any
Warranty which relates to that AOF Seller. No AOF Seller is responsible for

   20.2 | Trustees 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Each of the AOF Sellers which is a trustee enters into this
deed only in its capacity as trustee of the relevant trust and in no other
capacity.  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | A liability arising under or in connection with this deed or
any other Sale Transaction Document (whether that liability arises under a
specific provision of this deed, or for breach of contract or otherwise) can
be enforced against an AOF Seller which is a trustee only to the extent to
which it can be satisfied out of the property of the relevant trust out of
which that AOF Seller is actually indemnified for the liability. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The limitation of the liability of each AOF Seller which is
a trustee under this clause 20.2: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | applies despite any other provision of this deed; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | extends to all liabilities and obligations of the relevant
trustee in relation to any representation, warranty, conduct, omission,
agreement or transaction related to this deed.

---|---|---

or affecting an AOF Seller which is a trustee. 
---|---|--- 
 

The provisions of this clause 20.2 will not apply to any obligation or
liability of an AOF Seller which is a trustee to the extent that it is not
satisfied because there is a reduction in the extent, or an extinguishment, of
that trustees indemnification out of the assets of the relevant trust, as a
result of that trustees fraud, gross negligence or breach of trust.
