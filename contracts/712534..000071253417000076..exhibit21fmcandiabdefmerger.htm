SECTION 3 

CONSIDERATION TO BE DISTRIBUTED

3.1 Consideration. Upon and by reason of the Merger becoming effective, the
shareholders of IALB of record on the Effective Date shall be entitled to
receive in exchange for the IALB common shares, without par value, ("IALB
Common Stock") held, 1.6530 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of First Merchants'
common stock ("First Merchants Common Stock"). The Exchange Ratio shall be
subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 3.3.

3.2 Fractional First Merchants Common Shares. Certificates for fractional
shares of First Merchants Common Stock shall not be issued in respect of
fractional interests arising from the Exchange Ratio. Each holder of IALB
Common Stock who would have otherwise been entitled to a fraction of a share
of First Merchants Common Stock, upon surrender of all such shareholder's
certificates representing IALB Common Stock, shall be paid in cash (without
interest), an amount rounded to the nearest whole cent, determined by
multiplying the First Merchants Average Price (as defined below) by the
fractional share of First Merchants Common Stock to which such holder of IALB
Common Stock would otherwise be entitled. No such holder of IALB Common Stock
shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or any other rights in respect
of any fractional share. The term "First Merchants Average Price" shall mean
the average closing price of a share of First Merchants Common Stock as
reported by Bloomberg, L.P. for the ten (10) days that First Merchants Common

shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted to reflect any share
adjustment as contemplated by Section 3.3 hereof.

3.3 Recapitalization. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Date, First Merchants issues a stock dividend with respect to its shares of
common stock, combines, subdivides, or splits 

up its outstanding shares or takes any similar recapitalization action, then
the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted so that each holder of IALB Common Stock
shall receive such number of shares of First Merchants Common Stock as
represents the same percentage of outstanding shares of First Merchants Common
Stock at the Effective Date as would have been represented by the number of
shares of First Merchants Common Stock such shareholder would have received if
the recapitalization had not occurred.

3.4 Distribution of First Merchants' Common Stock.

(a) Each share of common stock of First Merchants outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Date shall remain outstanding unaffected by the Merger.
Any shares of IALB Common Stock held by First Merchants shall be cancelled by
virtue of the Merger and not be exchanged for shares of First Merchants Common
Stock.

(b) On or prior to the Effective Date, First Merchants shall (i) authorize the
issuance of and shall make available to American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company, LLC or such other exchange agent selected by First Merchants (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the registered shareholders of IALB
Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Section 3, certificates for
shares (or book entry of shares) of First Merchants Common Stock (the "First
Merchants Stock Certificates") to be issued pursuant to Section 3.1, and (ii)
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent sufficient cash for payment of cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of First Merchants Common Stock in accordance
with Section 3.2. Such First Merchants Stock Certificates and cash are
referred to in this Section 3 as the "Exchange Fund." First Merchants shall be
solely responsible for the payment of any fees and expenses of the Exchange
Agent.

(c) Within three (3) business days following the Effective Date, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of IALB Common Stock a letter of transmittal
(the "Letter of Transmittal") providing (i) that delivery shall be effected
and risk of loss of title to the certificates representing IALB Common Stock
shall pass only upon delivery of the certificates to the Exchange Agent and
(ii) instructions as to the transmittal to the Exchange Agent of certificates
representing shares of IALB Common Stock and the issuance of shares of First
Merchants Common Stock in exchange therefor pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. Distribution of shares of First Merchants Common Stock Certificates
and cash payments in lieu of fractional shares shall be made by the Exchange
Agent to each former holder of IALB Common Stock within five (5) business days
following the later of the Effective Date or the date of such shareholder's
delivery to the Exchange Agent of such shareholder's certificates representing
IALB Common Stock, accompanied by a properly completed and executed Letter of
Transmittal. Interest shall not accrue or be payable with respect to any cash
payments.

(d) Following the Effective Date, stock certificates representing IALB Common
Stock shall be converted to, and deemed to evidence only the right to receive
such number of shares of First Merchants Common Stock as determined in
accordance with Sections 3.1 and 3.2 above (for all corporate purposes other
than the payment of dividends) and cash for fractional shares, as applicable.
No dividends or other distributions otherwise payable subsequent to the
Effective Date on shares of First Merchants Common Stock shall be paid to any
shareholder entitled to receive the same until such shareholder has
surrendered such shareholder's certificates for IALB Common Stock to the
Exchange Agent in exchange for First Merchants Common Stock. Upon surrender or
compliance with the provisions of Section 3.4(c), there shall be paid to the
record holder of First Merchants Common Stock the amount of all dividends and
other distributions, without interest thereon, withheld with respect to such
common stock. 

(e) From and after the Effective Date, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of IALB of any shares of IALB Common Stock.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
IALB Common Stock for twelve (12) months after the Effective Date shall be
paid, distributed, or otherwise released to First Merchants, or its successors
in interest. Any shareholders of IALB who have not theretofore complied with
this Section 3 shall thereafter look only to First Merchants, or its
successors in interest, for the issuance of shares of First Merchants Common
Stock and any unpaid dividends and distributions on First Merchants Common
Stock deliverable in respect of each share of IALB Common Stock such
shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of First Merchants, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of IALB Common Stock for any
amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) First Merchants shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of
IALB to establish the persons entitled to receive shares of First Merchants
Common Stock, which books, in the absence of actual knowledge by First
Merchants of any adverse claim thereto, shall be conclusive with respect to
the ownership of such stock.

(h) With respect to any certificate for IALB Common Stock which has been lost,
stolen, or destroyed, First Merchants shall be authorized to issue First
Merchants Common Stock to the registered owner of such certificate upon
receipt of an affidavit of lost stock certificate, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to First Merchants, and upon compliance by such
registered owner with all procedures historically required by IALB in
connection with lost, stolen, or destroyed certificates, with any costs
incurred at the shareholder's expense.

SECTION 4 

DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and
outstanding shares of IALB Common Stock held by a person (a "Dissenting
Shareholder") who has not voted in favor of, or consented to, the adoption of
this Agreement and has complied with all the provisions of the Indiana
Business Corporation Law concerning the rights of holders of shares of IALB
Common Stock to require payment of fair cash value of such IALB Common Stock
(the "Dissenting Shares"), in accordance with Indiana Code ยง 23-1-44, as
amended, shall not be converted into the right to receive such number of
shares of First Merchants Common Stock and cash for fractional shares as
determined in accordance with Sections 3.1 and 3.2 above (the "Merger
Consideration"), but shall become the right to receive such consideration as
may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Shareholder pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Indiana Code ยง 23-1-44, as amended. If such Dissenting
Shareholder withdraws its demand for fair cash value or fails to perfect or
otherwise loses its rights as a dissenting shareholder, in any case under the
Indiana Business Corporation Law, each of such Dissenting Shareholder's shares
of IALB Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as though such shares of IALB
Common Stock had been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.2. IALB shall notify First
Merchants of each shareholder who asserts rights as a Dissenting Shareholder
following receipt of such Shareholder's written demand delivered as provided
in Indiana Code ยง 23-1-44, as amended. Prior to the Effective Date, IALB shall
not, except with the prior written consent of First Merchants, voluntarily
make any payment, or settle or commit to settle or offer to settle any rights
of a Dissenting Shareholder asserted under Indiana Code ยง 23-1-44, as amended.

5.6 Accuracy of Statements. No information which has been or shall be supplied
by IALB with respect to its businesses, operations and financial condition for
inclusion in the proxy statement, registration statement, and regulatory
applications relating to the Merger or the Bank Merger contains or shall
contain (in the case of information relating to the proxy statement at the
time it is mailed and for the regulatory applications and registration
statement, and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, at the time it
becomes effective) any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or shall
omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained
therein not misleading.

5.7 Litigation and Pending Proceedings. Except as set forth in the IALB
Disclosure Letter, there are no claims of any kind, nor any action, suits,
proceedings, arbitrations or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of
IALB's Management, threatened in any court or before any government agency or
body, arbitration panel or otherwise (nor does IALB's Management have any
knowledge of a basis for any claim, action, suit, proceeding, arbitration or
investigation) which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. To the knowledge of IALB's Management, there are no uncured
violations, criticisms or exceptions, or violations with respect to which
refunds or restitutions may be required, cited in any report, correspondence
or other communication to IALB or any Subsidiary as a result of an examination
by any regulatory agency or body which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the unaudited consolidated
balance sheet for the twelve months 

ended December 31, 2016 and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders' equity and cash flows for the years or period then ended
(hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Financial Information") present
fairly the consolidated financial condition or position of IALB as of the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations of IALB

a mortgage securing such loans, are secured by perfected security interests or

adversely affect the value of any such loan and the recovery of payment on any
such loan if the Bank is not able to enforce any such security interest or
mortgage.

5.9 Absence of Certain Changes. Except for events and conditions relating to
the business and interest rate environment in general, the accrual or payment
of Merger-related expenses, or as set forth in the IALB Disclosure Letter,
since December 31, 2016, no events have occurred which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the IALB
Disclosure Letter, between the period from December 31, 2016 to the date of

businesses in the ordinary and usual course consistent with their past
practices (excluding the incurrence of fees and expenses of professional
advisors related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby)
and there has not been any declaration, setting aside or payment of any
dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with
respect to IALB's Common Stock (other than normal quarterly cash dividends) or
any split, combination or reclassification of any stock of IALB or any
Subsidiary or, with the exception of the issuance of shares in connection with
the exercise of stock options or the vesting of any performance stock units,

of, or in lieu of, or in substitution for IALB's or any Subsidiary's common
shares or equity interests, as applicable.

5.10 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth in the IALB
Disclosure Letter, neither IALB nor the Bank has any liabilities, whether
accrued, absolute, contingent, or otherwise, existing or arising out of any
transaction or state of facts existing on or prior to the date hereof, except
(a) as and to the extent disclosed, reflected or reserved against in the
Financial Information, (b) any agreement, contract, obligation, commitment,
arrangement, liability, lease or license which individually is less than Two
Hundred Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($250,000.00) per year and which may
be terminated within one year from the date of this Agreement, (c) liabilities
incurred since December 31, 2016 in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice that either alone or when considered with all similar
liabilities, have not had or would not reasonably be expected have a Material
Adverse Effect on IALB, (d) liabilities incurred for reasonable legal,
accounting, financial advising fees and out-of-pocket expenses or fees in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (e)
unfunded loan commitments made in the ordinary course of the Bank's business

5.11 Title to Assets.

(a) IALB and each Subsidiary have good and marketable title in fee simple
absolute to all personal property reflected in the December 31, 2016 Financial

contract all other property used in IALB's or any Subsidiary's business, and
good and marketable title to all property and assets acquired since December

security interests, charges, claims or encumbrances of any nature, except such
minor imperfections of title, if any, as do not materially detract from the
value of or interfere with the use of the property and which would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The operation by IALB or any Subsidiary of such properties and assets is
in material compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations of any governmental authority or third party having jurisdiction
over such use except for such noncompliance that would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.

5.12 Loans and Investments.

(a) Except as set forth in the IALB Disclosure Letter, there is no loan of the
Bank in excess of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($250,000.00)
that, as of December 31, 2016, that (i) has been classified by IALB, applying
applicable regulatory examination standards, as "Other Loans Specially
Mentioned," "Substandard," "Doubtful" or "Loss;" (ii) has been identified by
accountants or auditors (internal or external) as having a significant risk of
uncollectibility, or (iii) has been identified by IALB Management to be ninety
(90) days or more past due with respect to principal or interest or has placed

(b) The reserves for loan and lease losses and the carrying value for other
real estate owned which are shown on each of the balance sheets contained in
the Financial Information were adequate in the judgment of IALB's Management

charged off, on loans and leases outstanding and other real estate owned
(including accrued interest receivable) as of the applicable date of such

reflected in the Financial Information and none of the investments made by

set forth in the IALB Disclosure Letter, IALB or any Subsidiary is not a party
to any repurchase agreements with respect to securities.

5.13 Employee Benefit Plans.

contributed to by IALB, any Subsidiary or any other entity, trade or business
that, together with IALB, would be treated as a single employer under the
provisions of Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code ("IALB ERISA
Affiliate"), and covers any employee, director or former employee or director
of IALB, any Subsidiary or any IALB ERISA Affiliate under which IALB or any
IALB ERISA Affiliate has any liability. The IALB Disclosure Letter also
contains a list of all "employee benefit plans" as defined under ERISA which
have been terminated by IALB, any Subsidiary or any IALB ERISA Affiliate since
January 1, 2010. Copies of such plans (and, if applicable, related trust
agreements or insurance contracts) and all amendments thereto and written 

interpretations thereof have been furnished to First Merchants together with
the three (3) most recent annual reports (Form 5500) prepared in connection
with any such plan and the current summary plan descriptions (and any summary
of material modifications thereto). Such plans are hereinafter referred to
individually as an "Employee Plan" and collectively as the "Employee Plans."
The Employee Plans which individually or collectively would constitute an
"employee pension benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(2)(A) of ERISA are
identified as such in the list referred to above.

statutory or administrative exemption exists, and no "reportable event," as
defined in Section 4043(c) of ERISA, for which a notice is required to be
filed, has occurred with respect to any Employee Plan that could subject IALB
to material taxes or penalties. Neither IALB, any Subsidiary nor any IALB
ERISA Affiliate has any material liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation ("PBGC"), to the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), to the
Department of Labor ("DOL"), to the Employee Benefits Security Administration,
with respect to any Employee Plan, except for routine premium payments to the
PBGC.

(d) To the knowledge of IALB's Management, no "fiduciary," as defined in
Section 3(21) of ERISA, of an Employee Plan has failed to comply with the
requirements of Section 404 of ERISA in such a way as to cause material
liability to IALB, any Subsidiary or any IALB ERISA Affiliate.

(e) Each of the Employee Plans which is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has been timely amended to comply in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Code. Except as set forth in the IALB

letters with respect to any such Employee Plan that is intended to be

(f) Except as disclosed in the IALB Disclosure Letter, no Employee Plan has
incurred an "accumulated funding deficiency," as determined under Section 412
of the Code and Section 302 of ERISA. IALB has at all times met the minimum
funding standard, and has made all contributions required, under Section 412
of the Code and Section 302 of ERISA. No facts or circumstances exist that may
subject IALB, any Subsidiary, or any IALB ERISA Affiliate, to any liability
under Sections 4062, 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. Neither IALB, any Subsidiary nor
any IALB ERISA Affiliate ever has engaged in any transaction within the
meaning of Section 4069 of ERISA. Except as disclosed in the IALB Disclosure
Letter, there exist no facts or circumstances which could subject IALB, or any
IALB ERISA Affiliate thereof, to withdrawal liability within the meaning of
Section 4201 of ERISA or to contingent withdrawal liability under Section 4204
of ERISA. Neither IALB nor any IALB ERISA Affiliate ever has been a party to a
transaction within the meaning of Section 4212(c) of ERISA.

(g) No Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA has been terminated or
incurred a partial termination (either voluntarily or involuntarily), in such
a way as to cause material additional liability to IALB, any Subsidiary or any
IALB ERISA Affiliate. 

(h) No claims involving an Employee Plan (other than normal benefit claims)
have been filed in a court of law or, to the knowledge of IALB's Management,
have been threatened to be filed in a court of law.

(i) Except as set forth in the IALB Disclosure Letter, there is no contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement covering any employee, director or former
employee or director of IALB or any Subsidiary that, individually or
collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be
deductible by reason of Section 280G or Section 162(a)(1) of the Code.

(j) To the knowledge of IALB's Management, no event has occurred that would
cause the imposition of the tax described in Section 4980B of the Code on
IALB. To the knowledge of IALB's Management, IALB has materially complied with
all requirements of Section 601 of ERISA, as applicable, with respect to any
Employee Plan.

(k) The IALB Disclosure Letter contains a list of each employment, severance
or other similar contract, arrangement or policy and each plan or arrangement
(written or oral) providing for insurance coverage (including any self-insured
arrangements), workers' compensation, disability benefits, supplemental

compensation, profit sharing, bonuses, stock options, stock appreciation or
other forms of incentive compensation or post-retirement insurance,

into, maintained or contributed to, as the case may be, by IALB or any
Subsidiary and (iii) covers any employee, director or former employee or

furnished previously to First Merchants, are hereinafter referred to

Affiliate.

(m) Except as set forth in the IALB Disclosure Letter, there has been no
amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written)
by IALB, any Subsidiary or any IALB ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in
employee participation or coverage under, any Employee Plan or Benefit
Arrangement administered by IALB or any IALB ERISA Affiliate which would
increase materially the expense of maintaining such Employee Plans or Benefit
Arrangements above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

(n) Except as otherwise provided in the IALB Disclosure Letter, the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement will not cause acceleration of
vesting in, or payment of, any material benefits under any Employee Plan or
Benefit Arrangement and will not otherwise materially accelerate or increase
any obligation under any Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement.

(o) With respect to any nonqualified deferred compensation plan that is
subject to Section 409A of the Code, such plan has been identified on the IALB

accruals and/or reserves for payment therefore have been and are being made in

referred to in this Section 5.14 are correctly and accurately reflected and
accounted for in the books, statements and records of IALB and the
Subsidiaries, except where the failure to correctly and accurately reflect and

policy or other instrument, whether entered into in the ordinary course of
business or otherwise and whether written or oral, and there has not occurred

of First Merchants' Management threatened in any court or before any

exceptions, or violations with respect to which material refunds or

6.8 Financial Statements.

(a) First Merchants' consolidated audited balance sheets as of the end of the
two (2) fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for the years or period then ended (hereinafter collectively referred to
as the "First Merchants Financial Information") present fairly the
consolidated financial condition or position of First Merchants as of the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations of First
Merchants for the respective periods covered thereby and have been prepared in
conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis.

(b) All loans reflected in the First Merchants Financial Information and which
have been made, extended or acquired since September 30, 2016 (i) have been
made for good, valuable and adequate consideration in the ordinary course of
business; (ii) constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
obligor and any guarantor named therein; (iii) are evidenced by notes,
instruments or other evidences of indebtedness which are true, genuine and
what they purport to be; and (iv) to the extent that FMB has a security
interest in collateral or a mortgage securing such loans, are secured by
perfected security interests or mortgages naming FMB as the secured party or
mortgagee, except for such unperfected security interests or mortgages naming
FMB as secured party or mortgagee which, on an individual loan basis, would
not materially adversely affect the value of any such loan and the recovery of
payment on any such loan if FMB is not able to enforce any such security
interest or mortgage.

6.9 Absence of Certain Changes. Except for events and conditions relating to
the business and interest rate environment in general, the accrual or payment
of Merger-related expenses, or as set forth in the First Merchants Disclosure
Letter, since September 30, 2016, no events have occurred which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth
in the First Merchants Disclosure Letter, between the period from September
30, 2016 to the date of this Agreement, First Merchants and each First
Merchants Subsidiary have carried on their respective businesses in the
ordinary and usual course consistent with their past practices (excluding the
incurrence of reasonable fees and expenses of professional advisors related to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby). Since September 30,
2016, there has not been any declaration, setting aside or payment of any
dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with
respect to First Merchants' Common Stock (other than normal quarterly cash
dividends) or any split, combination or reclassification of any stock of First
Merchants or any First Merchants Subsidiary or any issuance or the
authorization of any issuance of any securities in respect of, or in lieu of,
or in substitution for First Merchants' Common Stock.

6.10 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth in the First
Merchants Disclosure Letter, neither First Merchants nor any First Merchants
Subsidiary has any liabilities, whether accrued, absolute, contingent, or
otherwise, existing or arising out of any transaction or state of facts
existing on or 

prior to the date hereof, except (a) as and to the extent disclosed, reflected
or reserved against in the First Merchants Financial Information, (b) any
agreement, contract, obligation, commitment, arrangement, liability, lease or
license which individually is less than Five Hundred Thousand and 00/100
Dollars ($500,000.00) per year and which may be terminated within one year

complete and accurate in all material respects; (b) paid all material taxes,
assessments and other governmental charges due and payable or claimed to be
due and payable upon them or any of their income, properties or assets; and
(c) not requested an extension of time for any such payments (which extension
is still in force). Except for taxes not yet due and payable, the reserve for
taxes on the First Merchants Financial Information is adequate to cover all of
First Merchants' and FMB's tax liabilities (including, without limitation,
income taxes and franchise fees) that may become payable in future years with
respect to any transactions consummated prior to September 30, 2016. Neither
First Merchants nor FMB has or will have, any liability for taxes of any

assets of any subsidiary, from September 30, 2016, up to and including the
Effective Date, except to the extent reflected on the First Merchants
Financial Information or on financial statements of First Merchants or any
subsidiary subsequent to such date and as set forth in the First Merchants
Disclosure Letter. Neither First Merchants nor FMB has received written notice

would not have a Material Adverse Effect. All such reports filed by First
Merchants and the First Merchants Subsidiaries complied in all material
respects with all applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the
applicable FMC Regulatory Authorities and were true, accurate and complete in
all material respects and, to the extent required, were prepared in conformity
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. There is no unresolved violation with

both, would constitute such a default, except for defaults which would not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

6.15 Tax and Regulatory Matters. Neither First Merchants nor any First
Merchants Subsidiary has taken or agreed to take any action or has any
knowledge of any fact or circumstance that would (a) prevent 

the transactions contemplated hereby from qualifying as a reorganization

SEC filings were true, accurate and complete in all material respects as of
the dates of the filings (except for information included therein as of a
certain date, which shall have been true and correct as of such date), and no
such filings, at the time they were filed, contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made, at the time and in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not false or misleading.

6.17 Broker's or Finder's Fees. Except for SunTrust Robinson Humphrey and

Merchants Subsidiaries.

6.19 Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties contained in this Section 6 shall expire on the Effective Date or

the First Merchants Subsidiaries and all directors and officers of First
Merchants and the First Merchants Subsidiaries shall have no further liability
with respect thereto.

6.20 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) The First Merchants Disclosure Letter contains a list identifying each
"employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, which (i) is
subject to any provision of ERISA, and (ii) is currently maintained,
administered or contributed to by First Merchants or any entity, trade or
business that, together with First Merchants, would be treated as a single
employer under the provisions of Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code
("First Merchants ERISA Affiliate"), and covers any employee, director or
former employee or director of First Merchants or any First Merchants ERISA
Affiliate under which First Merchants or any First Merchants ERISA Affiliate
has any liability. The First Merchants Disclosure Letter also contains a list
of all "employee benefit plans" as defined under ERISA which have been
terminated by First Merchants or any First Merchants ERISA Affiliate since
January 1, 2012. Copies of such plans (and, if applicable, related trust
agreements or insurance contracts) and all amendments thereto and written
interpretations thereof have been furnished to IALB together with the three
(3) most recent annual reports (Form 5500) prepared in connection with any
such plan and the current summary plan descriptions (and any 

summary of material modifications thereto). Such plans are hereinafter
referred to individually as a "First Merchants Employee Plan" and collectively
as the "First Merchants Employee Plans." The First Merchants Employee Plans
which individually or collectively would constitute an "employee pension
benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(2)(A) of ERISA are identified as such in
the list referred to above.

(b) The First Merchants Employee Plans have been operated in material
compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, rulings and other
requirements, as well as pursuant to the terms of their governing documents
(to the extent consistent with ERISA).

(c) Except as set forth in the First Merchants Disclosure letter, to the
knowledge of First Merchants' Management, no "prohibited transaction," as
defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, for which no
statutory or administrative exemption exists, and no "reportable event," as
defined in Section 4043(c) of ERISA, for which a notice is required to be
filed, has occurred with respect to any First Merchants Employee Plan that
could subject First Merchants to material taxes or penalties. Neither First
Merchants nor any First Merchants ERISA Affiliate has any material liability
to the PBGC, to the IRS, to the DOL, to the Employee Benefits Security
Administration, with respect to any First Merchants Employee Plan, except for
routine premium payments to the PBGC.

(d) To the knowledge of First Merchants' Management, no "fiduciary," as
defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA, of a First Merchants Employee Plan has
failed to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of ERISA in such a way
as to cause material liability to First Merchants or any First Merchants ERISA
Affiliate.

(e) Each of the First Merchants Employee Plans which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has been timely amended to comply
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Code. Except
as set forth in the First Merchants Disclosure Letter, First Merchants and/or
any First Merchants ERISA Affiliate, as applicable, sought and received
favorable determination letters from the IRS and has furnished to IALB copies
of the most recent IRS determination letters with respect to any such Employee
Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

(f) No First Merchants Employee Plan has incurred an "accumulated funding
deficiency," as determined under Section 412 of the Code and Section 302 of
ERISA. First Merchants has at all times met the minimum funding standard, and
has made all contributions required, under Section 412 of the Code and Section
302 of ERISA. No facts or circumstances exist that may subject First
Merchants, or any First Merchants ERISA Affiliate, to any liability under
Sections 4062, 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. Neither First Merchants nor any First
Merchants ERISA Affiliate ever has engaged in any transaction within the
meaning of Section 4069 of ERISA. Except as disclosed in the First Merchants
Disclosure Letter, there exist no facts or circumstances which could subject
First Merchants, or any First Merchants ERISA Affiliate thereof, to withdrawal
liability within the meaning of Section 4201 of ERISA or to contingent
withdrawal liability under Section 4204 of ERISA. Neither First Merchants nor
any First Merchants ERISA Affiliate ever has been a party to a transaction
within the meaning of Section 4212(c) of ERISA.

(g) No First Merchants Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA has been
terminated or incurred a partial termination (either voluntarily or
involuntarily), in such a way as to cause material additional liability to
First Merchants or any First Merchants ERISA Affiliate. 

(h) No claims involving a First Merchants Employee Plan (other than normal
benefit claims) have been filed in a court of law or, to the knowledge of
First Merchants' Management, have been threatened to be filed in a court of
law.

(i) There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any
employee, director or former employee or director of First Merchants or any
Subsidiary that, individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment
of any amount that would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G or
Section 162(a)(1) of the Code.

(j) To the knowledge of First Merchants' Management, no event has occurred
that would cause the imposition of the tax described in Section 4980B of the
Code on First Merchants or any First Merchants ERISA Affiliate. To the
knowledge of First Merchants' Management, First Merchants has materially
complied with all requirements of Section 601 or ERISA, as applicable, with
respect to any First Merchants Employee Plan.

(k) The First Merchants Disclosure Letter contains a list of each employment,
severance or other similar contract, arrangement or policy and each plan or
arrangement (written or oral) providing for insurance coverage (including any
self-insured arrangements), workers' compensation, disability benefits,
supplemental unemployment benefits, vacation benefits, retirement benefits or
deferred compensation, profit sharing, bonuses, stock options, stock
appreciation or other forms of incentive compensation or post-retirement
insurance, compensation or benefits which (i) is not a First Merchants
Employee Plan, (ii) was entered into, maintained or contributed to, as the
case may be, by First Merchants or any First Merchants Subsidiary and (iii)
covers any employee, director or former employee or director of First
Merchants or any First Merchants Subsidiary. Such contracts, plans and
arrangements as are described above, copies or descriptions of all of which
have been furnished previously to First Merchants, are hereinafter referred to
collectively as the "First Merchants Benefit Arrangements." Each of the First
Merchants Benefit Arrangements has been maintained in compliance in all
material respects with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any
and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations which are applicable to such
First Merchants Benefit Arrangements.

(l) Except as set forth in the First Merchants Disclosure Letter, neither
First Merchants nor any First Merchants ERISA Affiliate has any present or
future liability in respect of post-retirement health and medical benefits for
former employees or directors of First Merchants or any First Merchants ERISA
Affiliate.

(m) Except as set forth in the First Merchants Disclosure Letter, there has
been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or not
written) by First Merchants or any First Merchants ERISA Affiliate relating
to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any First Merchants
Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement administered by First Merchants or any
First Merchants ERISA Affiliate which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such First Merchants Employee Plans or First Merchants Benefit
Arrangements above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

(n) Except as otherwise provided in the First Merchants Disclosure Letter, the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement will not cause acceleration of
vesting in, or payment of, any material benefits under any First Merchants
Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement and will not otherwise materially
accelerate or increase any obligation under any First Merchants Employee Plan
or Benefit Arrangement. 

(o) With respect to any nonqualified deferred compensation plan that is
subject to Section 409A of the Code, such plan has been identified on the
Disclosure Letter and has been operated in accordance with, and is in
documentary compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued
thereunder.

Subsidiary; (xi) give, dispose, sell, convey, assign, hypothecate, pledge,
encumber or otherwise transfer or grant a security interest in any capital
stock of any Subsidiary; (xii) fail to make additions to the Bank's reserve
for loan losses, or any other reserve account, in the ordinary course of
business and in accordance with sound banking practices; (xiii) other than in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, incur any
indebtedness for borrowed money or assume, guarantee, endorse or otherwise as
an accommodation become responsible or liable for the obligations of any other
individual, corporation or other entity; and 

(xiv) agree in writing or otherwise to take any of the foregoing actions. The
prior consent of First Merchants for the items listed above may be withheld,
conditioned or delayed in its sole discretion.

(b) IALB and the Subsidiaries shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, in
full force and effect insurance on its properties and operations and fidelity
coverage on its directors, officers and employees in such amounts and with
regard to such liabilities and hazards as customarily are maintained by other
companies operating similar businesses.

(c) IALB shall provide and shall cause the Subsidiaries to provide First
Merchants and its representatives full access, during normal business hours
and on reasonable advance notice to IALB, to further information (to the
extent permissible under applicable law) and the Subsidiaries' premises for
purposes of (i) observing the Subsidiaries' business activities and operations
and to consult with IALB's officers and employees regarding the same on an
ongoing basis to verify compliance by IALB with all terms of this Agreement,
and (ii) making all necessary preparations for conversion of the Bank's
information technology systems, including, but not limited to, installation of
a hardware or software device(s) within the Bank's network to perform system
penetration testing or assess previous security breaches. First Merchants may
hire, at its expense, a mutually-agreeable third party consultant to perform
cybersecurity system testing and monitoring (based on a mutually-agreeable
project scope) in order to confirm that the Bank's technology systems are free
of security breaches and, if necessary, provide remediation and notices
related thereto. IALB and First Merchants shall each receive the results of
the testing and reasonably coordinate their efforts on any potential
remediation and notices. None of the foregoing actions shall unduly interfere
with the business operations of IALB or the Subsidiaries nor shall such
actions be permitted if such access relates to, (i) pending or threatened
litigation or investigations if, in the opinion of counsel to IALB, such
access would or might adversely affect the confidential nature of, or any
privilege relating to, the matters being discussed, or (ii) matters involving
an Acquisition Proposal. No investigation pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made in this
Agreement by IALB. First Merchants will use such information as is provided to
it by IALB or the Subsidiaries, or representatives thereof, solely for the
purpose of conducting business, legal and financial reviews of IALB and the
Subsidiaries and for such other purposes as may be related to this Agreement,
and First Merchants will, and will direct all of its agents, employees and
advisors to, maintain the confidentiality of all such information in
accordance with the terms of Section 8.5 below. Neither IALB nor any of the
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its
customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the entity in
possession or control of such information or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties will make
appropriate and reasonable substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

7.4 Preservation of Business. On and after the date of this Agreement and
until the Effective Date or until this Agreement is terminated as herein
provided, IALB and the Subsidiaries shall (a) carry on their business
diligently, substantially in the same manner as heretofore conducted, and in
the ordinary course of business; (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to
preserve their business organizations intact, to keep their present officers
and employees and to preserve their present relationship with customers and
others having business dealings with them; and (c) not do or fail to do
anything which will cause a material breach of, or material default in, any
contract, agreement, commitment, obligation, understanding, arrangement, lease
or license to which they are a party or by which they are or may be subject or
bound. 

7.5 Other Negotiations.

(a) IALB shall not, and shall cause the Bank to not, during the term of this
Agreement, directly or indirectly, solicit, encourage or facilitate inquiries
or proposals or enter into any agreement with respect to, or initiate or
participate in any negotiations or discussions with any person or entity
concerning, any proposed transaction or series of transactions involving or
affecting IALB or the Subsidiaries (or the securities or assets of the
foregoing) that, if effected, would constitute an acquisition of control of
either IALB, or the Subsidiaries within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. ยง1817(j)
(disregarding the exceptions set forth in 12 U.S.C. ยง1817(j)(17)) and the
regulations of the Federal Reserve Board thereunder (each, an "Acquisition
Proposal"), or furnish any information to any person or entity proposing or
seeking an Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that IALB's Board of Directors
determines in good faith and after consultation with outside counsel, that in
light of an Acquisition Proposal, it is necessary to provide such information
or engage in such negotiations or discussions in order to act in a manner
consistent with such Board's fiduciary duties, IALB's Board of Directors may,
in response to an Acquisition Proposal which was not solicited by or on behalf
of IALB or the Bank or which did not otherwise result from a breach of Section
7.5(a), subject to its compliance with Section 7.5(c), (i) furnish information
with respect to IALB or the Bank to such person or entity making such
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement that is
no less restrictive than the Confidentiality Agreement between IALB and First
Merchants and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such
Acquisition Proposal. In the event that IALB's Board of Directors determines
in good faith and after consultation with outside counsel, that the
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) and
that it is necessary to pursue such Superior Acquisition Proposal in order to
act in a manner consistent with such Board's fiduciary duties, IALB may (A)
withdraw, modify or otherwise change in a manner adverse to First Merchants,
the recommendation of IALB's Board of Directors to its shareholders with
respect to this Agreement and the Merger, and/or (B) terminate this Agreement
in order to concurrently enter into an agreement with respect to such Superior
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that IALB's Board of Directors may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.5(b) unless and until
(x) ten (10) business days have elapsed following the delivery to First
Merchants of a written notice of such determination by IALB's Board of
Directors and during such ten (10) business-day period, IALB and the Bank
otherwise cooperate with First Merchants with the intent of enabling the
parties to engage in good faith negotiations so that the Merger and other
transactions contemplated hereby may be effected and (y) at the end of such
ten (10) business-day period IALB's Board of Directors continues reasonably to
believe the Acquisition Proposal at issue constitutes a Superior Acquisition
Proposal. A "Superior Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any Acquisition
Proposal containing terms which IALB's Board of Directors determines in its
good faith judgment (based on the advice of an independent financial advisor)
to be more favorable to IALB's shareholders than the Merger and for which
financing, to the extent required, is then committed or which, in the good
faith judgment of IALB's Board of Directors, is reasonably capable of being
obtained by such third party, but shall exclude any Acquisition Proposal the
terms of which were made known to IALB's Board of Directors prior to the date
of this Agreement.

(c) In addition to the obligations of IALB set forth in Section 7.5(a) and
(b), IALB shall advise First Merchants orally and in writing as soon as
reasonably practicable of any request (whether oral or in writing) for
information or of any inquiries, proposals, discussions or indications of
interest (whether oral or in writing) with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request or Acquisition
Proposal and the identity of the person or entity making such request 

or Acquisition Proposal. IALB shall keep First Merchants reasonably informed
of the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any
such request or Acquisition Proposal, including the status of any discussions
or negotiations with respect to any Superior Acquisition Proposal.

7.6 Announcement; Press Releases. In connection with the execution of this
Agreement, IALB and First Merchants intend to jointly issue a press release
mutually acceptable to the parties. Except as otherwise required by law,
neither IALB nor the Bank shall issue any additional press releases or make
any other public announcements or disclosures relating to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby without the prior approval of First
Merchants provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7.6 shall be deemed
to prohibit any party from making any disclosure that its counsel deems
necessary in order to satisfy such party's disclosure obligation imposed by
law.

7.7 IALB Disclosure Letter. IALB shall supplement, amend and update as of the
Effective Date the IALB Disclosure Letter with respect to any matters
hereafter arising which, if in existence or having occurred as of the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the
IALB Disclosure Letter. If, at any time prior to the Effective Date, IALB
becomes aware of a fact or matter that might indicate that any of the
representations and warranties of IALB herein may be untrue, incorrect or
misleading in any material respect, IALB shall promptly disclose such fact or
matter to First Merchants in writing.

7.8 Confidentiality. IALB and the Subsidiaries shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their respective officers, employees, and
authorized representatives to hold in strict confidence all confidential data
and information obtained by them from First Merchants, unless such information
(a) was already known to IALB and the Subsidiaries, (b) becomes available to
IALB and the Subsidiaries from other sources, (c) is independently developed
by IALB and the Subsidiaries, (d) is disclosed by IALB or the Subsidiaries
with and in accordance with the terms of prior written approval of First
Merchants, or (e) is or becomes readily ascertainable from public or published
information or trade sources or public disclosure of such information is
required by law or requested by a court or other governmental agency,
commission, or regulatory body. IALB and the Subsidiaries further agree that,
in the event this Agreement is terminated, they will return to First
Merchants, or destroy, all information obtained by IALB and the Subsidiaries
from First Merchants or a First Merchants Subsidiary, including all copies
made of such information by IALB and the Subsidiaries. This provision shall
survive the Effective Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement.

7.9 Cooperation. IALB and the Bank shall generally cooperate with First
Merchants and its officers, employees, attorneys, accountants and other
agents, and, generally, do such other acts and things in good faith as may be
reasonable, necessary or appropriate to timely effectuate the intents and
purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, (a) IALB shall cooperate
and assist First Merchants in the preparation of and/or filing of all
regulatory applications, the Registration Statement, and all other
documentation required to be prepared for consummation of the Merger and the
Bank Merger and obtaining all necessary approvals, and (b) IALB shall furnish
First Merchants with all information concerning itself and the Subsidiaries
that First Merchants may request in connection with the preparation of the
documentation referenced above.

7.10 IALB Fairness Opinion. On the date hereof or as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date hereof, IALB shall use its reasonable best
efforts to procure the written opinion from ProBank Austin to the Board of
Directors of IALB to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the
Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of IALB
Common Stock (the "IALB Fairness Opinion"). The IALB Fairness Opinion shall be
included in the Proxy Statement (as defined below). 

7.11 Financial Statements and Other Reports. Promptly upon its becoming
available, IALB shall furnish to First Merchants one (1) copy of each

while knowing that such action would, or is reasonably likely to, prevent or
impede the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368 of the Code; or (b) knowingly take any action that is intended or
is reasonably likely to result in (i) any of its representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement being or becoming untrue in any
material respect at any time at or prior to the Effective Date, (ii) any of
the conditions to the Merger set forth in Section 9 not being satisfied, (iii)
a material violation of any provision of this Agreement, or (iv) a material
delay in the consummation of the Merger except, in each case, as may be
required by applicable law or regulation.

Bank to execute and deliver the Bank Merger Agreement contemporaneously

Merchants will file an application with the Federal Reserve Board and the
Indiana Department of Financial Institutions ("IDFI") for approval of the
Merger and an application with the IDFI and the FDIC for approval of the Bank

maximums under health plans of First Merchants in which they are eligible to
participate after the Effective Date in the same plan year in which such
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred, and (iii)
waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement
that would otherwise be applicable to an employee of IALB or the Subsidiaries
and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Effective Date, in each

similar limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior to the
Effective Date.

(c) Severance. For any employee of IALB who did not have an employment
agreement, change in control agreement or severance agreement, who is not
offered employment with First 

Merchants or FMB with salary and bonus opportunities substantially the same as

additional press releases or make any other public announcements or
disclosures relating to the Merger or the Bank Merger without the prior

deemed to prohibit any party from making any disclosure that its counsel deems
necessary in order to satisfy such party's disclosure obligation imposed by

policy to cover the present and former officers and directors of IALB and the
Bank (determined as of the Effective Date) with respect to claims against such
directors and officers arising from facts or events which occurred before the
Effective Date, which insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and
amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous, as that

Period more than 1.5 times the annual amount paid by IALB for its director and
officer liability insurance coverage prior to the Effective Date (the

maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 8.5, First
Merchants shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable
insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount; provided, further, that
officers and directors of IALB or the Bank may be required to make application

insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance.

(b) Following the Effective Date, First Merchants will provide any IALB or
Subsidiary officers, directors and employees who become officers, directors
and employees of the Continuing Company or its subsidiaries with the same
directors and officers liability insurance coverage and indemnification
protections that First Merchants provides to other officers, directors and
employees of First Merchants or its subsidiaries. In addition, First Merchants
further agrees to indemnify and advance expenses to the current and former
directors and officers of IALB and the Subsidiaries after the Effective Date,

omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Date now existing in favor of
the current or former directors or officers of IALB and the Subsidiaries as
provided in their respective Articles of Incorporation and By-laws and any
existing indemnification agreements or arrangements of IALB or the
Subsidiaries described in the IALB Disclosure Letter, shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms to
the extent permitted by law, and shall be honored by First Merchants following

occurring or alleged to occur on or prior to the Effective Date.

(d) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including,
without limitation, any such claim, action suit, proceeding or investigation
in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Date, a director or

obligations under Section 7.1;

(d) by either First Merchants or IALB, if either (i) any approval, consent or

appropriate damages from the breaching party, including, without limitation,
reimbursement to the non-breaching party of its costs, fees and expenses

documentation; provided further, however, that nothing in the foregoing
proviso shall be deemed to constitute liquidated damages for the breach by a
party of the terms of this Agreement or otherwise limit the rights of the non-
breaching party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of termination by
IALB in accordance with Section 10.1(f) or by First Merchants in accordance
with Section 10.1(g), Section 10.1(h)(i) or Section 10.1(h)(ii), then IALB
