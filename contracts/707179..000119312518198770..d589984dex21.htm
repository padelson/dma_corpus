(&#147;Acquirer&#148;) and Klein Financial, Inc. (&#147;KFI&#148;), KFI will be merged with and into Acquirer, effective as of <B>[date]</B>. </P>

Acquirer will pay the Tax Distribution Indemnification Amount to you no later than five days after receipt from you of the certifications described in the following paragraph. Acquirer will not pay any penalties, interest or additions to tax
assessed to you as a result of a failure to pay estimated taxes on a timely basis with respect to taxable income unrelated to KFI, or if you failed to timely make the appropriate estimated tax payments in 2018 related to tax distributions from KFI

estimated taxes in a timely manner in connection with the allocated components of your KFI 2018 taxable income are reported on the income tax returns as due and payable, you must provide to Acquirer a written certification of the Tax Distribution
Indemnification Amount. If, after filing the relevant income tax returns, you receive notice of assessment from the tax authorities that any additional penalties, interest or additions to tax attributable to failure to pay 2018 estimated taxes in a
