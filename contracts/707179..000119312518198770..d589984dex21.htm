MERGER

2.1 _The Merger_. Under the terms of this Agreement and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 7, at the
Effective Time, KFI will be merged with and into Acquirer. Acquirer, in its
capacity as the corporation surviving the Merger, is sometimes referred to
herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_." The Merger will be effected pursuant
to the provisions of, and with the effect provided in, the Indiana Business
Corporation Law, Indiana Code 23-1-40 and Section 302A.651 of the Minnesota
Business Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ ").

 

2.2 _Effect of Merger_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, KFI will be merged with and into Acquirer, and the
separate existence of KFI will cease. The Articles of Incorporation and the
Bylaws of Acquirer, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will
be the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,
until the same may be amended as provided therein and in accordance with
applicable Law. The directors and officers of Acquirer immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and will qualify.

 



10 (b) At the Effective Time, the title to all assets, real estate and
other property owned by KFI shall vest in the Surviving Corporation as set
forth in Indiana Code Section 23-1-40-6, as amended, without reversion or
impairment. At the Effective Time, all liabilities of KFI shall be assumed by
the Surviving Corporation as set forth in Indiana Code Section 23-1-40-6, as
amended.

(c) To effect the Merger, on or before the Closing Date, the parties hereto
will cause the Articles of Merger substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit_ __ _ B_ (the " _Indiana_ _Articles of Merger_ ") and Articles of
Merger substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ __ _ C_ (the "
_Minnesota Articles of Merger_ ") relating to the Merger to be filed with the
Indiana Secretary of State and the Secretary of State of Minnesota,
respectively. 

(d) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions specified in this Agreement,
unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties hereto, the closing date
will occur on the last business day of the month following (i) the fulfillment
of all conditions precedent to the Merger set forth in Article 7 of this
Agreement and (ii) the expiration of all waiting periods in connection with
the bank regulatory applications filed for the approval of the Merger (the
_"Closing Date"_ ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if the Closing Date
were to occur on the last business day of November, then the Closing Date
will be the last business day of December, and (ii) the Closing Date will not
occur prior to September 30, 2018. The Merger will be effective as of 12:01
a.m. on the first calendar day of the month following the Closing Date (the
_"Effective Date"_ ) as specified in the Indiana Articles of Merger and the
Minnesota Articles of Merger (the _"Effective Time"_ ).

 

2.3 _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. At Acquirers election, the
Merger may alternatively be structured so that (a) KFI is merged with and
into any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquirer or (b)
any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquirer is merged with and
into KFI; _provided, however,_ that no such change shall (x) alter or change
the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration (as hereinafter defined) or the
treatment of the holders of KFI Common Stock, (y) prevent KFI from obtaining
the opinion of counsel referred to in Section 7.2(e) or otherwise cause the
transaction to fail to qualify for the tax treatment described in Section 2.12
or (z) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event of such an election, the parties
agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement (to the extent
such amendment only changes the method of effecting the business combination
and does not substantively affect this Agreement or the rights and obligations
of the parties or their respective shareholders) in order to reflect such
election.

2.4 _Conversion of KFI Common Stock_.

 

(a) To effectuate the Merger, at the Effective Time, and without any further
action of Acquirer, KFI or any holder of KFI Common Stock, each share of KFI
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) shares held as treasury stock of KFI, (ii) shares held
directly or indirectly by Acquirer, except shares held in a fiduciary
capacity or in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted, if any, and (iii)
Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined)) will be canceled and extinguished
and be converted into and become a right to receive 7.92 shares (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") (as adjusted in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement) of Acquirer Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 



11 (b) Fractional shares of Acquirer Common Stock will be issued for KFI
Converted Common Shares.

(c) Each share of KFI Common Stock held as treasury stock of KFI or held
directly or indirectly by Acquirer (other than shares held in a fiduciary
capacity or in satisfaction of Indebtedness previously contracted) will be
canceled, retired and cease to exist, and no exchange or payment will be made
with respect thereto.

 

2.5 _Adjustments to Acquirer Common Stock_. If Acquirer changes (or
establishes a record date for changing) the number of shares of Acquirer
Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time by way of a
stock split, stock dividend, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or
similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Acquirer Common Stock,
and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted so the shareholders of KFI at the Effective
Time shall receive, in the aggregate, such number of shares of Acquirer
Common Stock representing the same percentage of outstanding shares of
Acquirer Common Stock as would have been represented by the number of shares
of Acquirer Common Stock the shareholders of KFI would have received if any
of the foregoing actions had not occurred. No adjustment shall be made under
this Section 2.5 solely as a result of Acquirer issuing additional shares of
Acquirer Common Stock provided it receives fair market value consideration
for such shares or such shares are issued in connection with the Acquirer
employee benefit plans.

2.6 _Adjustment to Exchange Ratio_. At the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio
shall be adjusted, if applicable (which Exchange Ratio, as adjusted as
provided below and in Section 2.5, shall become the "Exchange Ratio" for
purposes of this Agreement), in accordance with this Section 2.6. If KFI
Consolidated Shareholders Equity as of the Determination Date is less than
Minimum Shareholders Equity, the Exchange Ratio shall be decreased to a
quotient determined by dividing the Adjusted Stock Purchase Price by the
total number of shares of KFI Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time,
and further dividing that number by the Acquirer Closing Date Stock Price.

 

2.7 _Rights of Holders of KFI Common Stock; Capital Stock of Acquirer_.

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding stock certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented the KFI Converted Common
Shares will be deemed for all purposes to evidence the right to receive the
(i) Merger Consideration for each KFI Converted Common Share and (ii) any
dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive
under Section 2.8(g). The record holder of such outstanding stock certificate
will, after the Effective Time, be entitled to vote the shares of Acquirer
Common Stock into which such shares of KFI Common Stock will have been
converted on any matters on which the holders of record of Acquirer Common
Stock, as of or on any date subsequent to the Effective Time, will

 



12  be entitled to vote subject to compliance with Section 2.8. In any matters
relating to such stock certificates, Acquirer may rely conclusively upon the
record of shareholders maintained by KFI containing the names and addresses
of the holders of record of KFI Common Stock at the Effective Time.

(b) At and after the Effective Time, each share of capital stock of Acquirer
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain an
issued and existing share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation and
will not be affected by the Merger.

2.8 _Payment and Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment of Merger Consideration; Exchange of Certificates_. As promptly
as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days thereafter, Acquirer will cause to be distributed to each holder
of record of shares of KFI Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time which have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive the applicable Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to certificates shall pass only upon proper
delivery of the certificates to Acquirer) with a form providing instructions
and requesting usual and customary information necessary to facilitate the
surrender of certificates representing such shares and effect the exchange for
the Merger Consideration (including fractional shares) and any dividends or
distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive under Section
2.8(g) for each KFI Converted Common Share (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ").
Upon receipt by Acquirer or a paying agent appointed by Acquirer of a
properly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal, Acquirer or such paying
agent shall cause a statement of ownership of book-entry shares representing
the Merger Consideration (including fractional shares) to be delivered to
such holder and payment of dividends or distributions which such holder shall
be entitled to receive in the manner provided in the Letter of Transmittal. A
Letter of Transmittal will be deemed received by Acquirer only if Acquirer
shall have received a fully and properly completed and signed (including duly
executed transmittal materials included in the Letter of Transmittal) Letter
of Transmittal. No interest will be paid on any Merger Consideration that any
such holder shall be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section upon such
delivery.

(b) The stock transfer books of KFI shall be closed immediately upon the
Effective Time and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer records of KFI of any shares of KFI Common
Stock.

 

(c) Acquirer shall be entitled to rely upon KFIs stock transfer books to
establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the
event of a dispute with respect to ownership of any KFI Common Stock, Acquirer
shall be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in
escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved from any and
all liability with respect to any claims thereto.

 



13 (d) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Letter of
Transmittal, Acquirer, in the exercise of its reasonable, good faith
discretion, shall have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent
with the terms of this Agreement, governing (i) the validity of all Letters of
Transmittal and compliance by any holder of KFI Common Stock with the
exchange procedures set forth herein and (ii) the method of issuance and
delivery of a statement of ownership of book-entry shares representing the
number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock into which shares of KFI Common
Stock are converted in the Merger.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of KFI Common Stock that are held as treasury stock
of KFI or owned by Acquirer (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or
in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and no stock of KFI or other consideration shall be exchanged
therefor.

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any certificate representing KFI Converted Common
Shares will have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Acquirer will issue and pay
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof in a form satisfactory to
Acquirer or Acquirers paying agent, as applicable, the Merger Consideration
for each KFI Converted Common Share.

 

(g) _Dividends_. Until outstanding certificates formerly representing KFI
Converted Common Shares are surrendered as provided in Section 2.8(a), no
dividend or distribution payable to holders of record of shares of Acquirer
Common Stock will be paid to any holder of such outstanding certificates, but
upon surrender of such outstanding certificates by such holder, there will be
paid to such holder the amount of any dividends or distributions (without
interest) theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Acquirer
Common Stock, but not paid to such holder, and which dividends or
distributions had a record date occurring on or subsequent to the Effective
Time.

(h) _Failure to Surrender Certificates_. If outstanding certificates formerly
representing KFI Converted Common Shares are not surrendered prior to the date
on which the Merger Consideration to which any holder of such shares is
entitled as a result of the Merger would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, the unclaimed Merger Consideration will,
to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable Law,
become the property of Acquirer (and to the extent not in
Acquirers possession, will be paid over to Acquirer), free and clear of any
and all claims or interest of any Person, provided notice to KFIs
representatives identified in Section 9.2 of any shares not surrendered is
delivered at least sixty (60) days prior to such escheatment date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Acquirer nor any other Person will be
liable to any former holder of KFI Common Stock for any amount delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws.

(i) _Full Satisfaction_. The Merger Consideration issued and paid upon the
surrender for exchange of each KFI Converted Common Share in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed to have been issued
and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such KFI Converted
Common Share.

 



14 2.9 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) The holders of KFI Common Stock are entitled to dissenters rights under
Section 302A.471 of the MBCA.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of KFI Common Stock that are issued and outstanding and held by a
Person (a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ") who has demanded and perfected a
demand for payment of the fair value of his, her or its shares of KFI Common
Stock in accordance with Section 302A.473 of the MBCA and, as of the
Effective Time, has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost his, her or its
right to such demand will not represent a right to receive Merger
Consideration for any share of KFI Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.4 , but
in lieu thereof the holder thereof will be entitled to only such rights as
are granted by the MBCA.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.9(a), if any Dissenting
Shareholder demanding payment of fair value of such Dissenting Shareholders
shares of KFI Common Stock (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") under the MBCA will
effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such
Dissenting Shareholders right to demand such payment, then, as of the
Effective Time or the time of such withdrawal or loss, whichever occurs later,
each Dissenting Share will automatically be converted into and represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.4 upon
surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such Dissenting
Shares.

 

(d) KFI will give Acquirer prompt notice of any written objection by a
Dissenting Shareholder to the Merger or any demands by a Dissenting
Shareholder for payment of fair value of his, her or its shares of KFI Common
Stock received by KFI in accordance with Section 302A.473 of the MBCA, and
Acquirer will have the right, at its expense, to direct in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. KFI will not, except with the
prior written consent of Acquirer or as otherwise required by Law, make any
payment with respect to, settle, or offer to settle, any such demands.
Acquirer will make any payments, settlement and offers of settlements to
Dissenting Shareholders with respect to demands made pursuant to Section
302A.473 of the MBCA (" _Dissenting Shareholder Payments_ ").

 

2.10 _The Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Acquirer
located at One Main Street, Evansville, Indiana, or at a location otherwise
agreed upon by Acquirer and KFI. The failure of the Closing at an agreed upon
place and time will not _ipso facto_ result in termination of this Agreement
and will not relieve any party of any obligation under this Agreement.

Date, KFI will deliver to Acquirer:

7.3(c);

and will cause KleinBank and their respective Subsidiaries to permit, Acquirer
and Acquirers Agents (defined below), to have full and continuing access on
reasonable notice and at reasonable hours to the properties of KFI, KleinBank
and their respective Subsidiaries, and will disclose and make available
(together with the right to copy) to Acquirer and to the internal auditors,
loan review officers, employees, attorneys, accountants and
other representatives (" _Agents_ ") of Acquirer with a business need to
access such information all books, papers and records relating to the assets,
stock, properties, operations, obligations and liabilities of KFI, KleinBank
and their respective Subsidiaries, including all books of account (including

shareholders meetings, organizational documents, bylaws, Contracts, filings
with any regulatory authority, accountants work papers, Litigation files
(including legal research memoranda), documents relating to assets and title

personal property), Plans affecting employees, securities transfer records and
shareholder lists, and any books, papers and records relating to other assets,
business activities or prospects in which Acquirer may have a reasonable
interest, including its interest in planning for integration and transition
with respect to the businesses of KFI, KleinBank and their respective
Subsidiaries. In addition, KFI will instruct the officers, employees, counsel
and accountants of each of KFI, KleinBank and their respective Subsidiaries to
be available for, and respond to any questions of, such Acquirer Agents at
reasonable hours and with reasonable notice by Acquirer to such individuals,
and to cooperate fully with Acquirer in planning for the integration of the
businesses of KFI, KleinBank and their respective Subsidiaries with the
business of Acquirer and its Affiliates. No investigation by Acquirer or KFI
shall affect the representations and warranties made by KFI or Acquirer
herein.

(b) Any confidential information or trade secrets of each of KFI, KleinBank
and their respective Subsidiaries received by Acquirer or its Agents, and any
confidential information of Acquirer or Acquirers Agents received by KFI or
KFIs Agents, in the course of the consummation of the Merger or Bank Merger
will be treated confidentially and held in confidence pursuant to the NDA, and
any correspondence, memoranda, records, copies, documents and electronic or
other media of any kind containing either such confidential information or
trade secrets or both will be destroyed by receiving party or, at the
disclosing partys request, returned to the disclosing party if this Agreement
is terminated as provided in ARTICLE 8\. Such information will not be used by
a receiving party or its Agents to the detriment of the disclosing party or
its Subsidiaries and will at all times be maintained and held in compliance
with the NDA.

 



50 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated, neither Acquirer nor KFI
will disclose, except as required by Law or pursuant to the request of a
Governmental Entity, the basis or reason for such termination, without the
consent of the other party.

 

(d) Each of the parties to this Agreement disclosing information under the
terms of this Agreement is not waiving, and will not be deemed to have waived
or diminished, any of its attorney work product protections, attorney-client
privileges or similar protections and privileges as a result of disclosing
such information (including information related to pending or
threatened Litigation) to the other party, regardless of whether the
disclosing party has asserted, or is or may be entitled to assert, such
privileges and protections. Each party will be permitted to keep confidential
any information that (i) it reasonably believes is subject to legal privilege
that would be compromised by disclosure to the other party, and (ii) it is
prohibited by Law from sharing.

 

(e) The parties to this Agreement (i) share a common legal and commercial
interest in all of the disclosing partys information that is subject to such
privileges and protections; (ii) are or may become joint defendants in
proceedings to which the disclosing partys information covered by such
protections and privileges relates; (iii) intend that such privileges and
protections remain intact should either party become subject to any actual or
threatened proceeding to which the disclosing partys information covered by
such protections and privileges relates and (iv) intend that, after the
Closing, the receiving party will have the right to assert such protections
and privileges. No receiving party will admit, claim or contend, in
proceedings involving either party or otherwise, that any disclosing party
waived any of its attorney work-product protections, attorney-client
privileges or similar protections and privileges with respect to any
information, documents or other material not disclosed to a receiving party
due to such disclosing party disclosing its information (including
information related to pending or threatened Litigation) to the receiving
party.

5.3 _Notice of Developments_. KFI will promptly notify Acquirer of any
emergency or other change in the Ordinary Course of Business of KFI, KleinBank
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to the extent permitted by Law. KFI
will promptly notify Acquirer in writing if KFI should discover that any
representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement was untrue when made,
has subsequently become or will be on the Closing Date untrue in any respect,
provided that such inaccuracy would be reasonably anticipated to have a
Material Adverse Effect on KFI, KleinBank or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. No disclosure pursuant to this Section 5.3 will be deemed to
amend or supplement the KFI Disclosure Schedule or to prevent or cure any
inaccuracy, misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of agreement.

5.4 _Certain Loans and Related Matters_. KFI will furnish to Acquirer a
complete and accurate list as of the end of each calendar month beginning with
June 2018 within fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of each such
calendar month, of (a) all of the periodic internal credit quality reports of
KleinBank prepared during such calendar month (which reports will be prepared
in a manner consistent with past practices), (b) all loans of KleinBank
classified as non-accrual, as restructured, as ninety (90) days past due, as
still accruing and doubtful of collection or any comparable classification,
(c) all OREO, including in-substance foreclosures and real

 



51  estate in judgment, (d) all new loans where the principal amount advanced
exceeds $1,000,000, (e) any current repurchase obligations of KleinBank with

or revenue bonds and (f) any standby letters of credit issued by KleinBank.

 

5.5 _Financial Statements_. KFI will furnish Acquirer with balance sheets of
KFI and KleinBank as of the end of each calendar month beginning with June
2018 and the related statements of income, within fifteen (15) Business Days

prepared on a basis consistent with the Latest Balance Sheets and the Related
Statements and on a consistent basis during the periods involved, and will
fairly present the financial positions of KFI and KleinBank as of the dates
thereof and the results of operations of KFI and KleinBank for the
periods then ended.

5.6 _Consents and Authorizations_. KFI will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain (at no cost to Acquirer), prior to Closing, all consents
(the " _Required Consents_ ") from Persons other than Governmental Entities
necessary or reasonably desirable for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. KFI will keep Acquirer reasonably advised of
the status of obtaining the Required Consents, and Acquirer will reasonably
cooperate with KFI to obtain the Required Consents.

 

5.7 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) KFI and KleinBank each, at its own expense, will prepare and timely file
(or cause to be prepared and timely filed) all Returns required to be filed
by KFI or KleinBank on or before the Effective Date and timely pay all Taxes
reflected thereon. Such Returns will be prepared consistently with past
practices of KFI and KleinBank to the extent such practices comply
with applicable Law. No later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date
(including extensions) for filing any income or franchise Returns referred to
in the first sentence of this subsection (a), KFI or KleinBank, as relevant,
will deliver such Returns to Acquirer for its review, comment and approval,
which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. KFI
or KleinBank, as applicable, will make all changes and disclosures with
respect to all such income and franchise Returns as are reasonably requested
by Acquirer.

(b) Acquirer, at its own expense, will prepare and timely file (or cause to
be prepared and timely filed) all Returns of KFI and KleinBank required to be
filed after the Effective Date. Acquirer will prepare and file all such
Returns in respect of a taxable period which ends on or prior to the Effective
Date that are not required to be filed on or before the Effective Date, and
all such Returns in respect of a taxable period which begins before and ends
after the Effective Date to the extent such practices comply with applicable
Law. No later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing any
income or franchise Returns of KFI referred to in the first sentence of this
subsection (b) that KFI will file as an S corporation, Acquirer will deliver
drafts of such Returns to the Shareholder Representatives for their review
and comment on behalf of the Persons who were KFI shareholders during the Tax
period covered by such Return. Acquirer will consider all comments in good
faith and will incorporate such comments, changes or disclosures Acquirer
determines acceptable, in its reasonable discretion, in the applicable Return
prior to filing; _provided, however,_ Acquirer will make any change to a
Return that is required to correct an obvious error or to ensure that the
Return complies with applicable Law.

 



52 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Acquirer will
not amend, or cause to be amended, any income or franchise Return that KFI
filed as an S corporation if such amendment could result in material
additional Tax Liability being imposed on any Person that was a holder of KFI
Common Stock during the Tax period covered by such Return except where the
amendment of such Return is required (i) by a determination within the meaning
of Section 1313 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder with
respect to another Return, (ii) to correct an obvious error or to apply the
mitigation provisions of Section 1311 through 1314 of the Code or (iii)
otherwise by applicable Law (other than an interpretation of Law by the IRS
pursuant to an audit of such Return for which any proposed assessments have
not yet been fully resolved).

(d) Each of Acquirer and KFI will be liable for fifty percent (50%) of any
transfer, value added, excise, stock transfer, capital, stamp, recording,
registration and any similar Taxes (" _Transfer Tax_ ") that become payable in
connection with the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby. The
applicable parties will cooperate in preparing and filing such forms and
documents as may be necessary to permit any such Transfer Tax to be assessed
and paid on or prior to the Effective Date in accordance with any available
pre-sale filing procedure, and to obtain any exemption from or refund of any
such Transfer Tax.

 

(e) KFI, KleinBank, and Acquirer will cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of
Returns pursuant to this Section 5.7 and in connection with any audit,
examination, review, inquiry, Litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation will include the retention and (upon the other
partys reasonable request) the provision of records and information
(including making such records and information available for review and
copying) which the other party believes in good faith to be relevant to any
such audit, examination, review, inquiry, Litigation or other proceeding or
determination, the timely provision to the other party of powers of attorney
or similar authorizations necessary to carry out the purposes of this Section
5.7, and making employees, advisers and contractors available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Acquirer, KFI and KleinBank agree to retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to either KFI or
KleinBank relating to any taxable period which ends on or prior to the
Effective Date until the expiration of the longer or longest determination of
a statute of limitations for either assessment or collection of tax (and, to
the extent notified by Acquirer or its Affiliate, any extensions thereof) of
the respective taxable periods that may apply to KFI or KleinBank, and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental
Entity. 

 



53 (f) From and after the date of this Agreement, KFI shall not declare and pay
cash dividends to its shareholders in connection with any quarterly estimated
Tax payments. Acquirer agrees to indemnify and reimburse each KFI shareholder
for any tax penalties and interest payable, in the amounts indicated on the
income tax returns of each such shareholder for the 2018 tax year and any
subsequent tax period ending on or before the Effective Date, by offering to
enter into a Tax Indemnity Letter with each KFI shareholder in the form
attached as _Exhibit G_. Acquirer also agrees to pay KFI shareholders a tax
distribution in an amount equal to the difference between the Shareholder Tax
Liability reflected on the returns prepared and filed in accordance with
Section 5.7(b) and the Tax dividends actually paid for the 2018 tax year and
any subsequent tax period ending on or before the Effective Date, and such
payments shall be made the date such returns are required to be filed without
extension. For purposes of this Section " _Shareholder Tax Liability_ " shall
be an amount equal to 38.3% of the total of such shareholders allocated
components of federal taxable income, loss and deductions with respect to
their ownership of KFI Common Stock, as such components would be reported on
federal Schedule K-1 for the related Tax periods.

5.8 _No Solicitation_. 

(a) Neither KFI, nor KleinBank nor any of their respective Subsidiaries will,
and they will each use their best efforts to cause their officers, directors,
employees, agents and authorized representatives (" _Representatives_ ") not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or
facilitate the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal
or take any action that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) furnish any information regarding either KFI, KleinBank or any
of their respective Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with or in
response to an Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry or indication of interest
that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any
Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction;
_provided, however,_ that prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Required KFI Shareholder Vote, this Section 5.8(a) will not prohibit KFI or
its Representatives from furnishing nonpublic information regarding KFI,
KleinBank or their respective Subsidiaries to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, any Person in response to a Superior Proposal that is
submitted to KFI by such Person (and not withdrawn) if (1) neither KFI, nor
KleinBank, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective Representatives have violated any of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.8(a)(i)-(v), (2) the board of directors of KFI concludes in
good faith, after having consulted with and considered the advice of outside
counsel to KFI, that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to result in
a breach of its fiduciary obligations to KFIs shareholders under applicable
Law, (3) at least two (2) Business Days prior to furnishing any such nonpublic
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person, KFI gives Acquirer written notice of the identity of such Person and
of KFIs intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into
discussions or negotiations with, such Person, and KFI receives from such
Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations
on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral information
furnished to such Person by or on

 



54  behalf of KFI and (4) at least two (2) Business Days prior to furnishing any
such nonpublic information to such Person, KFI furnishes such nonpublic
information to Acquirer (to the extent such nonpublic information has not
been previously furnished by KFI to Acquirer). Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, KFI acknowledges and agrees that any violation of or the
taking of any action inconsistent with any of the restrictions set forth in
the preceding sentence by KFI, KleinBank, their respective Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Representatives will be deemed to constitute a breach of
this Section 5.8(a) by KFI.

 

(b) KFI will promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest
that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal) advise Acquirer orally
and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or indication of
interest that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal relating to
KFI or KleinBank (including the identity of the Person making or submitting
such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request, and
the terms thereof) that is made or submitted by any Person prior to the
Closing Date. KFI will keep Acquirer fully informed with respect to the status
of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request
and any modification or proposed modification thereto.

(c) KFI and KleinBank will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions with any Person that relate to any Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) KFI will not release or permit the release of any Person from, or waive or
permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill" or
similar agreement to which KFI is a party, and will enforce or cause to be
enforced each such agreement at the request of Acquirer. KFI will promptly
request each Person that has executed, within twelve (12) months prior to the
date of this Agreement, a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of a possible Acquisition Transaction or equity investment to
return all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or
on behalf of KFI.

5.9 _Maintenance of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses_. KFI will cause
KleinBank to maintain the ALLL of KleinBank in compliance with GAAP and
Regulatory Accounting Principles and KleinBanks existing methodology for
determining the adequacy of the ALLL, as well as the standards established by
all applicable Governmental Entities and GAAP.

5.10 _KFI Forbearances_. Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement or
with the prior written consent of Acquirer (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article 8, KFI will not, and will not permit any
KFI Subsidiary, except as may be required by applicable Law, any Governmental
Order or policies imposed by any Governmental Entity, to (a) take any action
that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
take, or omit to take, any action that is

 



55  reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth
in Article 7 not being or becoming not capable of being satisfied or (c) take
any action that would render, or that reasonably would be expected to render,
any representation or warranty made by KFI in this Agreement untrue at the
Closing as though then made and as though the Closing Date had been
substituted for the date of this Agreement in such representation or
warranty.

ARTICLE 6

 

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

 

6.1 _The Bank Merger_. To the extent not previously approved, KFI will cause
the board of directors of KleinBank to approve the Bank Merger Agreement and
the Bank Merger promptly after the execution of this Agreement, and will vote
all of the shares of KleinBank Common Stock held by KFI in favor of approval
of the Bank Merger Agreement and the Bank Merger. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Bank Merger will occur simultaneously with the Merger, and will be
conditioned upon regulatory approval and upon the Required KFI Shareholder
Vote.

 

6.2 _Filings and Regulatory Approvals_. Acquirer will use all commercially
reasonable efforts to prepare and file no later than thirty (30) days after
the date of this Agreement all applications and other documents required to
obtain Regulatory Approvals and consents from OCC and the MDC for the Bank
Merger and waiver or approval, if required, of the FRB of the Merger. KFI
will cooperate with Acquirer in the preparation and filing of all such
applications and other documents. Prior to filing each application or other
document with the applicable Governmental Entity, Acquirer will promptly
provide KFI with an opportunity to review and comment on the non-confidential
portions of each such application or other document. Each party to this
Agreement will use all commercially reasonable efforts and will
cooperate with the other party in taking any other actions necessary to
obtain such regulatory or other approvals and consents, including
participating in any required hearings or proceedings. Subject to the terms
and conditions herein provided, each party will use all commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Acquirer will pay, or will cause to be paid, any applicable
fees and expenses (other than the fees and expenses of KFIs counsel) in
connection with the preparation and filing of such regulatory filings
necessary to obtain the Regulatory Approvals.

6.3 _Shareholder Meeting; Registration Statement_.

 

(a) KFI will call a special meeting of its shareholders (the " _KFI
Shareholder Meeting_ ") for the purpose of voting upon this Agreement and the
Merger, and will schedule such meeting based on consultation with Acquirer as
soon as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective.
The board of directors of KFI will recommend that the shareholders approve
this Agreement and the Merger (the " _KFI Board Recommendation_ "), and KFI
will use its best efforts (including soliciting proxies for such approval) to
obtain the Required KFI Shareholder Vote. In connection with the KFI
Shareholder Meeting and the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereunder by the holders of KFI Common Stock, KFI will distribute
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to all holders of KFI Common Stock. The KFI
Board 

 



56  Recommendation may not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
Acquirer, and no resolution by the board of directors of KFI or any committee
thereof to withdraw or modify the KFI Board Recommendation in a manner
adverse to KFI may be adopted; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding
the foregoing, prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required KFI
Shareholder Vote, the board of directors of KFI may withdraw, qualify or
modify the KFI Board Recommendation or approve, adopt, recommend or otherwise
declare advisable any Superior Proposal made after the date hereof, if the
board of directors of KFI determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that failure to do so would be likely to result in a breach
of fiduciary duties under applicable Law (a " _Change of KFI Board
Recommendation_ "). In determining whether to make a Change of KFI Board
Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or otherwise, the board of
directors of KFI will take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Acquirer or any other information provided by Acquirer
in response to such notice.

 

(b) For the purposes of (i) holding the KFI Shareholder Meeting and (ii)
registering Acquirer Common Stock to be issued to shareholders of KFI in
connection with the Merger with the SEC and with applicable state securities
authorities, Acquirer will prepare, with the cooperation of KFI (which will,
for the avoidance of doubt, be given the opportunity to participate in the
preparation of the Registration Statement and will have the right to approve
the content of the Registration Statement relating to KFI and KleinBank), a
registration statement on Form S-4 (such registration statement, together
with all and any amendments and supplements thereto, being herein referred to
as the " _Registration Statement_ "), which will include a proxy
statement/prospectus satisfying all applicable requirements of the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act and applicable Blue Sky Laws (such proxy
statement/prospectus, together with any and all amendments or supplements
thereto, being herein referred to as the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ").

(c) Acquirer will furnish such information concerning Acquirer and its
Subsidiaries as is necessary in order to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and the Registration Statement, insofar as they relate to Acquirer and its
Subsidiaries, to be prepared in accordance with Section 6.3(b). Acquirer
agrees promptly to notify KFI if at any time prior to the KFI Shareholder
Meeting any information provided by Acquirer in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
becomes incorrect or incomplete in any material respect, and to provide the
information needed to correct such inaccuracy or omission.

(d) KFI will promptly furnish Acquirer with such information concerning KFI,
KleinBank and their respective Subsidiaries as is necessary in order to cause
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement, insofar as they
relate to KFI, KleinBank or their respective Subsidiaries, to be prepared in
accordance with Section 6.3(b), including the opinion of counsel as to Tax
matters required to be filed as an exhibit thereto. KFI agrees promptly to
notify Acquirer if at any time prior to the KFI Shareholder Meeting any
information provided by KFI in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
becomes incorrect or incomplete in any material respect, and to provide
Acquirer with the information needed to correct such inaccuracy or omission.

 



57 (e) Within forty-five (45) days after the execution of this
Agreement, Acquirer will file the Registration Statement with the SEC and
applicable state securities agencies. Acquirer will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause (i) the Registration Statement to become effective
under the Securities Act and applicable Blue Sky Laws at the earliest
practicable date and (ii) the shares of Acquirer Common Stock issuable to the
shareholders of KFI to be authorized for listing on the NASDAQ or other
national securities exchange. At the time the Registration Statement becomes
effective, Acquirer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that the Registration Statement complies in all material respects with the
provisions of the Securities Act and applicable Blue Sky Laws. KFI hereby
authorizes Acquirer to utilize in the Registration Statement the information
concerning KFI, KleinBank and their respective Subsidiaries provided to
Acquirer for the purpose of inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
Acquirer will advise KFI promptly when the Registration Statement has become
effective and of any supplements or amendments thereto, and Acquirer will
furnish KFI with copies of all such documents. Prior to the Effective Time or
the termination of this Agreement, each party will consult with the other with
respect to any material (other than the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) that might
constitute a "prospectus" relating to the Merger within the meaning of the
Securities Act.

(f) Acquirer agrees that none of the information relating to Acquirer and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by Acquirer for inclusion in: (i) the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, any filings or approvals under applicable federal or
state banking Laws or regulations or Blue Sky Laws, or any filing pursuant to
the Securities Act will, at the time of mailing the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to KFIs shareholders, at the time of the KFI Shareholder
Meeting and at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, and (ii) the Registration Statement will,
at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement
thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

6.4 _Establishment of Accruals_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, KFI shall and shall cause KFI Subsidiaries to
make, consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC and
applicable banking laws and regulations, such appropriate accounting entries
in its books and records and use commercially reasonable efforts to take such
other actions as KFI and KFI Subsidiaries shall deem to be necessary or
desirable in anticipation of the Merger including, without limitation,
accruals or the creation of reserves for employee benefits and Merger-related
expenses.

 

(b) KFI recognizes that Acquirer may have adopted different loan and
accounting policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels
of loan loss allowances). Subject to applicable Law (including without
limitation applicable banking laws and regulations and GAAP) and the
conditions in Section 6.4(d), from and after the date hereof KFI
shall consult and cooperate in good faith with Acquirer with respect to
conforming the loan and accounting policies and practices of KFI to those
policies and practices of Acquirer for financial accounting and/or income tax
reporting purposes, as reasonably specified in each case in writing from
Acquirer to KFI, based upon such consultation.

(c) Subject to applicable Law (including without limitation applicable
banking laws and regulations and GAAP) and the conditions in Section 6.4(d),
KFI shall consult and cooperate in good faith with Acquirer with respect to
determining, as reasonably specified in a written notice from Acquirer to
KFI, based upon such consultation, the amount and the timing for recognizing
for financial accounting and/or income tax reporting purposes of KFIs
expenses of the Merger.

 

(d) Subject to applicable Law (including without limitation applicable banking
laws and regulations and GAAP), KFI shall consult and cooperate in good faith
to (i) make such conforming entries to conform the loan and accounting
policies and practices of KFI to the policies and practices of Acquirer as
contemplated in Section 6.4(b) above and (ii) recognize KFIs expenses of the
Merger for financial accounting and/or income tax reporting purposes at such
times as are reasonably requested in writing by Acquirer as contemplated in
Section 6.4(c) above, but in no event prior to the fifth (5th) day next
preceding the Closing Date.

 



59 (e) KFIs representations, warranties and covenants contained in
this Agreement shall not be deemed to be untrue or breached in any respect
for any purpose as a consequence of any modifications or changes undertaken on
account of Section 6.4(d).

 

6.5 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _General_. At the request of Acquirer, and except as otherwise provided in
Section 6.5(c), KFI agrees to terminate any Plans as of the Effective Time in
accordance with their terms and subject to applicable Laws. If any Plans are
not so terminated, after the Effective Time, Acquirer will have the right to
continue, amend, merge or terminate any of such Plans in accordance with the
terms thereof and subject to any limitation arising under applicable Law,
including Tax qualification requirements. KFI agrees that, at the request of
Acquirer, KleinBank, KFI and any Commonly Controlled Entity will cease to be
a participating employer of, and will cease making contributions to or
otherwise providing benefits under, any Plan, as of the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, there are any Plans for which the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries continues to be a participating
employer, Acquirer will have the right to discontinue such participation in
any of such Plans in accordance with the terms thereof and subject to any
limitation arising under applicable Law. Until Acquirer will take such
action, however, such Plans will continue in force for the benefit of present
and former employees of either of KFI or KleinBank who have any present or
future entitlement to benefits under any of the Plans.

 

(b) _Termination of KFI 401(k)_. Unless Acquirer directs KFI otherwise in
writing, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
board of directors of KFI will adopt resolutions, effective immediately prior
to the Effective Date, (i) permanently discontinuing contributions to and
terminating the KFI 401(k) and (ii) amending the KFI 401(k), to the extent
necessary, to comply with all applicable Laws. Such resolutions will provide
that, as soon as administratively feasible following the Closing, but subject
to any applicable regulatory requirements and receipt of any necessary
regulatory approvals, the Surviving Corporation will direct the KFI 401(k) to
distribute each participants vested account balance in a single lump sum,
providing each participant the option of receiving their single lump
sum distribution or rolling over their vested account balance to Old National
Bancorp Employee Stock Ownership and Savings Plan. KFI will also take such
other actions in furtherance of the termination of the KFI 401(k) as Acquirer
may reasonably require.

(c) _Continuation of KFI Deferred Compensation Arrangements_. Effective as of
the Effective Time, KFI shall freeze the deferral amounts and deferral
elections of all participants in the KFI Deferred Compensation Arrangements
and allow no additional deferrals pursuant to such arrangements. Acquirer
agrees to leave the KFI Deferred Compensation Arrangements in place following
the Effective Time and assume and perform all obligations of KFI and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to such arrangements in accordance with the terms of
each such arrangement and consistent with past practices, except that Acquirer
may transfer such arrangements to Acquirers deferred compensation plan
administrator and, to the extent permitted under the applicable KFI

 



60  Deferred Compensation Arrangement, provide the investment options in
accordance with the related terms of Acquirers deferred compensation
arrangements. After the Effective Time, notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary, a KFI Deferred Compensation Arrangement may only be terminated with
the consent of each such KFI Deferred Compensation Arrangements participants.

 

(d) _Participation in Acquirer Benefit Plans_. Upon the later of the Closing
Date or the date upon which a former KFI employee is no longer covered by a
KFI Plan, each KFI employee will be eligible to participate in the health,
vacation and other non-equity based employee benefit plans of Acquirer or its
Subsidiaries (the  _"_ _Acquirer Plans_ _"_ ) to the same extent as similarly
situated employees of Acquirer and to the extent permitted by the applicable
Acquirer Plan or applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this Section 6.5(c) or elsewhere in this Agreement will limit the right of
Acquirer or any of its Subsidiaries to amend or terminate an Acquirer Plan at
any time. With respect to the Acquirer Plans, Acquirer will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to: (i) with respect to each
Acquirer Plan that is a medical/prescription, dental or vision plan, (x) waive
any exclusions for pre-existing conditions under such Acquirer Plan that
would result in a lack of coverage for any condition for which the applicable
KFI employee would have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding Plan
in which such KFI employee was an active participant immediately prior to his
or her transfer to Acquirer Plan; (y) waive any waiting period under such
Acquirer Plan, to the extent that such period exceeds the corresponding
waiting period under the corresponding Plan in which such KFI employee was an
active participant immediately prior to his or her transfer to Acquirer Plan
(after taking into account the service credit provided for herein for purposes
of satisfying such waiting period) and (z) provided the insurance company of
KFI or KleinBank provides information related to the amount of such credit
that is available to Acquirer, provide each KFI employee with credit for
deductibles paid by such KFI employee prior to his or her transfer to an
Acquirer Plan (to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous
Plan prior to such transfer) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-
of-pocket requirements under such Acquirer Plan for the plan year that
includes such transfer and (ii) fully recognize service of the KFI employees
with either KFI or KleinBank for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting credit, and, solely with respect to vacation and severance
benefits, benefit accrual in any Acquirer Plan in which the KFI employees are
eligible to participate after the Closing Date, to the extent that such
service was recognized for that purpose under the analogous Plan prior to such
transfer. Acquirer will extend coverage to KFI employees for health care,
dependent care and limited purpose health care flexible spending accounts
established under Section 125 of the Code to the same extent as available to
similarly situated employees of Acquirer to the extent permitted by such
Acquirer Plans and applicable Law. Acquirer will give effect to any elections
made by KFI employees with respect to such accounts under any flexible
benefits cafeteria plan of either KFI or KleinBank to the extent permitted by
such Acquirer Plan and applicable Law. KFI employees will be credited with
amounts available for reimbursement equal to such amounts as were credited
under any flexible benefits cafeteria plan of either KFI or KleinBank to the
extent permitted by such Acquirer Plan and applicable Law. The foregoing will
not apply to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits.

 



61 (e) _Terminated KFI Employees_. To the extent that Acquirer terminates
the employment of any KFI employee without "cause" (as such term is defined
in the sole discretion of Acquirer), at, or within six (6) months after, the
Effective Time, and such KFI employee is not otherwise entitled to severance
benefits under a separate contractual obligation with either KFI or KleinBank
in effect on the date of this Agreement, Acquirer will offer such KFI employee
severance benefits as provided in the Old National Bancorp Severance Pay Plan,
a copy of which has been provided to KFI.

(f) _KFI Employee Retention Program_. Prior to the Effective Time, KFI and
Acquirer will mutually agree on and establish an employee retention bonus
program in the aggregate amount set forth on Schedule 6.5(f) and will allocate
pursuant to such program cash awards to certain KFI employees to remain in the
employ of one of KFI, KleinBank and Acquirer Bank, for non-customer contact
employees through the completion of the Closing Date or within sixty (60) days
following the systems integration between KFI and KleinBank, on the
one hand, and Acquirer and Acquirer Bank, on the other hand and for other
employees through such date as Acquirer may reasonably establish for such
employees.

 

(g) _Transaction-Related Incentives_. On the Closing Date, KFI will pay the
transaction-related incentives for designated employees of KFI in the amounts
set forth in the agreements described on Schedule 6.5(g).

(h) _Employment Agreements and Incentives_. As of the Effective Time,
Acquirer shall assume the change in control and other employment agreements
between KFI and its Subsidiaries and their respective employees listed in the
KFI Disclosure Schedule. On the Closing Date, KFI will pay any amounts owing
but not yet paid under any employee incentive compensation and bonus plan of
KFI or its Subsidiaries listed in the KFI Disclosure Schedule, in the amounts
accrued for payment under such plans as of the Closing Date.

 

(i) _Affordable Care Act Reporting_. As required under the Affordable Care
Act, KFI, KleinBank and each Commonly Controlled Entity will accurately
complete and timely file with the IRS, and timely send to all covered
individuals, as applicable, any required IRS Forms 1094-B, 1095-B, 1094-C and
1095-C and all other associated or supplemental forms or notices for the 2018
calendar year with respect to each Benefit Plan that is subject to the
Affordable Care Act.

(j) _Limitation on Enforcement_. This Agreement is an agreement solely
between KFI and Acquirer. Nothing in this Agreement, including this Section
6.5, whether express or implied, confers upon any KFI employees, employees of
Acquirer and its Subsidiaries or any other Person, any rights or remedies,
including: (i) any right to employment or recall, (ii) any right to continued
employment for any specified period or (iii) any right to any particular
compensation, benefit or aggregate of benefits, or any other term
or condition of employment, of any kind or nature whatsoever.

 



62 6.6 _Tax Treatment_. Neither KFI, KleinBank nor Acquirer will take any
action that would disqualify the Merger as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code.

6.7 _ Updated Schedules_. KFI and Acquirer shall promptly supplement, amend
and update, upon the occurrence of any change prior to the Effective Time and
as of the Effective Time, the KFI Disclosure Schedule and the Acquirer
Disclosure Schedule, respectively, or add any schedule or schedules, with
respect to any matters or events hereafter arising or to correct any
misstatement or omission which, if in existence or having occurred as of the
date of this Agreement, are required to be set forth for the purpose of
making the representations and warranties to which any such schedule relates
true and correct in all material respects, if existing or known as of the date
hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any updated schedule will not have the
effect of making any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
true and correct in all material respects for purposes of Sections 7.2(a) and
7.3(a) respectively. No such supplement, amendment or update shall become part
of the KFI Disclosure Schedule or the Acquirer Disclosure Schedule unless
Acquirer or KFI, respectively, shall have first consented in writing with
respect thereto.

 

6.8 _Indemnification_ _; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) Acquirer agrees that all rights of the present and former directors and
officers of either KFI or KleinBank to indemnification provided for in the
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or other governing documents of KFI or
KleinBank, as applicable, as in effect on the date hereof, or required under
any applicable Law (including rights to advancement of expenses and
exculpation), and that all such rights of the present and former directors and
officers of KFI and KleinBank (to the extent such rights to indemnification
are required) will survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms to the extent permitted by Law, and shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, for
a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time (each such director,
officer and employee being sometimes hereinafter referred to as an "
_Indemnified Party_ "). The Surviving Corporation will indemnify any Person
made a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that such Person was a
director or officer of either KFI or KleinBank at or prior to the Effective
Time to the fullest extent provided in, and will advance expenses in
accordance with, the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and other governing
documents of KFI or KleinBank, as applicable, in the form previously provided
to Acquirer and effective as of the date of this Agreement, in each case
subject to all the limitations set forth in such Articles of Incorporation,
Bylaws or other governing documents and applicable Law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.8, nothing contained in
this Agreement will require Acquirer to indemnify, defend or hold harmless
any Indemnified Party to a greater extent than either of KFI or KleinBank may,
as of the date of this Agreement, indemnify, defend and hold harmless such
Indemnified Party, and any such indemnification provided pursuant to this
Section 6.8 will be provided only to the extent that such indemnification is
permitted by any applicable federal or state Laws.

 



63 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, KFI will or, if KFI is unable to, Acquirer as
of the Effective Time will, obtain a "tail" insurance policy with a claims
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance (collectively, " _D
andO Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable to
the Indemnified Parties as the existing policies of KFI and KleinBank with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or
actions contemplated hereby). Acquirer will pay the premium for such DandO
Insurance tail policy provided that in no event will Acquirer by required to
expend more than an amount per year equal to 200% of the annual premiums paid
by KFI as of the Effective Time for such insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_
") provided, however, that if the cost exceeds such limit, Acquirer will use
its reasonable efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available
for the Insurance Amount.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party as if he or she were a
party to this Agreement.

 

6.9 _Acquirer Confidential Information_. Any confidential information or trade
secrets of each of Acquirer and its Subsidiaries received by either KFI,
KleinBank or their respective Subsidiaries, or their respective employees or
agents in the course of the negotiation and consummation of the Merger or Bank
Merger will be treated confidentially and held in confidence pursuant to the
NDA, and any correspondence, memoranda, records, copies, documents and
electronic or other media of any kind containing either such confidential
information or trade secrets or both will be destroyed by KFI, KleinBank and
their respective Subsidiaries or, at Acquirers request, returned to Acquirer
if this Agreement is terminated as provided in Article 8\. Such information
will be maintained and held in compliance with the NDA.

 

6.10 _Environmental_. If requested by Acquirer within sixty (60) days of this
Agreement, KFI will cooperate with an environmental consulting firm
designated by Acquirer (and reasonably acceptable to KFI) in connection with
the conduct by such firm of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (in
accordance with a written scope of work approved by the parties using the
current ASTM standard Phase I standard E1527-13) on all real property owned or
leased by KFI or any KFI Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement, and any
real property acquired or leased by KFI or any KFI Subsidiary before the
Closing Date. If any Phase I report discloses any current Recognized
Environmental Conditions (" _REC_ ", as defined under the ASTM standard), the
parties will consult and determine whether a Phase II assessment is
recommended based on the finding of an REC. Acquirer shall have the right to
have a Phase II environmental assessment performed on such real property. The
parties shall enter into a reasonable temporary site access agreement prior
to any environmental site assessment work at any property. Acquirer shall be
responsible for the cost of the Phase I assessments, Acquirer shall be
responsible for the cost of any Phase II assessments of property leased by
KFI, and KFI and Acquirer shall each be responsible for 50% of the cost of
any Phase II assessments of property owned by KFI. Acquirer shall return the
properties to the same condition as present prior to their performance of any
environmental site assessment work at the properties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, KFIs obligations under this paragraph and the performance of any
Phase I or II assessments, shall be subject to and limited by the terms and
conditions of the lease agreements applicable to any leased properties and
the receipt of all appropriate lessor consents.

 



64 If the environmental consultants good faith estimate, based upon the results
of the Phase I or Phase II environmental site assessment work completed under
this Agreement, of the dollar amount, if any, that KFI and KFI Subsidiaries
would reasonably be required to expend under the terms of the applicable lease
or applicable Environmental Laws for clean-up, remediation and penalties
relating to pollutants, contaminants, wastes, toxic substances, petroleum,
petroleum products and any other materials regulated under the Environmental
Laws with respect to KFIs or KFI Subsidiaries owned or leased real
properties or any adjoining properties, is in excess of $3,000,000 in the
aggregate, then Acquirer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(iii), which termination shall be Acquirers sole
remedy in such event.

(a) by mutual consent of the boards of directors of Acquirer and KFI;

 

(b) by either party:

 



68 (i) if a Law or Governmental Order will have been enacted, entered,

given by KFI to Acquirer;

(ii) (A) KFI will have delivered to Acquirer a written notice of the intent
of KFI to enter into a merger, acquisition or other agreement (including an
agreement in principle) to effect a Superior Proposal based on an Acquisition
Proposal received by it, (B) five (5) Business Days have elapsed
following delivery to Acquirer of such written notice by KFI, (C) during such
five (5) Business Day period, KFI has fully complied with the terms of Section
5.8, including informing Acquirer of the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal, with the intent of enabling Acquirer to agree to a modification of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be effected, (D) at the end of such five (5) Business

69 _subject_ , _however_ , to the following three sentences. If KFI elects to
exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(iii), it shall
give prompt written notice thereof to Acquirer. During the five (5) Business
Day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, Acquirer shall have the
option to increase the Exchange Ratio to equal the quotient determined by
dividing the Initial Acquirer Market Value by the Acquirer Market Value on the
Calculation Date, and multiplying the quotient by the product of the Exchange
Ratio (as then in effect) and 0.85. If within such five (5) Business Day
period, Acquirer delivers written notice to KFI that it intends to proceed
with the Merger by paying such additional consideration as contemplated by the
preceding sentence, and notifies KFI of the revised Exchange Ratio, then no
termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(iii), and this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms
(except that the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified). For purposes of
clarification, the adjustments to the Exchange Ratio contemplated by Section
2.6 of this Agreement shall be calculated and applied subsequent to any
adjustment to the Exchange Ratio pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(iii). 

For purposes of this Section 8.1(c)(iii), the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated below:

 

" _Acquirer Market Value_ " means the Volume Weighted Average Price of a share
of Acquirer Common Stock for the period ending on the day immediately
preceding the Calculation Date.

" _Calculation Date_ " shall mean the first date on which all Regulatory
Approvals (and waivers, if applicable) necessary for consummation of the
Merger have been received (disregarding any waiting period).

 

" _Initial Acquirer Market Value_ " means $18.53, adjusted as indicated in the
last sentence of this Section 8.1(c)(iii).

If Acquirer declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction between the date of this Agreement and the Calculation Date, the
prices for the common stock of such company shall be appropriately adjusted
for the purposes of applying this Section 8.1(c)(iii).

(iv) any of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.2 will have become
impossible to satisfy (other than through a failure of KFI to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement); or

(d) by Acquirer if:

(i) KFI will have breached any representation, warranty or agreement in this
Agreement in any material respect and such breach would give rise to a
failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.3, and such condition is
incapable of being satisfied by the Termination Date or has not been cured by
KFI within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach is given by
Acquirer to KFI;

 



70 (ii) There has been a Material Adverse Effect on KFI on a consolidated basis
as of the Effective Time, as compared to that in existence on the date of
this Agreement;

(iii) Acquirer elects to exercise its right to terminate pursuant to Section
6.10;

(iv) If the KFI board of directors shall fail to include its recommendation
to approve the Merger in the proxy statement/prospectus;

(A) in the event of a Change of KFI Board Recommendation;

(B) if the KFI board of directors shall approve any Acquisition Proposal or
publicly recommend that the holders of KFI Common Stock accept or approve any
Acquisition Proposal;

(C) if KFI shall have entered into, or publicly announced its intention to
enter into, a definitive agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; or

 

(D) if the KFI board of directors fails to publicly reaffirm its
recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement within five (5) Business Days of a written
request by Acquirer to provide such reaffirmation; or

 

(v) if a quorum could not be convened at the meeting of shareholders of KFI
contemplated in Section 6.3 or at a reconvened meeting held at any time prior
to or on the Termination Date.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. Except as provided in Sections 8.3 and 8.4 and
any provisions set forth herein that survive the termination of this
Agreement, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, this
Agreement will forthwith become void, there will be no Liability under this
Agreement on the part of Acquirer, KFI or any of their respective
Representatives or Subsidiaries, and all rights and obligations of each party
hereto will cease; _provided, however_ , that, subject to Sections 8.3 and
8.4, nothing herein will relieve any party from Liability arising out of its
own fraud, willful misconduct or intentional breach of this Agreement.

 

8.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all Expenses

KFI Common Stock and all other matters related to the consummation of the
Merger.

 



71 8.4 _Termination Fee_ _s_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(iii) as a result of the failure to obtain any of the Bank Regulatory
Approvals and such failure is a result of a regulatory issue directly and
solely related to Acquirer, Acquirer shall pay to KFI an amount in cash equal
to $2,000,000 (the " _KFI Termination Fee_ ").

 

(b) KFI shall pay to Acquirer an amount in cash equal to $17,078,724 (the "
_Acquirer Termination Fee_ ") if:

 

(i) This Agreement is terminated by Acquirer pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(iv);

 

(ii) This Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(ii) or Section 8.1(d)(v) and, in each case, prior to the date that is
twelve (12) months after such termination KFI or KleinBank enters into any
Acquisition Agreement or any Acquisition Proposal is consummated (regardless
of whether such Acquisition Proposal is made or consummated before or after
termination of this Agreement);

(iii) This Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(iii) and (A) prior to the date of such termination, an Acquisition
Proposal was made, and (B) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after
such termination, KFI or KleinBank enters into any Acquisition Agreement or
any Acquisition Proposal is consummated; or

(iv) This Agreement is terminated by KFI pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iii).

(c) Any Termination Fee due under this Section 8.4 shall be paid by wire

Section 8.4(b)(ii) or (iii)), on the date KFI enters into such Acquisition
Agreement or consummates such Acquisition Proposal.

(d) In the event that either party owes the Termination Fee pursuant to
this Section 8.4, then the payment of such amount shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for those termination events and shall constitute liquidated
damages. The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section
8.4 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the parties would not have entered into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if either party fails to promptly pay the amounts
due pursuant to this Section 8.4, and, in order to obtain such payment, a
party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other party for
the amounts set forth in this Section 8.4, in addition to the amount of such
judgment, the prevailing party shall be paid its reasonable costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit
and any appeal relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts set

such payment was required to be made.

in writing approved by the parties to this Agreement and signed on behalf of
each of the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquirer may, in its
sole discretion, amend Sections 4.17 and 5.1 to increase any of the dollar
thresholds contained in those sections or to relax any other requirements in
those sections in order to obtain the Regulatory Approvals.

8.6  _Waiver_. The parties hereto may by an instrument in writing: (i) extend
the time for the performance of or otherwise amend any of the covenants,
conditions or agreements of the other parties under this Agreement; (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations or warranties of the other
parties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto or thereto; (iii) waive the performance by the other parties of any of
the covenants or agreements to be performed by it or them under this
Agreement or (iv) waive the satisfaction or fulfillment of any condition, the
nonsatisfaction or nonfulfillment of which is a condition to the right of the
party so waiving to consummate the Merger. The waiver by any party hereto of
a breach of or noncompliance with any provision of this Agreement will not
operate or be construed as a continuing waiver or a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach or noncompliance hereunder.

74 9.3 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned by any party to this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties to this
Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement and all of the provisions
of this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted

9.4  _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise provided in Section
6.8(c), nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement confers any rights
or remedies upon any Person that is not a party or permitted assign of a party
to this Agreement.

9.5 _Schedules_.

 

(a) Prior to or simultaneous with the execution of this Agreement, KFI
delivered to Acquirer the KFI Disclosure Schedule, which set forth, among
other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either
in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision
hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in Article 4 or to one or more covenants contained
herein (whether or not such section of this Agreement expressly references a
schedule thereto). Except as set forth in the Acquirer Disclosure Schedule or
KFI Disclosure Schedule, the information contained therein is dated as of the
close of business on the Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement or,
if delivered pursuant to Section 6.7, as of such date delivered.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the mere
inclusion of an item as an exception to a representation or warranty will not
be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would
be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. In the event of any
inconsistency between the statements in this Agreement and statements in the
Acquirer or KFI Disclosure Schedule, the statements in this Agreement will
control and the statements in the Acquirer or KFI Disclosure Schedule will be
disregarded.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, a schedule relating to a certain section
may incorporate by reference disclosures made in other schedules; _provided,
however,_ that any disclosure with respect to a particular schedule or section
will be deemed adequately disclosed in other schedules or sections to the
extent it is readily and reasonably apparent from the nature of the disclosure
that such disclosure also applies to such other schedules or sections.

 

9.6 _Interpretation_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. References to Sections and Articles refer to
Sections and Articles of this Agreement unless otherwise stated. Words such as

Agreement, the masculine, feminine and neuter genders will be deemed to
include the others if the context requires. Any singular term in this
Agreement will be deemed to include the plural, and any plural term the
singular if the context requires. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by
the words "but

 



75  not limited to," whether or not they are in fact followed by those words or
words of like import. "Writing", "written" and comparable terms refer to
printing, typing and other means of reproducing words (including electronic
media) in a visible form. Any reference to any money or currency or use of "$"
will be in U.S. dollars. Except as the context may otherwise require,

supplemented from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof and
thereof; provided that with respect to any Contract listed on any schedules
hereto, all such amendments, modifications or supplements must also be listed
in the appropriate schedule. References to a statute will be to such statute,
as amended from time to time, and to the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. References to any Person include the successors and permitted
assigns of that Person. References from or through any date mean, unless
otherwise specified, from and including or through and including,
respectively.

 

9.7 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties will
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement and to preserve each partys
anticipated benefits under this Agreement.

9.8  _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement and the Exhibits hereto, together
with the Ancillary Documents, contain the complete agreement between the
parties and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations
by or between the parties, written or oral. Each party to this Agreement
acknowledges that its respective counterparty has made no representations,
warranties, agreements, undertakings or promises except for those expressly
set forth in this Agreement or in any of the Ancillary Documents to which
each is a party. The parties hereto agree that each party and its counsel
reviewed and revised this Agreement and that the normal rule of construction
to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting
party will not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement or any
amendments or exhibits hereto.

9.9  _Governing Law_. THE DOMESTIC LAW, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS
PRINCIPLES, OF THE STATE OF INDIANA WILL GOVERN ALL QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE
CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND INTERPRETATION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
PERFORMANCE OF THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

9.10 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to
the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States of America located in
Indiana solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, and in respect of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and hereby waive, and agree
not to assert, as a defense in any Litigation relating to the interpretation
or enforcement of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Documents, that
either of such parties is not subject thereto or that such Litigation may not
be brought or is not maintainable in such courts or that the venue thereof may
not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any Ancillary Document may not be
enforced in or by such courts. The parties hereto irrevocably agree that all
claims with respect to such Litigation will be heard and determined in such
courts. The parties

 



76  hereby consent to and grant any such courts jurisdiction over such parties
and over the subject matter of such dispute, and agree that mailing of process
or other papers in connection with any such Litigation in the manner provided
in Section 9.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law, will be
valid and sufficient service thereof.

 

9.11 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that
the subject matter of this Agreement, including the business, assets and
properties of each of KFI, KleinBank and their respective Subsidiaries, is
unique, that the other party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of
the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached, and that the remedies at Law would
not be adequate to compensate such other parties not in default or in breach.
Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that the other party will be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in addition to any other remedy to which they may
be entitled, at Law or in equity (without any requirement that Acquirer or
KFI provide any bond or other security). The parties waive any defense that a
remedy at Law is adequate and any requirement to post bond or provide similar
security in connection with actions instituted for injunctive relief or
specific performance of this Agreement.

9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.12.

 

9.13 _Investigation of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. No
investigation made by or on behalf of the parties hereto or the results of
any such investigation will constitute a waiver of any representation,
warranty or covenant of any other party.

 

9.14 _No Survival of Representations_. The representations, warranties and
covenants made by KFI and Acquirer in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement will terminate on, and will have no
further force or effect after, the first to occur of (a) the Effective Time or
(b) the date on which this Agreement is terminated as set forth herein, and
thereafter Acquirer, KFI and all the respective directors, officers and
employees of Acquirer and KFI will have no further liability with respect
thereto. The covenants contained in Sections 8.3 and 8.4 shall survive
the termination of this Agreement. The covenants contained in Section 6.8
shall survive the termination of the Effective Time.

 



77 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed on the date first written above.

G-1 _FORM OF TAX INDEMNITY LETTER_

 

 _ ,_ 2018

Re: Merger of Klein Financial, Inc. and Old National Bancorp--Tax Distribution
Indemnification Amount 

Dear [ _ _:

 

Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June __, 2018 (the
"Merger Agreement"), by and between Old National Bancorp ("Acquirer") and
Klein Financial, Inc. ("KFI"), KFI will be merged with and into Acquirer,
effective as of [date].

 

Pursuant to Section 5.7 of the Merger Agreement, KFI is not permitted to pay
cash distributions after the date of the Merger Agreement to cover income tax
liabilities related to your allocated federal and state taxable income in
connection with your ownership of KFI Common Stock ("Tax Distributions").
Acquirer understands and acknowledges that, as a result of KFI not paying Tax
Distributions for the remainder of 2018 tax year, you have not received funds
from KFI to pay quarterly estimated taxes as required by applicable federal
and state law and your failure to pay quarterly estimated taxes may result in
the imposition of penalties and interest charges.

Acquirer agrees to indemnify you for all penalties, interest or additions to
tax assessed to you as a result of a failure to pay estimated taxes on a
timely basis in the amounts due in connection with the allocated components of
your KFI 2018 federal and state taxable income (the "Tax Distribution
Indemnification Amount"). Acquirer will pay the Tax Distribution
Indemnification Amount to you no later than five days after receipt from you
of the certifications described in the following paragraph. Acquirer will not
pay any penalties, interest or additions to tax assessed to you as a result
of a failure to pay estimated taxes on a timely basis with respect to taxable
income unrelated to KFI, or if you failed to timely make the appropriate
estimated tax payments in 2018 related to tax distributions from KFI with
respect to the April 17, 2018 and June 15, 2018 estimated tax payments.

You must prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, your federal
and state income tax returns for 2018 in accordance with your past practice
(to the extent such past practice complies with applicable law). If penalties,
interest or any additions to tax attributable to the failure to pay estimated
taxes in a timely manner in connection with the allocated components of your
KFI 2018 taxable income are reported on the income tax returns as due and
payable, you must provide to Acquirer a written certification of the Tax
Distribution Indemnification Amount. If, after filing the relevant income tax
returns, you receive notice of assessment from the tax authorities that any
additional penalties, interest or additions to tax attributable to failure to
pay 2018 estimated taxes in a timely manner relating to KFI 2018 taxable
income are due and payable, Shareholder shall provide to Acquirer a written
certification of this additional Tax Distribution Indemnification Amount. In
each case, your certification as 

 



G-2  to the amount due shall be conclusive absent manifest error and include a
certification that you (i) timely made the appropriate estimated tax payments
in 2018 related to tax distributions from KFI with respect to the April 17,
2018 and June 15, 2018 estimated tax payments and (ii) made good faith efforts
to minimize any penalties, interest and additions to tax assessed and to
minimize any estimated quarterly estimated tax payments after June 15, 2018
related to KFI taxable income. Acquirer may only object to the payment of the
Tax Distribution Indemnification Amount in the event that Acquirer disputes an
aggregate amount of $100,000 or greater with respect to the Tax Distribution
Indemnification Amount for all shareholders of KFI.

This letter summarizes the understanding and agreement of the Acquirer and
you regarding the Tax Distribution Indemnification Amount. If you agree to the
terms set forth in this letter please sign as indicated below and return the
signed letter to the Acquirer at the address set forth above.

    Very truly yours,
