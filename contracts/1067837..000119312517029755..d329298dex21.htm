v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 2, 2017 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is by and among CBS Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("
_CBS_ "), CBS Radio Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of CBS (" _Radio_ "), Entercom Communications Corp., a Pennsylvania
corporation (" _Acquiror_ "), and Constitution Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror (" _Merger Sub_ ").

 

WHEREAS, CBS presently directly owns 100% of the equity of Westinghouse CBS
Holding Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Westinghouse_ "),
Westinghouse presently directly owns 100% of the equity of CBS Broadcasting
Inc., a New York corporation (" _CBS Broadcasting_ "), and CBS Broadcasting
presently directly owns 100% of the equity of Radio;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, CBS and Radio are
entering into a Separation Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
A_ (the " _Separation Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, among other things,
prior to or on the Distribution Date, (a) CBS Broadcasting will distribute all
of the outstanding equity of Radio to Westinghouse (the " _First
Distribution_ "); (b) Westinghouse will distribute all of the outstanding
equity of Radio to CBS (the " _Second Distribution_ " and, together with the
First Distribution, the " _Internal Distributions_ "); and (c) Radio shall
effect the Stock Split (together with the Internal Distributions, the " _Radio
Reorganization_ "), in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and the Separation Agreement;

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Separation Agreement, following the consummation of
the Internal Distributions, on the Distribution Date, (i) CBS will consummate
an offer to exchange (the " _Exchange Offer_ ") all of the outstanding shares
of Radio Common Stock for shares of CBS Class B Common Stock then outstanding
and (ii) in the event that holders of CBS Class B Common Stock subscribe for
less than all of the shares of Radio Common Stock in the Exchange Offer, CBS
will distribute the remaining outstanding shares of Radio Common Stock on a
_pro_   _rata_ basis to holders of CBS Common Stock whose shares of CBS
Common Stock remain outstanding after consummation of the Exchange Offer, so
that CBS will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as having
distributed all of the Radio Common Stock to its stockholders (the " _Clean-
Up Spin-Off_"), considering, for the purposes of calculating the _pro_ _rata_
distribution of Radio Common Stock pursuant to any Clean-Up Spin-Off, the CBS
Class A Common Stock and CBS Class B Common Stock as a single class
(collectively, the " _Final Distribution_ " and together with the Internal
Distributions, the " _Distributions_ "), in each case on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Separation Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, following the Final Distribution, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
will be merged with and into Radio, with Radio continuing as the surviving
corporation and wholly owned Subsidiary of Acquiror, and all outstanding
shares of Radio Common Stock will be converted into shares of Acquirors
common stock, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the Merger, Acquiror shall contribute all of
the issued and outstanding equity interests of Entercom Radio, LLC to Radio,
such that Entercom Radio, LLC shall become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Radio
(the " _Contribution_ "); WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Acquiror (the " _Acquiror Board_ ") (a)
has determined that the Merger and this Agreement are advisable, fair to, and
in the best interests of, Acquiror and its shareholders and has approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and
the issuance of shares of Acquiror Class A Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger, and (b) has recommended the approval by the shareholders of Acquiror
of the issuance of shares of Acquiror Class A Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger;

 

WHEREAS, (a) the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has determined that the
Merger and this Agreement are advisable and has approved this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger; and (b) Acquiror,
in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has determined that the
Merger and this Agreement are advisable and has approved this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

WHEREAS, (a) the Divestiture Committee (the " _CBS Divestiture Committee_ ")
of the Board of Directors of CBS (the " _CBS Board_ ") has approved this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to which any member of the CBS
Group will be party and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Radio Reorganization, the Final Distribution and the Merger; (b)
the Board of Directors of Radio (the " _Radio Board_ ") has determined that
the Merger and this Agreement are advisable, fair to, and in the best
interests of Radio and its sole stockholder and has approved this Agreement
and the other Transaction Agreements to which Radio will be party and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Radio
Reorganization, the Final Distribution and the Merger; and (c) CBS
Broadcasting, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Radio, has determined
that the Merger and this Agreement are advisable and has approved this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to which Radio will be party
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger;

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Joseph Field is
entering into the voting and support agreement (the " _Voting Agreement_ ")
attached hereto to, among other things, provide for the voting of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock in favor of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Voting
Agreement;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Acquiror is
entering into a side letter (the " _Side Letter_ ") with certain holders of
Acquiror Common Stock, in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
H_ ;

 

WHEREAS, the Parties to this Agreement intend that, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, (a) each of the Distributions will qualify as a tax-free
transaction under Section 355 of the Code, and (b) the Merger will qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; and

 

WHEREAS, the Parties to this Agreement intend this Agreement to be, and hereby
adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3.

shall be paid to the record holder of such shares of Acquiror Class A Common
Stock, without interest, (i) at the time of the distribution, the amount of
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Class A Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ and the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Acquiror Class A
Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date therefor, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to the distribution of such shares and a payment date subsequent to
the distribution of such shares payable with respect to such whole shares of
Acquiror Class A Common Stock. Acquiror shall deposit in the Exchange Fund all
such dividends and distributions.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Radio Common Stock_. All shares of
Acquiror Class A Common Stock issued in respect of shares of Radio Common

of all rights pertaining to such shares of Radio Common Stock.

available to the Agent that remains undistributed to the former holders of
Radio Common Stock after the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Acquiror, upon

shares of Acquiror Class A Common Stock in accordance with this _Article III_
shall thereafter look only to Acquiror for payment of their claim for
Acquiror Class A Common Stock and any dividends, distributions or cash in lieu
of fractional shares with respect to Acquiror Class A Common Stock (subject to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law).

(f) _No Liability_. Neither CBS, the Surviving Corporation, Acquiror, Merger

withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Radio Common Stock such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing
Authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the recipient.

Section 3.3 _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Acquiror Class A
Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Acquiror
Class A Common Stock that a holder of shares of Radio Common Stock would

as reasonably directed by CBS, and in no case later than ten (10) Business
Days after the Effective Time. The Agent shall make available the net proceeds
thereof, after deducting any required withholding Taxes and brokerage
charges, commissions and transfer Taxes, on a _pro_ _rata_ basis, without
interest, as soon as practicable to the holders of Radio Common Stock that
would otherwise be entitled to receive such fractional shares of Acquiror
Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger.

Section 3.4 _CBS Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _CBS Options_. Each CBS Option held by a Radio Employee that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into an Acquiror Option and shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and
conditions after the Effective Time as the terms and conditions applicable to
such CBS Option immediately prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ that
from and after the Effective Time:

(i) the number of shares of Acquiror Class A Common Stock subject to such
Acquiror Option, rounded down to the nearest whole share, shall be equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of CBS Common
Stock subject to such CBS Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
by (B) the Equity Award Adjustment Ratio; and

(ii) the per share exercise price of such Acquiror Option, rounded up to the
nearest whole cent, shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A)
the per share exercise price of such CBS Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (B) the Equity Award Adjustment Ratio;

 



26 _provided_ , _further_ , that the exercise price and the number of shares of
Acquiror Class A Common Stock subject to such option shall be determined in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Such
Acquiror Options shall remain subject to the same time vesting requirements as
the corresponding CBS Options.

 

(b) _CBS RSU Awards_. Each CBS RSU Award held by a Radio Employee that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted,
as of the Effective Time, into an Acquiror RSU Award and shall otherwise be
subject to the same terms and conditions (including with respect to dividend
equivalents) after the Effective Time as the terms and conditions applicable
to such CBS RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, with any awards
that are earned based on the achievement of performance goals and for which
the applicable performance goals have not been certified as of the Effective
Time, to be deemed earned as of immediately prior to the Effective Time at the
level set forth in _Section 3.4(b)_ of the CBS Disclosure Letter; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that from and after the Effective Time (i) the number of shares
of Acquiror Common Stock subject to such Acquiror RSU Award, rounded up to the
nearest whole share, shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A)
the number of shares of CBS Common Stock subject to such CBS RSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Equity Award Adjustment
Ratio and (ii) such Acquiror RSU Awards shall remain subject to the same time
vesting requirements as the corresponding CBS RSU Awards.

 

(c) _Miscellaneous_. CBS and Acquiror shall take any and all actions
reasonably necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 3.4_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of
the Effective Time, Acquiror shall prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement registering a number of shares of Acquiror Common
Stock necessary to fulfill Acquirors obligations under this _Section_ __ _
3.4_.

Section 3.5  _Determination of Net Adjustment_.

(a) Within two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, CBS shall
prepare and deliver to Acquiror a report setting forth an estimate, prepared
in good faith based on Radios and CBSs books and records and other
information available at the time, of (i) the Radio Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Indebtedness_ "), and (ii) the calculation by CBS of the Initial
Net Adjustment Amount, if any, which shall be prepared in a manner consistent
in all respects with the Sample Adjustment Statement, including the line items
set forth therein, in accordance with GAAP consistently applied with the
Radio Audited Financial Statements for the twelve (12) months ended December
31, 2015, in each case, subject to the adjustments set forth in the 

 



27  Sample Adjustment Statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") together with any
documentary materials used in the calculations thereof; in the event of any
inconsistencies between the Sample Adjustment Statement and GAAP, the Sample
Adjustment Statement shall prevail. If based on the Closing Statement, the
Initial Net Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then immediately prior to
the Closing, CBS shall contribute to Radio an amount in cash equal to such
Initial Net Adjustment Amount, and if, based on the Closing Statement, the
Initial Net Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then immediately prior to
the Closing, Radio shall distribute to CBS an amount in cash equal to the
absolute value of such Initial Net Adjustment Amount. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, in the event Radio is required to incur Indebtedness
to make a payment to CBS pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence such
amount shall be excluded from the calculation of the Radio Indebtedness as of
the Effective Time for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_.

 

(b) Within seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall
prepare and deliver to CBS a report that sets forth Acquirors good faith
calculation of (A) the Radio Indebtedness, (B) the Radio Working Capital, (C)
the GL Adjustment and (C) the Final Net Adjustment Amount, if any, which shall
be prepared in a manner consistent in all respects with the Sample Adjustment
Statement, including the line items set forth therein, and in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied with the Radio Audited Financial Statements for the
twelve (12) months ended December 31, 2015, in each case, subject to the
adjustments set forth in the Sample Adjustment Statement (the " _Radio Closing
Report_ "); in the event of any inconsistencies between the Sample Adjustment
Statement and GAAP, the Sample Adjustment Statement shall prevail. CBS shall
provide reasonable assistance, including reasonably requested documentation,
to Acquiror in the preparation of the Radio Closing Report. Acquiror shall
also deliver to CBS documentary materials and analyses used in the
preparation of the Radio Closing Report reasonably requested by CBS. The
amounts set forth in the Radio Closing Report shall be determined in
accordance with the Sample Adjustment Statement and in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied with the Radio Audited Financial Statements for the
twelve (12) months ended December 31, 2015, in each case, subject to the
adjustments set forth in the Sample Adjustment Statement; in the event of any
inconsistencies between the Sample Adjustment Statement and GAAP, the Sample
Adjustment Statement shall prevail.

(c) In the event that CBS does not agree that the Radio Closing Report
prepared by Acquiror accurately reflects all or any portion of the Radio
Working Capital or the Radio Indebtedness, or that the Radio Closing Report
was prepared in the manner required by this Agreement, CBS shall, within
seventy-five (75) days of the date on which Acquiror delivers the Radio
Closing Report to CBS, prepare and deliver to Acquiror a written notice of
dispute (the " _Dispute Notice_ "), which Dispute Notice shall set forth
the basis for the dispute. In the event that CBS does not deliver a Dispute
Notice to Acquiror within the time period required by the immediately
preceding sentence, then the Radio Closing Report prepared by Acquiror,
including the Radio Working Capital, the Radio Indebtedness and the Final Net
Adjustment Amount set forth therein, shall be deemed to be and shall become
final, binding and conclusive on all of the parties hereto.

 

(d) In the event that CBS timely delivers a Dispute Notice to Acquiror in
accordance with the terms hereof, Acquiror and CBS shall attempt to reconcile
their differences, and any resolution by them as to any such disputes shall be
final, binding and

 



28  conclusive on all of the parties hereto. If CBS and Acquiror are unable to
resolve any such dispute within twenty (20) Business Days of Acquirors
receipt of the Dispute Notice from CBS, Acquiror and CBS shall submit the
items remaining in dispute for resolution to a nationally recognized
accounting firm that is mutually agreed by Acquiror and CBS (the "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ "). If Acquiror and CBS cannot mutually agree
on the choice of the _Independent Accounting Firm_ , then Acquiror shall
deliver to CBS a list of three independent accounting firms of national
standing in the United States and CBS shall select one of such three
accounting firms to act as the _Independent Accounting Firm_. Promptly
following the submission of the items in dispute to the Independent Accounting
Firm, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days following such
submission, Acquiror and CBS shall submit to such Independent Accounting Firm
(and the other party) all documentary materials and analyses that Acquiror or
CBS, as the case may be, believes to be relevant to a resolution of the
dispute set forth in the Dispute Notice. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall consider only those items or amounts set forth in the Radio Closing
Report as to which CBS has disagreed in the Dispute Notice. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of all
such submissions by Acquiror and CBS, determine and deliver to Acquiror and
CBS a written report containing such Independent Accounting Firms
determination of all disputed matters submitted to it for resolution, and such
written report and the determinations contained therein shall be final,
binding and conclusive on all of the parties hereto. With respect to each
disputed item, such determination, if not in accordance with the position of
either Acquiror or CBS, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than
the lower, of the amounts advocated CBS in the Dispute Notice or Acquiror in
the Radio Closing Report. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting
Firm shall be paid by CBS, on the one hand, and by Acquiror, on the other
hand, based upon the actual amount not awarded to CBS or Acquiror,
respectively, in relation to the aggregate amount actually contested by CBS
and Acquiror.

 

(e) If the Final Net Adjustment Amount as finally determined in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ is a negative number, then within five (5)
Business Days following the final determination of the Final Net Adjustment
Amount, CBS shall pay to the Surviving Corporation via wire transfer in
immediately available funds (in accordance with the wire instructions
provided by the Surviving Corporation) an amount in cash equal to the absolute
value of such Final Net Adjustment Amount. If the Final Net Adjustment Amount
as finally determined in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ is a
positive number, then within five (5) Business Days following the final
determination of the Final Net Adjustment Amount, the Surviving Corporation
shall pay to CBS via wire transfer in immediately available funds (in
accordance with the wire instructions provided by CBS) an amount in cash equal
to such Final Net Adjustment Amount.

comment on any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
Acquiror Registration Statement (which comments shall be reasonably considered
by Acquiror) prior to filing the same with the SEC, and with a copy of all
such filings made with the SEC. Acquiror shall advise CBS and Radio promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Acquiror Registration
Statement have become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed,

Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC
for additional information.

 



81 (g) CBS and Radio shall provide Acquiror with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Radio Registration
Statement or the Schedule TO (which comments shall be reasonably considered by

Radio Common Stock issuable in connection with the Final Distribution for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Radio Registration Statement or the Schedule TO or comments
thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information.

(h) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance
should occur that results in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Acquiror
Registration Statement, the Radio Registration Statement or the Schedule TO
containing an untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, or that otherwise should be described in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Acquiror Registration
Statement, the Radio Registration Statement or the Schedule TO, promptly upon
obtaining Knowledge thereof, CBS, Radio and Acquiror shall promptly notify
each other of the occurrence of such event and, as appropriate, then promptly
prepare, file and clear with the SEC and mail, or cause to be mailed, to
Acquirors or CBSs shareholders (as applicable) each such amendment or
supplement.

 

(i) CBS and Radio agree to promptly provide Acquiror with the information
concerning CBS and Radio and their respective Affiliates required to be

their respective Subsidiaries businesses as Acquiror may reasonably request
in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Acquiror Registration Statement.

 

(j) Acquiror agrees to promptly provide CBS and Radio with the information
concerning Acquiror and its Affiliates required to be included in the Radio

request in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the
Radio Registration Statement and the Schedule TO.

(k) In connection with the filing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
Acquiror Registration Statement, the Radio Registration Statement or the
Schedule TO, each of CBS, Radio and Acquiror shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) cooperate with the other parties to prepare pro forma financial
statements that comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC to the
extent required for such filings, including the requirements of Regulation
S-X; and (ii) provide

 



82  and make reasonably available upon reasonable notice the senior management
employees of the other party to discuss the materials prepared and delivered

(l) To the extent required to be included in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or

the Radio Group. In the case of any such combined financial statements of the
Radio Group for any quarterly period, each of CBS and Radio shall use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that such financial statements shall be

reasonable best efforts to procure, at its expense, the delivery of the
consents of its independent auditors as may be required to be filed with the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Acquiror Registration Statements, as applicable.

 

Section 7.5 _Shareholders Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date on which the SEC shall clear
(whether orally or in writing) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and, if
required by the SEC as a condition to the mailing of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Acquiror Registration Statement shall have been
declared effective, Acquiror shall call a meeting of its shareholders (the "
_Acquiror Shareholders Meeting_ ") to be held as promptly as practicable for
the purpose of voting upon the Acquiror Shareholder Approvals. Acquiror shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Acquirors stockholders the

Shareholders Meeting at the time and in the manner provided by the applicable
provisions of the PBCL, the Exchange Act and the Acquiror Charter and Acquiror
Bylaws and shall conduct the Acquiror Shareholders Meeting and the
solicitation of proxies in connection therewith in compliance with such
statutes, the Acquiror Charter and Acquiror Bylaws.

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall include the Acquiror Recommendation and Acquiror
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Acquiror Shareholder
Approvals; _provided_ that if the Acquiror Board effects a Change in
Recommendation, Acquiror may cease to use such efforts; _provided_ , _further_
, that even if the Acquiror Board effects a Change in Recommendation, unless
this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _
9.1_, Acquiror shall nevertheless call the Acquiror Shareholders Meeting for
the purposes of voting on the Acquiror Shareholder Approvals and submit the
Acquiror Shareholder Approvals to the vote of the shareholders of Acquiror.

 



83 (c) Subject to _Article IX_ , Acquiror shall duly take all lawful action
to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Acquiror Shareholders Meeting
for the purpose of obtaining the Acquiror Shareholder Approvals. Unless a
Change in Recommendation has occurred, the Acquiror Board of Directors shall

Acquiror covenants that, unless a Change in Recommendation has occurred in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.11_, Acquiror will, through the Acquiror
Board, recommend to its shareholders approval of the Acquiror Shareholder
Approvals, and further covenants that the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will
include such recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 7.5(c)_ , if, on a date for which the Acquiror Shareholders Meeting
is scheduled, Acquiror has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of votes of Acquiror Common Stock to obtain the Acquiror Shareholder
Approvals, whether or not a quorum is present, Acquiror shall have the right
to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Acquiror
Shareholders Meeting; _provided_ that the Acquiror Shareholders Meeting is not
postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than thirty (30) days after the
date for which the Acquiror Shareholders Meeting was originally scheduled
(excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law).

 

(d) Acquiror agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, its obligations to hold the Acquiror
Shareholders Meeting pursuant to this _Section 7.5(d)_ shall not be affected
by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to
Acquiror of any Acquiror Acquisition Proposal or by any Change in
Recommendation.

Section 7.6 _Listing_. Acquiror shall make application to the NYSE for the
listing of the shares of Acquiror Class A Common Stock to be issued pursuant
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and use all reasonable best
efforts to cause such shares to be approved for listing on the NYSE, and CBS
and Radio shall reasonably cooperate with Acquiror with respect to such
listing.

Section 7.7 _Intercompany Accounts_. Except as contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Transaction Agreements, on or prior to the Closing Date, CBS
shall cause all intercompany accounts between any member of the CBS Group, on
the one hand, and any member of the Radio Group, on the other hand, to be
settled, at the option of CBS, or otherwise eliminated, in an equitable manner
between the parties as reasonably determined in good faith by CBS, including
as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.2_. Intercompany accounts between and
among the members of the Radio Group shall not be affected by this _Section_
__ _ 7.7_.

 

Section 7.8 _Termination of Intercompany Agreements_. Effective as of the
Closing, all Contracts (other than as provided in Section 3.4(d) of the
Separation Agreement), including all obligations to provide advertising,
content, goods, services or other benefits, between any member of the CBS
Group, on the one hand, and any members of the Radio Group, on the other hand,
shall be terminated in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.4(d) the
Separation Agreement.

 



84 Section 7.9 _Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in
doing or causing to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after the
date hereof, but in any event before the Termination Date, including (i)
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect
all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings and Tax ruling
requests and to obtain as promptly as practicable all Acquiror Approvals and
CBS Approvals and all other consents, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations and clearances
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any
Governmental Authority in order to consummate the Radio Reorganization, the
Final Distribution, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (collectively, and as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 7.9_ of
the CBS Disclosure Letter, the " _Approvals_ "), (ii) taking all reasonable
steps as may be necessary to obtain all Approvals (including Acquiror
providing a guarantee of Radios obligations as reasonably necessary to obtain
such Approvals and using reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation
on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid
entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that would prevent or delay the consummation of the
Closing) (iii) taking reasonable efforts to share information protected
from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine,
joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.9_ in a manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section_ __ _
7.9_, materials provided to the other Party or its outside counsel may be
redacted to (x) remove references concerning valuation or other confidential
information as determined by such providing Party in good faith, (y) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (z) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege concerns and (iv) taking all reasonable steps as
may be necessary to effect the Contribution at the Effective Time.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party hereto
agrees to make: (i) an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) Business
Days after the date hereof and (ii) all other necessary filings with other
Governmental Authorities, including the FCC, relating to the Radio
Reorganization, the Final Distribution, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and, in each case and in the case of any
investigation or inquiry by a Governmental Authority, to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to such applicable Laws or by such authorities and to use
reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and the receipt of the Approvals
under such other applicable Laws or from such authorities before the
Termination Date. Without limiting the foregoing, and subject to _Section
7.9(e)_ below, each of Acquiror and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and CBS and
Radio, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.9_ to obtain all Approvals, use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with
any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii)
promptly inform the other Parties of any communication received by such Party
from, or given by such Party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the

 



85  FCC or any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby (and in each
case, if any such communication is in writing, share a copy with the other
Party) and (iii) permit the other Party to review in advance any written
communication to be given by a Party to, and consult with each other (x) in
advance of any meeting or material telephone call with, and (y) in the
preparation of any written submission to, the DOJ, the FTC, the FCC or any
such other Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the
DOJ, the FTC, the FCC or such other applicable Governmental Authority or other
Person, give the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences. No Party shall take any action that would, or fail
to take any action the failure of which to take would, reasonably be expected
to have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the receipt of the
Approvals from Governmental Authorities.

(c) The Parties shall file, or cause to be filed, and not withdraw, as
promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than thirty (30) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement, the FCC Application and all other
necessary filings to obtain the FCC Consent (including FCC Form 315 or other
appropriate forms) that are required in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any assignment or transfer of
control of the Radio FCC Licenses or Acquiror FCC Licenses, as applicable. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the Parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain the FCC Consent as promptly as practicable. To that end,
each Party agrees to enter into and comply with, and cause the members of the
Radio Group and the Acquiror Group, as applicable, to enter into and
comply with, a tolling, assignment and assumption or similar agreement with
the FCC to provide for the extension of the statute of limitations for the FCC
to determine or impose a forfeiture penalty against a Radio Station, the
assumption of liabilities in connection with an assignment of license, or
such other matters as the FCC may require, in connection with (i) any pending
complaints that the Radio Station aired programming that contained obscene,
indecent or profane material or (ii) any other enforcement matters against
the Radio Station (a " _Tolling Agreement_ ") if so requested by the FCC. The
Parties shall consult in good faith with each other prior to entry into any
such Tolling Agreement. In addition, until such time as the FCC Consent shall
have become a Final Order, the Parties, as applicable, each shall oppose any
petitions to deny or other objections filed with respect to the FCC
Application to the extent such petition or objection relates to such Party.

(d) Without limiting the generality of Acquirors and Merger Subs undertaking
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.9_, each of Acquiror and Merger Sub
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts and to take any and all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment that may be asserted
by any Governmental Authority or any other Person so as to enable the Parties
hereto to obtain the Approvals and consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as soon as practicable after the date hereof, but in any event
before the Termination Date. In furtherance of the foregoing, Acquiror and
Merger Sub agree to propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent
decree, Order, agreements with Governmental Authorities or otherwise,
Commitments, Conduct Restrictions and/or the sale, hold separate, divestiture
or disposition of any of its assets, properties or businesses or of the
assets, properties or businesses to be transferred to the Acquiror Group
pursuant to this Agreement as are required in order to (i)
resolve expeditiously any objections any Governmental Authority may assert
with respect

 



86  to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to obtain any
Approval from any Governmental Authority and/or (ii) avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect
of materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that any such Commitments, Conduct
Restrictions, sales, hold separates, divestitures or dispositions by the Radio
Group shall be conditioned upon and become effective only from and after the
Closing. In addition, each of Acquiror and Merger Sub shall use
its reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
that would prevent or delay the consummation of the Closing.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the Parties agree and acknowledge that neither this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_ nor
the "reasonable best efforts" standard contained herein shall require, or be
construed to require, any Party to propose, negotiate, commit to, effect or
become subject to, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (i)
any Commitments or Conduct Restrictions on the Acquiror Group or the Radio
Group, or any requirements for the Acquiror Group or Radio Group to sell,
divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any of their assets, properties
or businesses (including the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired
pursuant to this Agreement or the Separation Agreement) (" _Divestitures_ "),
in each case with respect to this clause (i) that would, individually or in
the aggregate, be expected to account for a loss of more than $40,000,000
EBITDA for the twelve (12) months ended December 31, 2016 or (ii) any
Commitments or Conduct Restrictions on the CBS Group (other than reasonable
and customary transitional arrangements to facilitate Divestitures), or any
requirements for the CBS Group to sell, divest, hold separate or otherwise
dispose of any of its assets, properties or businesses (any such
requirements, together with the Commitments, Conduct Restrictions and
requirements contemplated by the preceding clause (i), a " _Burdensome
Restriction_ ").

 

(f) The Parties shall reasonably cooperate and consult with each other in good
faith to jointly coordinate communications with any Governmental Authority
and jointly develop strategy for responding to any investigation or other
inquiry by any Governmental Authority and formulating proposals to any
Governmental Authority related to the Approvals or any other matter
described in this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_. To the extent that, after reasonably
cooperating and consulting with each other, the Parties are unable to reach
agreement as to the strategy for responding to any investigation or other
inquiry by any Governmental Authority or for formulating proposals to any
Governmental Authority related to the Approvals or any other matter described
in this Section 7.9 (collectively, the " _Agreement Disputes_ "), any member
of the CBS Group or the Radio Group, on the one hand, or the Acquiror Group,
on the other hand, involved in an Agreement Dispute may deliver a notice (an "
_Escalation Notice_ ") demanding an in-person meeting between the Chief
Executive Officer of Acquiror and the Chief Operating Officer of CBS
(collectively, the " _Party Designees_ "). A copy of any such Escalation
Notice shall be given to the chief legal officer or general counsels of
CBS and of Acquiror (which copy shall state that it is an Escalation Notice
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_). Any agenda, location or procedures for
such discussions or negotiations between CBS and Acquiror may be established
by CBS, on the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other hand, from time to time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Party Designees shall use their reasonable
efforts to meet within five (5)

 



87  days of the delivery of Escalation Notice (or such shorter time as is
necessary to avoid immediate irreparable injury). If, on or before September
30, 2017, the Party Designees are not able to resolve the Agreement Dispute
within ten (10) days after the date of receipt of the Escalation Notice (or
such shorter time as is necessary to avoid immediate irreparable injury), then
the Chief Executive Officer of the Acquiror shall make a good faith,
reasonable determination as to the final determination with respect to such
Agreement Dispute, taking into account (x) the impact of the proposed
resolution of such Agreement Dispute on the value of the Acquiror Group
(including the Radio Group, following the Closing) and (y) the impact of the
proposed resolution of such Agreement Dispute on the ability of the Parties to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in as prompt a manner as practicable, with each such factor
weighted equally. Following September 30, 2017, Agreement Disputes shall be
resolved only with the joint agreement of the Parties. Subject to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.9_ and the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, Acquiror, Merger Sub, CBS and Radio shall coordinate and cooperate
fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing such
assistance as the other Parties may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing. To the extent practicable under the circumstances, none of the
Parties shall agree to participate in any substantive meeting or conference
with any Governmental Authority, or any member of the staff of any
Governmental Authority, in respect of any filing, proceeding, investigation
(including any settlement of the investigation), litigation, or other inquiry
related to the Transactions, unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, where permitted, allows the other party to participate. No Party
hereto shall be required to comply with any of the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 7.9(f)_ to the extent that such compliance would be prohibited
by applicable Law.

 

(g) To the extent that any Divestitures are required by any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Section 7.9, Acquiror and Merger Sub shall take the lead in
negotiating definitive transaction agreements with respect to such
Divestitures; provided, that Acquiror and Merger Sub shall (i) cooperate with
CBS and Radio in a commercially reasonable manner in developing and
implementing a strategy and process for negotiating and consummating such
Divestitures, including considering in good faith any comments from CBS and
Radio, and (ii) consult with CBS and Radio on a regular basis and in good
faith in carrying out the foregoing strategy and process; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any such Divestitures by the Radio Group shall be conditioned
upon and become effective only from and after the Closing.

(h) The Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the grant
of each application for renewal (each, a " _Renewal Application_ ") of any
Radio FCC License or Acquiror FCC License that is pending on the date hereof.
To that end, each Party agrees to enter into and comply with, and cause the
members of the Radio Group and Acquiror Group to enter into and comply with,
a Tolling Agreement if so requested by the FCC in order to obtain the grant of
a Renewal Application. The Parties shall consult in good faith with each other
prior to entry into any such Tolling Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, to avoid disruption or delay in the processing of the FCC
Application, the Parties agree, as part of the FCC Application, to request
that the FCC apply its policy permitting the assignment or transfer of
control of broadcast licenses in transactions involving multiple stations to
proceed, notwithstanding the pendency of one or more renewal applications, as
set forth in _Shareholders_ _of_ _CBS_ _Corporation_ , 16 FCC Rcd 16072
(2001). The Parties and their Affiliates shall make such representations and
agree to

 



88  such undertakings as are necessary or appropriate to invoke such policy,
including undertakings for the transferee of the Radio FCC Licenses and
Acquiror FCC Licenses to assume the position of the applicant before the FCC
with respect to a pending Renewal Application and to assume the corresponding
regulatory risks relating to any such Renewal Application.

 

(i) If the Effective Time shall not have occurred for any reason within the
original effective periods of the FCC Consent, and no Party shall have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, the Parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain one or more extensions of the
effective period of the FCC Consent to permit consummation of the
transactions hereunder. Upon receipt of the FCC Consent, the Parties shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect the FCC
Consent to permit consummation of the transactions hereunder. No extension of
the FCC Consent shall limit the right of any Party to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof.

Section 7.10 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, CBS and Radio shall (and shall cause the Radio
Subsidiaries to) afford to the Representatives of Acquiror and Merger Sub,
access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to all books, contracts, records and Representatives of the members of
the CBS Group and Radio Group, in each case to the extent related to the
Radio Business, and, during such period, Radio shall (and shall cause the
Radio Subsidiaries to) make available to the Representatives of Acquiror and
Merger Sub, upon Acquirors and Merger Subs reasonable request, (i) a copy
of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities laws, or the rules and regulations of self-regulatory
organizations (other than reports or documents that such Party is not
permitted to disclose under applicable Law) and (ii) all other information
concerning the Radio Business as Acquiror may reasonably request. No member of
the CBS Group or Radio Group shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
information or contravene any Law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or
decree or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement,
or would unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the businesses of
the CBS Group or the Radio Group. The Parties will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply. For the avoidance of doubt, CBS or Radio, as it
deems advisable and necessary, may designate any information described in
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.10_ (or elsewhere in this Agreement) as competitively
sensitive materials and as "outside counsel only" or "outside accounting firm
only" and such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to the recipients outside counsel or accounting firm, as the case may
be, and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel or accounting firm to
employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the
advance written consent of any member of the CBS Group or Radio Group
providing such materials.

(b) Upon reasonable notice, Acquiror shall (and shall cause the Acquiror
Subsidiaries to) afford to the Representatives of CBS and Radio, access,
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to
all books, contracts, records and Representatives of the members of the
Acquiror Group, and, during such period, Acquiror shall (and shall

 



89  cause the Acquiror Subsidiaries to) make available to the Representatives of
CBS and Radio, upon CBSs and Radios reasonable request, (i) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received
by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities laws, or the rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations
(other than reports or documents that such Party is not permitted to disclose
under applicable Law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as CBS may reasonably request. No member of the
Acquiror Group shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
information or contravene any Law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, or
would unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the businesses of
the Acquiror Group. The Parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. For the avoidance of doubt, Acquiror or Merger Sub, as it
deems advisable and necessary, may designate any information described in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.10_ (or elsewhere in this Agreement) as competitively
sensitive materials and as "outside counsel only" or "outside accounting firm
only" and such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to the recipients outside counsel or accounting firm, as the case may
be, and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel or accounting firm to
employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written
consent of any member of the Acquiror Group providing such materials.

(c) The Parties will hold any such information that is nonpublic
in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement
will remain in full force and effect.

 

(d) No such investigation as described in this _Section_ __ _ 7.10_ by either
CBS, Radio, Acquiror or Merger Sub shall affect the representations and
warranties of any Party hereto.

Section 7.11 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) _Acquiror Superior Proposal_. From and after the date of this Agreement,
Acquiror will, and will cause each Acquiror Subsidiary and each of the
directors, officers, employees and Representatives of the Acquiror Group to
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any Acquiror
Acquisition Proposal and will enforce and, except as otherwise prohibited by
applicable Law, will not waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or
standstill agreement (or any similar agreement) to which any member of the
Acquiror Group is a party relating to any such Acquiror Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , _that_ Acquiror shall be permitted to grant a waiver of any
standstill agreement, in response to a bona fide unsolicited request (and to
permit such request) for such waiver from the counterparty thereto, to permit
an Acquiror Acquisition Proposal to be made. Acquiror will promptly request
each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of any Acquiror Acquisition Proposal to
return or destroy all confidential information furnished prior to the
execution of this Agreement to or for the benefit of such Person by or on
behalf of any member of the Acquiror Group. Acquiror shall not, and shall

contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, in
the event that the Acquiror receives after the date of this Agreement and
prior to obtaining the Acquiror Shareholder Approvals, a _bona_ _fide_ written
Acquiror Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of
this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ and which the Acquiror Board determines (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) to be, or to be reasonably likely to lead
to, an Acquiror Superior Proposal, Acquiror may then take the following
actions:

 

(i) furnish any nonpublic information with respect to the members of the
Acquiror Group to the Person or group (and their respective Representatives)
making such Acquiror Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that prior to furnishing
any such information, it receives from such Person or group an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms that are at least as restrictive

Agreement (except that any such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit
the making of an Acquiror Acquisition Proposal) (an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ "); and

(ii) following any discussions regarding, and the execution of, an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, engage in further discussions or negotiations with
such Person or group (and their Representatives) with respect to such Acquiror
Acquisition Proposal.

after receipt) notify CBS of the receipt by Acquiror of any Acquiror
Acquisition Proposal and copies of any written materials evidencing such
Acquiror Acquisition Proposal (which notice and copies shall identify the
Person(s) making such Acquiror Acquisition Proposal). Acquiror will keep
CBS reasonably informed of the status and material terms and conditions of
any such Acquiror Acquisition Proposal. Without limitation of the foregoing,
Acquiror will promptly provide to CBS (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) any material modifications to the terms of any Acquiror
Acquisition Proposal (including promptly furnishing copies of any written
materials evidencing such material modifications) and will promptly notify CBS
of any determination by the Acquiror Board that an Acquiror Acquisition
Proposal constitutes an Acquiror Superior Proposal. In addition, Acquiror
shall, to the extent not already provided to CBS, provide CBS as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) with all
information provided pursuant to _Section 7.11(b)(i)_ and all other
information as is reasonably necessary to keep CBS reasonably currently
informed of all written or material oral communications regarding, and the
status of, any such Acquisition Proposal and any related discussions or
negotiations. Acquiror shall not, and shall cause any Acquiror Subsidiary not
to,

 



91  enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, and no member of the Acquiror Group is party to any Contract, in
each case, that prohibits Acquiror from complying with its obligations under
this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_.

(d) _Change of Recommendation; Termination_. Except as expressly permitted by
this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_, from and after the date hereof until the Effective

recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or allow Acquiror or
any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into any Acquiror Acquisition

Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and, the Acquiror Board has
determined in good faith that such Acquiror Superior Proposal continues to be
an Acquiror Superior Proposal or (B) an Intervening Event, such Intervening
Event is continuing and the Acquiror Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, the failure to make a
Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement, would constitute a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

(iii) Acquiror has (A) provided to CBS and Radio five (5) Business Days prior
written notice (the " _Acquiror Notice Period_ "), which shall state

provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the

and circumstances of such Intervening Event shall require a new notice,
_provided_ that the Acquiror Notice Period in connection with any such new
notice shall be three (3) Business Days) and (z) that the Acquiror Board

of doubt, if any disclosure or other action pursuant to clause (i) of this

be a Change in Recommendation for all purposes under this Agreement.

Financing from the same and/or alternative financing sources without the
consent of Acquiror (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) if such amendment, modification or waiver (i) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Radio Financing to an amount that, together with

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including repayment in full

by this Agreement or adds new or additional conditions precedent to obtaining

therewith.

(d) If any portion of the Radio Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Radio Commitment Letter and Related Letter

applicable, CBS and Radio shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange
and obtain as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event
alternative debt financing from alternative financing sources on terms not
materially less favorable to Radio and Acquiror in the aggregate than those
contained in the Radio Commitment Letter, in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that is
otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Acquiror (" _Alternative Debt
Financing_ ").

 

(e) CBS and/or Radio shall give Acquiror prompt notice of (i) (A) any material
breach or default, or (B) any written notice received by them of any

provided, to each Radio Employee, while employed by Acquiror or its
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time, (A) for the period commencing on the
Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), base compensation that is no less favorable to such
Radio Employee than the base compensation provided to such Radio Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (B) until December 31, 2017, (I)
a short-term incentive opportunity that is no less favorable than such Radio
Employees short-term incentive opportunity in effect immediately prior to the

plans and retiree medical plans) that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than those provided to such Radio Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time and with respect to severance benefits, as further described in 
_Section 7.20(a)(iii)_.

(ii) _Acquiror_ _Employees_. During the Continuation Period, Acquiror
shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the members
of the Acquiror Group who continues to be so employed as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (the " _Acquiror Employees_ "), while employed by
Acquiror or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time, base compensation that
is no less favorable to such Acquiror Employee than the base compensation
provided to such Acquiror Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(iii) _Severance_. Acquiror shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to
each Radio Employee whose employment is terminated by Acquiror or its
Subsidiaries during the Continuation Period under circumstances that would
have entitled such Radio Employee to severance benefits under the severance
plan or policy of Radio as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Radio Severance Plan_ "), severance benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance benefits that would have been payable under the
Radio Severance Plan, determined without regard to any discretion of

on full service credit for years of service with CBS and its Affiliates (and
predecessors) and without taking into account any reduction after the Closing
in compensation paid to such Radio Employee, subject to the delivery and
effectiveness of a release of claims from the Radio Employee in favor of the
Acquiror Group, Radio Group and the CBS Group.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
(A) Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume,
honor and fulfill all Radio Benefit Plans and Acquiror Benefit Plans, in each
case in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the date
hereof or as subsequently amended as permitted pursuant to the terms of such

Acquiror Employee (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") who is covered by a
Collective Bargaining Agreement or who is in a collective bargaining unit,
Acquiror shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, provide
compensation and employee benefits in accordance with the applicable
Collective Bargaining Agreement as in effect from time to time.

 



98 (b) _Service Credit_. For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and
level of benefits under any plans providing benefits to any Continuing
Employee after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Continuing
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Acquiror
Group and its Affiliates and predecessors, or the CBS Group or Radio Group
and their respective Affiliates and predecessors, before the Effective Time,
to the extent such service was recognized by the Acquiror Group or Radio
Group, as applicable, for similar purposes prior to the Effective Time (or,
in the case of Radio Employees, as set forth in the Separation Agreement);
_provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to (A) benefit
accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or (B) to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (x) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under an
Acquiror Benefit Plan or Radio Benefit Plan, as applicable, in which
such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time
(such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (y) for purposes of each
New Plan providing life insurance, medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits, Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause (1) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
covered dependents, unless and to the extent the individual,
immediately prior to entry in the New Plans, was subject to such conditions
under the comparable Old Plans, and (2) any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

 

(c) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer
upon any Continuing Employee any right to continue in the employ or service
of Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, which rights are
hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any
Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without
cause. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Agreement shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment
or other modification of any Radio Benefit Plan or Acquiror Benefit Plan, or
(ii) create any third-party rights in any current or former service provider
or employee of Acquiror, Radio or any of their respective Affiliates (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

any member of the Radio Group (each, a " _Director Indemnified Party_ ") as
provided in organizational documents of any member of the Radio Group, in each
case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other
contracts in effect on the date hereof, shall be assumed by Acquiror, without
further action, at the Closing and

 



99  shall survive the Radio Reorganization, the Final Distribution and the

under applicable Law, Radio shall, and Acquiror shall cause Radio to,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Director Indemnified Party against

arising in whole or in part out of actions or omissions in their capacity as
such occurring at or prior to the Closing (including in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements), and shall reimburse each Director Indemnified Party for any legal
or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Director Indemnified Party in
connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines as such expenses are
incurred.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Radio may obtain, at its election, prepaid "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance policies, which policies provide
Director Indemnified Parties with coverage for an aggregate period of at least
six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Closing, including in connection with the adoption
and approval of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The cost of obtaining such

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

Section 10.1 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts (any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than
one Party), each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together will constitute one and the same agreement. Signatures to this
Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail
in "portable document format" (".pdf") form, or by any other electronic means
intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a
document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper
document bearing the original signature. This Agreement, and any amendments
hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
other electronic transmission, will be treated in all manner and respects as
an original agreement and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
At the request of a Party, the other Parties will re-execute original
forms thereof and deliver them to the requesting Party. No Party will raise
the use of a facsimile machine or other electronic means to deliver a
signature or the fact that any signature was transmitted or communicated
through the use of facsimile machine or other electronic means as a defense
to the formation of a Contract and each such Party forever waives any such
defense.

 

Section 10.2 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Forum; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) Other than the provisions of this Agreement related to the Merger and that
are exclusively governed by the PBCL (including any claims for dissenters
rights), this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed and to be
performed wholly within such State and without reference to the choice-of-law
principles that would result in the application of the laws of a different
jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each
of the Parties hereto agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the
Radio Commitment Letter or the Related Letter, all claims or causes of action
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of
the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement, the Radio
Financing or the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby shall

 



109  be exclusively governed by, and constructed in accordance with, the internal
laws of the State of New York and without reference to the choice-of-law
principles that would result in the application of the laws of a different
jurisdiction.

 

(b) Each Party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any Delaware state
or federal court in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
and irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such Action may be heard
and determined in such Delaware state or federal court. Each Party irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, the defense of
an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action. The Parties further
agree, to the extent permitted by Law, that any final and nonappealable
judgment against any of them in any Action contemplated above shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside
the United States by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be
conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, each of the Parties to this
Agreement agrees that it will not bring or support any Person in any Action of
any kind or description against any of the Financing Sources in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Radio Commitment Letter, the Related Letter or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum
other than the federal and New York state courts located in the Borough of
Manhattan within the City of New York. Each Party irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent that it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such Action.

(c) EACH PARTY WAIVES (SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW) TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING
OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS
EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE ADMINISTRATION THEREOF OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN, INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE. NO PARTY SHALL SEEK A JURY TRIAL
IN ANY LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER LITIGATION PROCEDURE
BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED INSTRUMENTS OR
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES. NO PARTY WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY
SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN
WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES THAT
IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS
_SECTION 10.2_. NO PARTY HAS IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY
OTHER PARTY THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 10.2(c) WILL NOT BE FULLY
ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES.

(d) IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER, OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THE RADIO FINANCING, EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ANY CLAIM TO PUNITIVE,
EXEMPLARY OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF DAMAGES THAT ARE NOT
REASONABLY FORESEEABLE, IN 

 



110  EACH CASE FROM THE OTHER PARTY HERETO (OR ANY AFFILIATE OF SUCH OTHER PARTY
HERETO), INCLUDING ANY CLAIM AGAINST A FINANCING SOURCE.

 

Section 10.3 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any Person (other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns) any legal or equitable right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, and no
Person (other than as so specified) shall be deemed a third-party
beneficiary under or by reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Financing Source under the Radio Commitment Letter and the
Related Letter shall be an express third-party beneficiary of and shall be
entitled to rely upon  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, _Section_ __ _ 10.2_, this
_Section 10.3(a), Section_ __ _ 10.7_, _Section_ __ _ 10.11_ and _Section_
__ _ 10.15_ hereof, and each such Financing Source and its successors and
assigns may enforce such provisions.

(b) This Agreement (together with the other Transaction Agreements, the
Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits and the Disclosure Letters and the
other documents delivered pursuant hereto) constitutes the entire agreement of
all the Parties hereto and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. All exhibits attached
to this Agreement and the Disclosure Letters are expressly made a part
of, and incorporated by reference into, this Agreement. If an exhibit is a
form of agreement, such agreement, when executed and delivered by the parties
thereto, shall constitute a document independent of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
including as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 7.12_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.3_,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the Party incurring such expenses, except (i) filing fees, printing and
mailing expenses incurred in connection with Radio Registration Statement, the
Acquiror Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (ii)
filing fees paid to Governmental Authorities with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to the HSR Act and the FCC Consent, each of which
shall be shared equally by Acquiror and Radio and (iii) if the Merger is not
consummated, all Financing Costs shall be shared equally by Acquiror and
Radio; _provided_ , that, (a) in the event this Agreement is terminated by CBS
or Acquiror pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ or _Section 9.1(j)_ , by CBS pursuant
to _Section 9.1(f)_ or  _Section 9.1(g)_ or by Acquiror pursuant to _Section
9.1(e)_, Acquiror shall reimburse Radio for any Financing Costs incurred
(provided that any amounts paid by Acquiror pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
10.4_ shall reduce the amount of the Termination Fee to be paid by Acquiror,
if applicable) and (b) in the event this Agreement is terminated by Acquiror
pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_ , Radio shall not be reimbursed by Acquiror for
any Financing Costs incurred if the Merger is not consummated.

 



111 Section 10.5 _Notices_. All notices and other communications to be given to
any Party hereunder shall be sufficiently given for all purposes hereunder if

Section 10.6 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns; _provided_ that no Party will assign its rights or delegate
any or all of its obligations under this Agreement without the express

violation of this _Section_ __ _ 10.6_ shall be void.

 



112 Section 10.7 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified or
amended, except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the
Party against whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is
sought. Any Party may, only by an instrument in writing, waive compliance by
the other Parties with any term or provision of this Agreement on the part of
such other Parties to be performed or complied with. The waiver by any Party
of a breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be construed
as a waiver of any subsequent breach. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, _Section_ __ _ 10.2_,
_Section 10.3(a)_, this _Section_ __ _ 10.7_,  _Section_ __ _ 10.11_ and
_Section_ __ _ 10.15_ (and any other provision of this Agreement to the
extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification of such
provision would modify the substance of such Sections) may not be amended,
supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in any manner that is materially
adverse in any respect to the Financing Sources without the prior written
consent of the Financing Sources

 

Section 10.8 _Interpretation_.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an article or section, such
reference shall be to an article or section of this Agreement, unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents to this Agreement is for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. The descriptive headings herein are inserted for convenience
of reference only and are not intended to be a substantive part of or to
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words
"hereof," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when
used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this
Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant thereto, unless otherwise defined
therein. The definitions and references contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and
references and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders
of such terms and references. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or
referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or
instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession
of comparable successor statutes, including all attachments thereto and
instruments incorporated therein. References to a Person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns. References to a date or time shall be deemed
to be such date or time in New York City, unless otherwise specified.
References to dollar amounts are to U.S. dollars, unless otherwise specified.
Each of the Parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this
Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the Parties and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party
by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, "consistent with past practice" when used with respect to
the members of the Radio Group means the past practice of any members of the
Radio Group and the CBS Group with respect the operations of the Radio Group.
Except as otherwise expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement or any
other Transaction Agreement, any provision herein that contemplates the
agreement, approval or consent of, or exercise of any right of, a Party, such
Party may give or withhold such agreement, approval or consent, or exercise
such right, in its sole and absolute discretion.

 

(b) Any matter disclosed in any particular section or subsection of the CBS
Disclosure Letter or the Acquiror Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to have
been disclosed in any other section or subsection of this Agreement, with
respect to which such matter is relevant so long as the applicability of such
matter to such section or subsection is reasonably apparent on the face of
the disclosure.

 



113 Section 10.9 _Severability_. If any provision (or part thereof) of this
Agreement, or the application of any provision (or part thereof) to any
Person or circumstance, shall be declared judicially to be invalid,
unenforceable or void, such decision shall not have the effect of invalidating
or voiding the remainder of this Agreement, it being the intent and agreement
of the Parties that this Agreement shall be deemed amended by modifying such
provision (or part thereof) to the extent necessary to render it valid, legal
and enforceable while preserving its intent or, if such modification is not
possible, by substituting therefor another provision that is legal and
enforceable and that achieves the same objective.

 

Section 10.10 _Limited Liability_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no stockholder, director, officer, Affiliate, agent or
representative of any of the Parties, in its capacity as such, shall have any
liability in respect of or relating to the covenants, obligations,
representations or warranties of such Party under this Agreement or in respect
of any certificate delivered with respect hereto or thereto and, to the
fullest extent legally permissible, each of the Parties, for itself and its
stockholders, directors, officers and Affiliates, waives and agrees not to
seek to assert or enforce any such liability that any such Person otherwise
might have pursuant to applicable Law.

Section 10.11 _Jurisdiction; Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties
irrevocably agrees that any claim, dispute or controversy (of any and every
kind or type, whether based on contract, tort, statute, regulation or
otherwise, and whether based on state, federal, foreign or any other Law),
arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement, or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and including disputes relating to the
existence, validity, breach or termination of this Agreement (any such claim
being a " _Covered Claim_ "), may be brought and determined in any federal or
state court located in the State of Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably submits in respect of Covered Claims for itself and in respect to
its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the aforesaid courts and agrees that it may be served with such legal process
at the address and in the manner set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.5_. Each of
the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action or proceeding
in respect of Covered Claims (i) any claim that it is not personally subject
to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the
failure to lawfully serve process, (ii) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, that
(A) the suit, Action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, Action or proceeding is
improper and (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

 



114 Section 10.12 _Specific Performance_. In the event of any actual or threatened
default in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, the Party who is thereby
aggrieved will have the right to specific performance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or such Transaction Agreement and injunctive
or other equitable relief in respect of its rights under this Agreement or
such Transaction Agreement, in addition to any and all other rights and
remedies at law or in equity. The Parties agree that the remedies at law for
any breach or threatened breach, including monetary damages, are inadequate
compensation for any loss and that any defense in any Action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate is waived. Any
requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are
waived by each of the Parties to this Agreement.

Section 10.13  _Additional Obligations_. Acquiror agrees that the members of
the Acquiror Group and the Acquiror Board will not submit any transaction or
agreement constituting an Acquiror Acquisition Proposal or Acquiror
Acquisition Agreement to the shareholders of Acquiror for approval at a
shareholder meeting convened prior to the twelve-month anniversary of the
termination of this Agreement, unless this Agreement is terminated (a)
pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ or (b) by CBS or Acquiror (as applicable) (i)
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ , unless (A) Acquirors failure to perform or
observe in any material respect any covenant, obligation or other agreement
contained in this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or has resulted
in, the failure of conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1(b)_ or _Section
8.1(c)_ to be satisfied or (B) an Acquiror Acquisition Proposal has been
publicly announced or otherwise made publicly known and not withdrawn prior
to such termination, (ii) pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_ , (iii) pursuant to
_Section 9.1(h)_ , unless Acquirors failure to comply with _Section_ __ _
7.9_ is the primary cause of the action or inaction permitting termination
pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_ , or (iv) pursuant to Section 9.1(i), unless
Acquirors failure to comply with _Section_ __ _ 7.9_ is the primary cause of
the action or inaction permitting termination pursuant to _Section 9.1(i)_.
For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 10.13_ shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.14 _Survival of Covenants_. Except as expressly set forth herein,
the covenants contained in this Agreement, and liability for the breach of
any obligations contained herein, will survive in accordance with their terms.

Section 10.15 _No Liability of Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, no member of the Acquiror Group or any of
its Affiliates shall have any rights or claims against any Financing Source in
connection with this Agreement, the Radio Financing or the Transactions;
_provided_ that the foregoing will not limit the rights of Radio or any other
party to the Radio Financing under the Radio Commitment Letter, the Related
Letter or the Definitive Debt Documents.

(i) each of the Distributions will qualify as a tax-free transaction under
Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), and (ii) the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code; (b) it is a condition to the Merger that, prior
to the Effective Time, the Radio Reorganization and Final Distribution be
completed in accordance with this Agreement; and (c) the Final Distribution
will be carried out for the corporate business purpose of tailoring Radios
corporate structure to facilitate the Merger; and

WHEREAS, the Parties intend in this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the

set forth the principal arrangements between them regarding the Merger, the
Radio Reorganization and the Final Distribution.

(but subject to its obligations under Sections 7.3, 7.4 and 7.9(a) of the

(b) To the extent there is any Clean-Up Spin-Off, each Record Holder will be
entitled to receive for each share of CBS Common Stock held by such Record
Holder after consummation of the Exchange Offer a number of shares of Radio
Common Stock equal to the total number of Unsubscribed Shares, _multiplied_
by a fraction, the numerator of which is total number of shares of CBS Common
Stock held by such Record Holder after consummation of the Exchange Offer and
the denominator of which is the total number of shares of CBS Common Stock
outstanding on the Distribution Date; _provided_ that for the purposes of
calculating such fraction pursuant to any Clean-Up Spin-Off, CBS Class A
Common Stock and CBS Class B Common Stock shall be considered as a single
class.

Date or (v) are conditions set forth in Section 8.1(a) of the Merger
Agreement.

(b) If CBS waives the condition set forth in Section 3.3(a)(ii), then unless
such condition cannot be met solely as a result of one or more events, facts
or circumstances that are not within the control of CBS, CBS shall pay to
Acquiror the Tax Opinion Waiver Penalty (without duplication of any amount
paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b)) no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day

Misplaced Asset or Liability and its relationship to the Radio Business or CBS
Business, as applicable.

access as provided in clauses (iii) and (iv) hereof as promptly as possible
such that the other Party will be able to meet its financial reporting
requirements.

 

(vi) In the event that either Radio or (to the extent related to Radio) CBS or

Acquiror contemplates a material change in accounting principle, policy or
estimate, or the Acquiror receives a claim or request for information from a
regulatory agency (including, but not limited to, a tax authority, the SEC,
Federal Communications Commission, or other governmental authority) or if the
Acquiror is subject to a legal claim or dispute relating to the Radio Group,
the Acquiror shall notify CBS immediately and give CBS a reasonable
opportunity to be involved in responding to such claim, inquiry, dispute or
request.

 

(b) Except as provided in any Ancillary Agreement, each Party, on behalf of
its respective Group, will provide, or cause to be provided, to the other
Partys Group, at any time after the Distribution Date and until the later of
(x) the sixth anniversary of the Distribution Date and (y) the expiration of
the relevant statute of limitations period, if applicable, and subject to the
terms of the Transaction Agreements, upon the prior written reasonable request
(i) by CBS or Radio for Shared Information or (ii) by (A) Radio for Retained

_further_ , that in the event that any Shared Information constitutes
privileged information, the Parties (including Acquiror after the
Distribution Date) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide access
to such information in a manner that would not reasonably be expected

 



\- 24 -  to violate any such privilege. Each of CBS and Radio agree to make their
respective personnel available during regular business hours to discuss the
Information exchanged pursuant to this  _Section 5.1(b)_.

(c) Other than in contribution or indemnification of a claim by a third party
or Governmental Authority, neither Party will be liable for any Losses
incurred by the other Party in the event that any Information exchanged or
provided pursuant to this Agreement that is an estimate or forecast, or that
is based on an estimate or forecast, is found to be inaccurate in the absence
of willful misconduct by the providing Person.

(d) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ shall require any Party to violate
any agreement with any third party regarding the confidentiality of
confidential and proprietary information relating to that third party or its
business; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that a Party would be
required under this _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ to disclose any such information,
such Party shall advise the other Party of such limitation or obligation and
use commercially reasonable efforts to seek to obtain such third partys
written consent to the disclosure of such information and to otherwise
disclose any such information in a manner that would not reasonably be
expected to violate such agreement.

after the Distribution Date) understand and appreciate that their mutual
interests will be best served by effecting a rapid and fair resolution of any
claims or disputes which may arise out of this _Section_ __ _ 5.1_.
Therefore, each Party agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve all such disputes as rapidly as possible on a fair and equitable
basis. Toward this end, each Party agrees to develop and follow a process for
presenting, rapidly assessing, and settling claims and other disputes on a
fair and equitable basis. If any dispute or claim arising under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.1_ cannot be readily resolved by the Parties, the Parties
agree to refer the matter to the chief financial officers of each Party (or
their designees) who shall meet and attempt to resolve the dispute within
fifteen (15) days from the date the dispute was brought before their
attention. If any dispute or claim arising under this _Section_ __ _ 5.1_
cannot be resolved by such chief financial officers (or their designees), the
Parties agree to refer the matter to a senior auditing partner of a nationally
recognized accounting firm not currently providing services to either Party.

regarding anticipated, threatened, pending, or completed litigation, claims,
government or regulatory inquiries, proceedings, or investigations, or
internal investigations reflect joint defense and common interest
communications, and thus are confidential and protected by the attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege, and any
other applicable privileges. The Final Distribution and Merger are not
intended to compromise the confidential and privileged nature of
those communications or any future privileged and confidential communications
they might have regarding litigation, claims, inquiries, proceedings, or
investigations.

 

(c) The Parties agree to reasonably cooperate with each other in good faith
in, and provide each other with prompt notice of, any
anticipated, threatened, or pending litigation, claims, government or
regulatory inquiries, proceedings, or investigations, or internal

may be named as a defendant in such Future CBS Litigation Matter;  _provided_

and/or Acquiror with respect to the Radio Reorganization, Final Distribution
or Merger (the matters in clauses (A) through (C) being " _Future Joint

(ii) CBS shall not modify or cancel the CBS Insurance Policies with respect
to events, acts, occurrences, happenings, losses, liabilities, damages,

benefits of the CBS Insurance Policies as set forth in this _Section_ __ _
5.3_ (including, but without limitation, commuting, buying-out, or releasing

(b) Radio agrees, for itself and each other member of the Acquiror Group and
Radio Group, that no member of the CBS Group nor any of their directors,
officers or employees shall have any liability to any member of the Acquiror
Group or Radio Group whatsoever as a result of the CBS Insurance Policies and
insurance practices of the CBS Group as in effect at any time prior to
the Distribution Date, including, without limitation, as a result of the
level or scope of any such insurance, the creditworthiness of any insurance
carrier, the terms and conditions of

 



\- 30 -  any CBS Insurance Policy, the adequacy or timeliness of any notice to any
insurance carrier with respect to any claim or potential claim or otherwise;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this  _Section 5.3(b)_ shall (i) not limit the
rights of Radio and Affiliates to access the CBS Insurance Policies, and (ii)
be subject to the obligations of CBS as otherwise set forth in Section 5.3.

 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in any Ancillary
Agreement, each of the Parties intends by this Agreement, to the fullest
extent permitted under the terms of the CBS Insurance Policies in accordance
with the applicable Law that, with respect to any Radio liability or Radio
Loss, each member of the Radio Group retain all of its Insurance Rights,
receive the full benefit of any transfer or assignment of Insurance Rights
permitted under the terms of the CBS Insurance Policies in accordance with the
applicable Law, and be a successor-in-interest to all rights that any member
of the Radio Group may have as of the Distribution Date, so as to avail itself
of any such CBS Insurance Policy, to obtain the Insurance Proceeds and
benefits thereof and to maximize the Insurance Proceeds and benefits
recoverable under the CBS Insurance Policies. CBS shall, at the reasonable
request of Radio, take all steps reasonably necessary or
desirable, including, without limitation, the execution and delivery of any
instruments, to cooperate with and to assist Radio in its pursuit of any
claims properly being asserted by or on behalf of Radio or its Affiliates
under the CBS Insurance Policies in accordance with the foregoing; _provided_
, _however_ , that CBS shall not be required to incur any out-of-pocket costs,
waive any rights or incur any liabilities in connection therewith, except to
the extent that such costs are advanced or reimbursed, or such liabilities are
assumed, by Radio or Acquiror.

 

(d) Except as otherwise contemplated in this Agreement or in any Ancillary
Agreement, after the Distribution Date, each member of the CBS Group, Radio
Group and Acquiror Group will share such Information as is reasonably
necessary in order to permit the other to manage and conduct its insurance
matters in an orderly fashion and pursue claims for insurance coverage under
the CBS Insurance Policies in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, sharing Information relating to impairment,
exhaustion, potential exhaustion, and potential impairment of limits of
liability of the CBS Insurance Policies and relating to maximums, caps, stop-
loss or other limits applicable to Insurance Charges. Each member of the CBS
Group, on the one hand, and the Radio Group and Acquiror Group, on the other
hand, at the request of the other, shall cooperate with and make commercially
reasonable efforts to assist the other in recoveries for claims under any CBS
Insurance Policy for the benefit of any insured party, including, without
limitation, consulting and sharing Information with the other with respect to
positions regarding insurance coverage, such as, by way of example, positions
relating to the number of "occurrences" or "accidents" and the proper trigger
of coverage, that may affect the others insurance rights or recoveries under
the CBS Insurance Policies.

(e) Subject to _Sections 5.3(d)_ , _5.3(f)_ , _5.3(g)_ and  _5.3(_ _i_ _)_ ,
with respect to liabilities of Radio (exclusive of any insured liabilities of
CBS), Radio Losses (exclusive of any insured CBS Losses), insured liabilities
of Radio, and insured Radio Losses, the members of the Radio Group shall have
the right, responsibility and authority for claims administration and
financial administration of claims that relate to or affect Radio under the
CBS Insurance Policies and for presentation and pursuit of claims for
insurance coverage under the CBS Insurance Policies. Except as otherwise
provided for in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, the members of
the Radio Group (including the Acquiror Group) shall assume responsibility
for, and 

 



\- 31 -  shall pay to the appropriate insurance carriers or otherwise, any premiums,
retrospectively rated premiums, defense costs, indemnity payments,
deductibles, retentions, amounts payable by a CBS captive insurer (except for
amounts actually reimbursed by a reinsurer of the captive), or other charges
under the CBS Insurance Policies (collectively, " _Insurance Charges_ ")
whenever arising, that shall become due and payable under the terms and
conditions of any applicable CBS Insurance Policy in respect of any
liabilities, losses, claims, actions or occurrences, whenever arising or
becoming known, to the extent such Insurance Charges involve or relate to any
of the assets, businesses, operations or liabilities of the Radio Business,
whether the same relate to the period prior to, on or after the Distribution
Date, but only to the extent such Insurance Charges arise from, and are
attributable to, claims asserted by or on behalf of Radio under the CBS
Insurance Policies. To the extent that the terms of any applicable CBS
Insurance Policy provide that any member of the CBS Group shall have an
obligation to pay or guarantee the payment of any Insurance Charges relating
to any member of the Radio Group, CBS shall be entitled to demand that the
members of the Radio Group or the Acquiror Group make such payment directly to
the Person entitled thereto or shall, upon demand by Radio, make such payment
with funds advanced to it by the members of the Radio Group or the Acquiror
Group. In connection with any such demand, CBS shall submit to Radio a copy of
any invoice received by CBS pertaining to such Insurance Charges, together
with appropriate supporting documentation, to the extent available. In the
event that the Radio Group or Acquiror Group fails to pay any such Insurance
Charges when due and payable, whether at the request of the Person entitled to
payment or upon demand by CBS, CBS may (but shall not be required to) pay
such Insurance Charges for and on behalf of Radio and, thereafter, Radio or
Acquiror shall forthwith reimburse CBS for such payment. Subject to the other
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the responsibility for claims
administration and financial administration of such CBS Insurance Policies in
this _Section 5.3(e)_ is in no way intended to limit, inhibit or preclude any
right of CBS, Radio or any other insured to insurance coverage for any
insured claims under the CBS Insurance Policies.

(f) With respect to any joint liability or any actual or alleged joint
liability or Loss of CBS and Radio, the right, responsibility and authority
for claims administration and financial administration of claims that relate
to or affect the CBS Insurance Policies and for the pursuit and prosecution
of claims for insurance coverage under the CBS Insurance Policies shall be
held jointly between the members of the CBS Group and the members of the Radio
Group. The members of the CBS Group, on the one hand, and the members of the
Radio Group and Acquiror Group, on the other hand, shall consult, cooperate
and coordinate with each other, including, without limitation, granting
consents to the other, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, with respect to such joint claims administration,
financial administration of claims, and pursuit and prosecution of claims for
insurance coverage under the CBS Insurance Policies. No member of the Radio
Group or Acquiror Group shall commence any litigation, arbitration, mediation
or similar proceeding (other than in accordance with _Article VII_ )
concerning coverage under the CBS Insurance Policies for such joint
liabilities or joint Losses without the consent of CBS, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. No member of the CBS Group shall commence any
litigation, arbitration, mediation or similar proceeding (other than in
accordance with _Article VII_ ) concerning coverage under the CBS
Insurance Policies for such joint liabilities or joint Losses without the
consent of Radio, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any
insurance recoveries for such joint liability or such joint Loss shall be
allocated between the members of the CBS Group and the Radio Group in
accordance with the portion of insurance recoveries that is attributable to
the portion of such joint liability or such joint Loss that is a liability of
CBS or a CBS Loss and the portion of such joint liability or such joint Loss
that is a liability of Radio or Radio Loss, respectively.

 



\- 32 - (g) Claims for coverage of insured liabilities of Radio or insured Losses of
Radio shall be tendered by CBS as necessary to invoke the benefit of the CBS
Insurance Policies, at Radios sole option, cost and expense. If the insurers
to whom such claims are tendered do not promptly acknowledge insurance
coverage in connection with the insured liabilities of Radio or insured
Losses of Radio, then, with respect to such insured liabilities of Radio or
insured Losses of Radio, Radio or one of the Radio Subsidiaries on an as-
incurred basis (i) shall advance all amounts expended by the CBS Group for or
with respect to such insured liabilities of Radio or insured Losses of Radio,
including, without limitation, all costs and expenses in connection with the
defense and settlement and in satisfaction of any judgment incurred, and
amounts sufficient to cover any Losses required to be paid by CBS or its
Subsidiaries and (ii) shall pay all costs incurred in connection with pursuing
and recovering Insurance Proceeds with respect to the insured liabilities of
Radio or insured Losses of Radio. Any payments made by any member of the Radio
Group on account of such insured liabilities of Radio or insured Losses of
Radio shall be deemed to be advances pursuant to this _Section 5.3(g)_. The
members of the Radio Group shall have the right to recover any advances made
pursuant to this _Section 5.3(g)_ from any member of the CBS Group, and each
member of the CBS Group shall have the obligation promptly to reimburse the
members of the Radio Group for such advances, solely from the Insurance
Proceeds of the CBS Insurance Policies that cover such insured liabilities of
Radio or insured Losses of Radio and that are received by the members of the
CBS Group. The members of the CBS Group (i) shall, at all times until paid to
a member of the Radio Group, hold Insurance Proceeds received for or with
respect to insured liabilities of Radio or insured Losses of Radio in trust
for the benefit of Radio; and (ii) shall promptly remit such Insurance
Proceeds to Radio.

(h) This Agreement is not intended as an assignment or attempted assignment
of any policy of insurance or as a contract of insurance and shall not be
construed to waive any right or remedy of any member of the CBS Group or the
Radio Group in respect of any insurance policy or any other contract or policy
of insurance except to the extent such assignment is permitted by the terms
of such policy in accordance with the applicable Law and CBS and Radio have
agreed to such assignment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) this Agreement
is intended as an assignment of Insurance Rights to members of the Radio
Group and each of their insured persons, and their respective successors-in-
interest and respective permitted assignees, to the extent allowed by
applicable law and as necessary to fully establish their rights to obtain
coverage under the CBS Insurance Policies as contemplated in this Section 5.3,
and (ii) CBS further shall use its best efforts to document and otherwise
establish the enforceability of such assignment of rights if necessary or
pursuant to the request of Radio or any member of the Radio Group. Nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed (i) an assignment or transfer of any rights of
any member of the CBS Group under the CBS Insurance Policies, or (ii) to
confer any insurance-related rights other than those provided under the terms
of any applicable CBS Insurance Policy on any party other than the members of
the CBS Group and Radio Group, each of their insured persons and their
respective successors-in-interest and respective permitted assignees in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 9.8_, including, without limitation, any
right to enforce for any other partys own benefit the arrangements made by
CBS and Radio in subparagraph (i) hereof.

 



\- 33 - (i) For purposes of the exhaustion of any limits that apply to coverage
available under the CBS Insurance Policies and for purposes of exhaustion of
any caps, stop-losses, limits or maximums that apply to any Insurance Charges,
amounts shall be allocated to the CBS Insurance Policies on a first come/first
served basis. That means that amounts covered by such CBS Insurance Policies
(including, without limitation, amounts paid as defense costs, settlements or
judgments) shall be allocated to such CBS Insurance Policies in the order in
which valid claims for payment of such amounts by any member of the CBS Group
or Radio Group are paid by insurers under the CBS Insurance Policies. With
respect to the application of the first come/first served principles, the
members of the CBS Group and Radio Group shall act in good faith and
avoid taking any actions for the purpose or with the intention of
accelerating or delaying their payment of such amounts or their submission of
claims under the CBS Insurance Policies in order to obtain some advantage with
respect to the exhaustion of applicable limits or with respect to the
application of the Insurance Charges under the CBS Insurance Policies;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that both CBS and Radio or any of
their respective Subsidiaries make claims under any CBS Insurance Policy
which may or do individually or together exceed the amount of any applicable
CBS Insurance Policy limit or sublimit, or any cap, stop-loss, limit or
maximum that may apply to any Insurance Charges, under such CBS
Insurance Policies, a fair and reasonable allocation of such policy limit or
sublimit, or any such cap, stop-loss, limit or maximum that may apply to any
Insurance Charges, shall be made between CBS and Radio (the " _Allocation_ ").
CBS and Acquiror shall negotiate the Allocation in good faith for a period
not to exceed 30 days. If CBS and Acquiror fail to agree upon the Allocation
within such 30-day period, then each of CBS and Acquiror shall be free to
deliver an Escalation Notice pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ and otherwise follow
the dispute resolution provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.2_.

 

(j) This Agreement is not intended to, nor shall it be deemed, to reduce,
negate, or supplant the obligations of any insurer pursuant to the CBS
Insurance Policies. Each of the Parties intends by this Agreement that a
third-party Person, including a third-party insurer or reinsurer, or other
third-party Person that, in the absence of the Agreement would otherwise be
obligated to pay any claim or satisfy any indemnity or other obligation,
shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto and shall not
be entitled to a "windfall" (i.e., avoidance of the obligation that such
Person would have in the absence of this Agreement). To the extent that any
such Person would receive such a windfall, CBS and Radio shall negotiate in
good faith concerning an amendment of this Agreement to avoid such a windfall.

 

Section 5.4 _Common Agreements_.

 

(a) Except as contemplated by any Ancillary Agreement or as otherwise agreed
in writing between Radio, CBS and Acquiror, from and after the date hereof
and prior to the Distribution Date, with respect to each Common Agreement, the
Parties (including Acquiror) shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate to
assign, at or prior to the Distribution Date, in relevant part to
the applicable member(s) of the applicable Group, or appropriately amend or
novate prior to or at the Distribution Date, each Common Agreement, so that
each Party or the member of its Group shall be entitled to the rights and
benefits, and shall assume the related portion of any Liabilities, inuring to
its respective businesses to the same extent received and borne as of
immediately prior to the date of such assignment, amendment or novation, with
respect to such Common Agreement; _provided_  that if the counterparty to any
Common Agreement that is entitled under the terms of such Common Agreement to
consent to the

 



\- 34 -  assignment, amendment or novation of such Common Agreement has not provided
such consent, or if such assignment or amendment would impair the benefit the
parties thereto derive from such Common Agreement, the provisions of _Section
5.4(c)_ shall apply to such Contract. For the avoidance of doubt, CBS shall
only be required to seek or obtain any consent with respect to a Common
Agreement (i) that is either (A) specified on  _Schedule 5.4(a)_ hereto or
(B) otherwise requested by Radio or Acquiror after the date hereof and the
failure to obtain such consent would result in the loss of a material monetary
benefit by Radio or would otherwise materially adversely effect the Radio
Business following the Final Distribution, and (ii) if and only if receipt of
such Consent is necessary for the Radio Group to have all material rights and
benefits under such Common Agreement; _provided_ _further_ , that if and when
any consent with respect to a Common Agreement is obtained in accordance with
this _Section 5.4(a)_ , such Common Agreement will be assigned, novated or
amended in accordance with this _Section 5.4(a)_. For the avoidance of doubt,
in no event shall any Common Agreement be assigned, novated or amended
pursuant to this _Section 5.4(a)_ in a manner that materially impairs the
benefit or increases the Liability to be received by any member of the Radio
Group relative to such benefit or Liability prior to the date of such
assignment, novation or amendment, without the prior written consent of
Acquiror.

 

(b) To the extent any Common Agreement has not been assigned, novated or
amended in accordance with _Section 5.4(a)_ prior to the Distribution Date:

(i) in connection with each Common Agreement primarily related to the Radio
Business], Radio agrees to indemnify and hold harmless CBS and any of its
Affiliates from and against any and all Liabilities arising out of third-party
claims or demands (including claims or demands by any party to any such Common
Agreement, other than CBS, Radio or any of their respective Affiliates) (x)
CBS or its Affiliates incur in connection with any breach of any obligation of
Radio, Acquiror or any of their Affiliates under or with respect to the Common
Agreements or (y) to the extent such claim or demand seeks payment or
performance by CBS or one of its Affiliates of any liability or obligation of
or requirement applicable to Radio or any of its Affiliates under or with
respect to the Common Agreements; _provided_ that Radio and its Affiliates
will have no liability or obligation to CBS and its Affiliates for failure to
purchase goods or services under the Common Agreements after the Distribution
Date, except where Radio or one of its Affiliates has, in anticipation of
the Final Distribution and with the written consent of Acquiror, entered into
a written agreement with the applicable third party to extend Radios or such
Affiliates participation under the Common Agreement past the Distribution
Date; and 

(ii) in connection with each Common Agreement primarily related to the CBS
Business, CBS agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Radio and any of its
Affiliates from and against any and all liabilities arising out of third-party
claims or demands (including any claims or demands by any party to any such
Common Agreement, other than CBS, Radio or any of their respective
Affiliates) Radio or its Affiliates incur in connection with any breach of any
obligation of CBS or any of its Affiliates under or with respect to the Common
Agreements; _provided_ that CBS and its Affiliates will have no liability or
obligation to Radio and its Affiliates for failure to purchase goods or
services under the Common Agreements after the Distribution Date, except where
CBS or one of its Affiliates has, in anticipation of the Final Distribution
and 

 



\- 35 -  with the written consent of Acquiror, entered into a written agreement with
the applicable third party to extend CBSs or such Affiliates participation
under the Common Agreement past the Distribution Date.

(c) If the assignment, novation or amendment of any Common Agreement pursuant
to _Section 5.4(a)_ is not consummated prior to or at the Distribution Date,
then, insofar as reasonably possible (taking into account any applicable
restrictions or considerations, in each case relating to the Tax treatment of
the transactions contemplated hereby, which Tax treatment is specified in the
Tax Matters Agreement) and to the extent permitted by applicable Law:

(i) The Person retaining any such Common Agreement shall thereafter hold the
portion of such Common Agreement to which the other Party is entitled in trust
for the use and benefit and burden of the Person entitled thereto (and at such
Persons sole expense) until the consummation of the assignment, novation or
amendment thereof (or as otherwise determined by the Parties) until the
earlier of (x) two (2) years after the Distribution Date and (ii) the
expiration of such Common Agreement in accordance with its terms;

(ii) The Person retaining any such Common Agreements shall, with respect to
such Common Agreements, use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and
implement mutually acceptable arrangements to place the Person entitled to
receive its portion of the benefits or liabilities of such Common Agreement,
insofar as reasonably possible, in substantially the same position as if such
Common Agreement had been separated as contemplated hereby and so that all the
benefits and burdens relating to such Common Agreement to which such Person is
entitled, including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain,
dominion, ability to enforce the rights under or with respect to and control
and command over the portion of such Common Agreement to which such Person is
entitled, are to inure from and after the Distribution Date to the applicable
member or members of the CBS Group or the Radio Group entitled to the receipt
of such benefit or liability under such Common Agreement; and

 

(iii) Except as set forth in the Ancillary Agreements, CBS shall, consistent
with past practice, allocate to Radio and its Affiliates the applicable _pro_
_rata_ portion of amounts received from and amounts payable to third parties
under any Common Agreements until such Common Agreement is separated pursuant
to _Section 5.4(a)_ ; _provided_ that (A) Radio and its Affiliates will have
no liability or obligation to CBS and its Affiliates for failure to purchase
goods or services under the Common Agreements after the Distribution Date,
except where Radio or one of its Affiliates has, in anticipation of the Final
Distribution and with the written consent of Acquiror, entered into a written
agreement with the applicable third party to extend Radios or such
Affiliates participation under the Common Agreement past the Distribution
Date, and (B) Radio and its Affiliates will not be allocated any portion of
any "clawback" amounts, termination fees or similar payables to third parties
under the Common Agreements as a result of the Final Distribution. Amounts so
allocated to Radio or any of its Affiliates will be treated as a receivable or
payable, as the case may be, of Radio from or to CBS.

present or future Subsidiaries and Affiliates and any of their past, present
or future Representatives, heirs, executors and any of their successors and
assigns (" _CBS Indemnitees_ ") against any and all Losses, as incurred,
arising out of or relating to: (i) the Radio Liabilities, including, after the
Distribution Date, the failure of Radio or any other member of the Radio
Group or any other Person to pay, perform, fulfill, discharge and, to the
extent applicable, comply with, in due course and in full, any such
Liabilities, (ii) any breach by Radio or any other member of the Radio
Group (including Acquiror after the Distribution Date) of any obligations to
be performed by such Party pursuant to this Agreement subsequent to the
Distribution Date and (iii) the Assumed Liabilities, including, the failure of
Radio or any other member of the Radio Group or any other Person to pay,
perform, fulfill, discharge and, to the extent applicable, comply with, in due
course and in full, any such Liabilities.

 

Section 6.2 _Indemnification by CBS_.

 

(a) CBS agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Radio and its past, present or
future Subsidiaries and Affiliates and any of their past, present or future
Representatives, heirs and any of their executors, successors and assigns ("
_Radio Indemnitees_ ") against any and all Losses, as incurred, arising out of
or relating to (i) the Excluded Liabilities, including, the failure of CBS or
any other member of the CBS Group or any other Person to pay, perform,
fulfill, discharge and, to the extent applicable, comply with, in due course
and in full, any such Liabilities, (ii) any breach by CBS or any other
member of the CBS Group of any obligations to be performed by such Party
pursuant to this Agreement subsequent to the Distribution Date or (iii) any
material breach of the representations and warranties set forth in the first
two sentences of Section 5.18 of the Merger Agreement, (iv) any SEC Filings
or other public filings made by CBS (including Radio prior to the Distribution
Date) (other than with respect to any information provided by Acquiror
specifically for inclusion therein), (v) any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, with respect to all information provided
by CBS or Radio specifically for inclusion in (A) the SEC Filings or (B) any
public filings made by Acquiror following the Distribution Date or (vi)
subject to _Article VIII_, CBS will indemnify the Acquiror for any actual
remaining lease payments or any other contractual payments that were part of
the restructurings conducted by the Radio Group or the CBS Group with respect
to the Radio Business prior to January 1, 2017.

 

(b) No claim or cause of action for indemnification under _Section
6.2(a)(iii)_ may be made following the one (1) year anniversary of the
Closing Date, it being understood that in the event notice of any claim for
indemnification under _Section 6.2(a)(iii)_ shall have been given prior to
the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, such
indemnification claim(s) and the representations and warranties that are the
subject thereto shall survive until final resolution thereof.

(c) CBSs obligation to indemnify Radio Indemnitees pursuant to (i) _Section
6.2(a)(i)_ for Losses related to clause (e) of the definition of Excluded
Liabilities and (ii) _Section 6.2(a)(iii)_ 

 



\- 37 -  are subject to the limitation that no indemnification shall be made by CBS
with respect to any claim (including any Losses) until the aggregate amount of
all such Losses for which indemnification may be sought hereunder exceeds
$500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), at which point the Radio Indemnitees shall be
entitled to indemnification for all such Losses. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, only individual claims or series of related claims involving
Losses in excess of $50,000 shall be included in the Deductible or be counted
for determining the amount of Losses to be indemnified to the Radio
Indemnitees pursuant to Section 6.2(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall the obligation of CBS to indemnify Radio Indemnitees with respect
to (A) _ Section __6.2(a_ _)(_ _i_ _)_ for Losses related to clause (e) of
the definition of Excluded Liabilities and (B) _ Section _ _6.2(a)(iii)_
exceed, in the aggregate, $40,000,000.

Section 6.3 _Certain Other Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the rights and obligations of the Parties with respect to
indemnification for Taxes or Tax matters (other than any Taxes or Tax matters
governed by _Section_ __ _ 3.6(a)_ or _Article VIII_ of this Agreement) or
other Losses that are the subject matter of the Tax Matters Agreement shall be
governed solely by the Tax Matters Agreement; and the rights and obligations
of the Parties with respect to any other indemnification or hold
harmless obligation expressly set forth in any other provision of any
Ancillary Agreement shall be governed solely by such provisions.

 

Section 6.4 _Calculation of Indemnification Payments_. The amount which any
Indemnifying Party is required to pay to any Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Agreement shall be reduced (including, but not limited to, retroactively)
by any recovery, judgment, settlement or other amounts actually recovered,
including insurance proceeds, by such Indemnified Party with respect to
such liabilities.

Section 6.5 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) The indemnification procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ are
applicable to any indemnity granted pursuant to this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements (other than the Tax Matters Agreement). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, indemnification procedures with respect to
matters governed by the Tax Matters Agreement shall be governed solely by the
Tax Matters Agreement.

(b) An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of any
matter that an Indemnified Party has determined has given or would reasonably
be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement
(other than a Third-Party Claim, which shall be governed by _Section 6.5(c)_
), within twenty (20) Business Days of such determination, stating the amount
of the Loss claimed, if known, and method of computation thereof, and
containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which
such right of indemnification is claimed by such Indemnified Party or arises;
provided, however _,_ that the failure to provide such notice shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements except and solely to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or liability that it
may have to any Indemnified Party other than under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements.

 

(c) If a claim or demand is made against an Indemnified Party by any Person
who is not a party to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (a " _Third-
Party Claim_ ") as to which such Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or the

 



\- 38 -  Ancillary Agreements (other than the Tax Matters Agreement), such
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party written notice of such
Third-Party Claim, as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than
fifteen (15) days after the receipt by the Indemnified Party of notice of such
Third Party Claim, describing in reasonable detail the basis for any claim for
indemnification hereunder and including copies of all notices and documents
received by the Indemnified Party from third parties relating to such Third
Party Claim (subject to any _bona_ _fide_ claims of attorney-client
privilege); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide notice of
any such Third Party Claim shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any
of its obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements except to
the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure and
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or
liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party other than under this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. The Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third-Party Claim at its
expense and through counsel of its choice and reasonably acceptable to the
applicable Indemnified Party, if it gives notice of its intention to do so to
the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) Business Days of the receipt of the
notice of the Third-Party Claim from the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict
of interest that would make it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of
the Indemnified Party for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to retain its own counsel, in each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified
Party determines counsel is required to participate in such defense, at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party. In the event the Indemnifying Party
exercises the right to undertake any such defense against any such Third-Party
Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all witnesses, pertinent records,
materials and information in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the
Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnifying Party (solely for such purpose), subject to reimbursement of
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Similarly, in the event the Indemnified
Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against any such
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with
the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified
Party all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the
Indemnifying Partys possession or under the Indemnifying Partys control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party (solely
for such purpose), subject to reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses. No such Third-Party Claim may be settled by the Indemnifying Party
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement is
solely for money and includes an unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from any and all liabilities arising out of such action, claim, suit or
proceeding and would not otherwise materially and adversely affect the
Indemnified Party. No such Third-Party Claim may be settled by the Indemnified
Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which

expenses of counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending such Third-
Party Claim if the Third-Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other
equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against the
Indemnified Party which the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after
conferring with its counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for
money damages. If such equitable relief or other relief portion of the Third-
Party Claim can be so separated from that for money damages, the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion relating to money
damages.

extent so provided therein, shall govern the resolution of disputes,
controversies or claims that are the subject of that Ancillary Agreement), the
procedures for discussion, negotiation and arbitration set forth in this 
_Article VII_ shall apply to all disputes, controversies or claims (whether
arising in contract, tort or

 



\- 40 -  otherwise) that may arise out of or relate to, or arise under or in
connection with, this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the validity,

relating hereto or thereto, between or among any member of the CBS Group, on
the one hand, and the Radio Group or Acquiror Group, on the other hand

Section 7.2 _Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) Following the Effective Time, CBS, on the one hand, and Radio and
Acquiror, on the other hand, will use commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve expeditiously any Agreement Dispute on a mutually acceptable
negotiated basis. In furtherance of the foregoing, any member of the CBS

hand, involved in an Agreement Dispute may deliver a notice (an " _Escalation
Notice_ ") demanding an in-person meeting between the chief legal officers or
general counsels (or other designated senior-level management representative)
of each of CBS and Acquiror (or, if CBS, on the one hand, and Radio or
Acquiror, on the other hand, agree, of the appropriate strategic business unit
or division within each such entity). A copy of any such Escalation Notice
shall be given to the chief legal officer or general counsels of CBS and of
Acquiror (which copy shall state that it is an Escalation Notice pursuant to
this _Article VII_ ). Any agenda, location or procedures for such discussions
or negotiations between CBS and Acquiror may be established by CBS, on the
one hand, and Radio and Acquiror, on the other hand, from time to time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the representatives of CBS, on the one hand, and
Radio and Acquiror, on the other hand, shall use their reasonable efforts to
meet within thirty (30) days of the delivery of Escalation Notice (or such
shorter time as is necessary to avoid immediate irreparable injury).

 

(b) If the chief legal officers or general counsels (or other designated
senior-level management representatives) of CBS and Acquiror are not able to
resolve the Agreement Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date of
receipt of the Escalation Notice (or such shorter time as is necessary to
avoid immediate irreparable injury), then the Agreement Dispute shall be
submitted to a committee consisting of one independent director of CBS and

not able to resolve the Agreement Dispute through the processes set forth in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ within sixty (60) days
after the date of receipt of the Escalation Notice (or such shorter time as
is necessary to avoid immediate irreparable injury), such Agreement Dispute
shall be determined, at the request of either CBS, on the one hand, or Radio
and Acquiror, on the other hand, by arbitration, which shall be conducted (i)
by three (3) arbitrators, consisting of one arbitrator appointed by CBS, one
arbitrator appointed by Radio and Acquiror and a third arbitrator appointed by
the two (2) arbitrators appointed by CBS and Radio and Acquiror and (ii) in
accordance with the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association,
or its successor organization (except with respect to the selection of
arbitrators), in effect at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration.
Any request for arbitration pursuant to this paragraph (c) may be made only
after the Person requesting arbitration obtains the prior approval of its
board of directors to make such request. The Parties hereby irrevocably
undertake (x) not to bring any Agreement Dispute before any court or
arbitration tribunal other than as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ and
(y) not to challenge the right of the tribunal to rule over such dispute.

 



\- 41 - (d) The decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon CBS, Radio
and Acquiror, and the expense of the arbitration (including the award of
attorneys fees to the prevailing Party) shall be paid as the arbitrators
determine. The decision of the arbitrators shall be executory, and judgment
thereon may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The seat of
the arbitration shall be New York, New York.

(e) The existence of, and any discussions, negotiations, arbitrations or
other proceedings relating to, any Agreement Dispute shall be considered by
each Party as Confidential Information until such time as a judgment thereon
is sought in a court of competent jurisdiction.

 

(f) An arbitral tribunal constituted under this Agreement may, unless
consolidation would prejudice the rights of any Party, consolidate
an arbitration hereunder with arbitration under any of the Ancillary
Agreements if the arbitration proceedings raise common questions of law or
fact. If two or more arbitral tribunals under this Agreement and on or more of
the Ancillary Documents issue consolidation orders, the order issued first
shall prevail.

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, except as otherwise set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.6_, no member of
the Acquiror Group (including the Radio Group) and no member of the CBS Group
shall have the right to institute judicial proceedings against the other Party
or any Person acting by, through or under such other Party, to enforce the
instituting Partys rights under this Agreement, except that any such member
shall be permitted to seek an injunction in aid of arbitration with respect to
an Agreement Dispute to preserve the status quo during the pendency of any
arbitration proceeding pursuant to paragraph (c) of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_.

 

(h) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any judicial proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement (any such claim being a "
_Covered Claim_ "), shall be heard and determined in any federal or state
court located in the State of Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably submits in respect of Covered Claims for itself and in respect to
its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the aforesaid courts and agrees that it may be served with such legal process
at the address and in the manner set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.9_. Each of
the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding
in respect of Covered Claims (i) any claim that it is not personally subject
to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the
failure to lawfully serve process or the failure to follow the procedures set
forth in clauses (a)-(g) of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, (ii) that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Laws, that (A) the suit, Action or proceeding in any such court
is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, Action or
proceeding is improper and (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts.

Section 7.3 _Continuity of Service and Performance_. Unless otherwise agreed
in writing, CBS, on the one hand, and Radio and Acquiror, on the other hand,
will continue to provide service and honor all other commitments under this
Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement during the course of dispute
resolution pursuant to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ with respect to

trust transfer, as determined by CBS, based on the principles and procedures
set forth in this _Section 8.3(a)_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary (including the definition of "Radio
Business"), the Radio 401(k) Plan shall assume and retain all account balances

Excess 401(k) Plan and CBS Bonus Deferral Plan accounts of a Radio Employee or
Former Radio Employee, Radio shall have caused the Radio Excess 401(k) Plan to
assume and be solely responsible for all liabilities under

applicable Law, from and following the transfer to the Radio Excess 401(k)
Plan of the applicable CBS Excess 401(k) Plan and CBS Bonus Deferral Plan
accounts, participants in the Radio Excess 401(k) Plan may transfer the
investment of their plan accounts out of notional CBS Class B Common Stock
and shall be prohibited from transferring the investment of their plan
accounts or electing the investment of new contributions to their plan
accounts in notional shares of CBS Class B Common Stock. Prior to the
Distribution Date, Radio shall cause the Radio Excess 401(k) Plan to assume
and be solely responsible for all liabilities under the CBS Excess 401(k) Plan
and CBS Bonus Deferral Plan with respect to any individual who becomes a Radio
Employee after the Benefits Transition Date and on or prior to the
Distribution Date, based on the principles and procedures set forth in this
_Section 8.3(b)_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary (including the definition of "Radio Business"), the Radio Excess
401(k) Plan shall assume and retain all Liabilities of any former employee of

following the date a Radio Employee or Former Radio Employee becomes disabled
under a long-term disability plan or program of the CBS Group, in each
case, without regard to whether the events giving rise to the cost or expense

ARTICLE IX

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

Section 9.1 _Limitation of Liability_. Neither CBS nor Radio (including
Acquiror after the Distribution Date) shall be liable to the other for any
(a) exemplary or punitive damages of the other party or (b) special, indirect,
incidental or consequential damages or lost profits, in each case, arising in
connection with this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing shall
not apply to each Partys indemnification obligations for liabilities to third
parties to the extent set forth in _Article VI_.

 

Section 9.2 _Public Announcements_. From and after the Distribution Date, each
of Acquiror and Radio, on the one hand, and CBS, on the other hand, shall
consult with the other Party before issuing, and give the other Party the
opportunity to review and comment upon, that portion of any press release or
other public statements that relates to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except (a) as may be required by applicable Law, court process
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system; (b) as otherwise
set forth in this Agreement; (c) as relates to the reporting by CBS of
financial information for periods prior to the Distribution Date or (d) as is
substantially consistent with information contained in prior public statements
made in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_.

 

Section 9.3 _Further Assurances_. Each Party agrees to execute, acknowledge,
deliver, file, record and publish such further certificates, amendments to
certificates, instruments and documents, and do all such other acts and things
as may be required by Law, or as may be required to carry out the intent and
purposes of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
and the transactions contemplated thereby. On or prior to the Distribution
Date, CBS and Radio shall take all actions as may be necessary to approve the
stock-based employee benefit plans of Radio in order to satisfy
the requirement of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. Prior to the
Distribution Date, if one or more of the Parties identifies any

 



\- 49 -  commercial or other service that is needed to assure a smooth and orderly
transition of the businesses in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that is not otherwise governed by the
provisions of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or any other Ancillary
Agreement, the Parties will cooperate in determining whether there is a
mutually acceptable arms-length basis on which the other Party will provide
such service.

Section 9.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
Merger Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, each Party will be responsible
for the fees and expenses of such Party.

 

Section 9.5 _Waiver_. The observance of any term of this Agreement may be
waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively
or prospectively) by the Party entitled to enforce such term, but such waiver
shall be effective only if it is in writing signed by a duly authorized
officer of the Party against which such waiver is to be asserted;  _provided_
that in the event Radio or any member of the Radio Group is the Party against
whom such a waiver is asserted, such waiver must be signed by the authorized
representative of Acquiror. Unless otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, no delay or omission on the part of any Party in exercising
any right or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any waiver on the part of any Party of any right or privilege under
this Agreement operate as a waiver of any other right or privilege under this
Agreement, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or privilege
preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right or privilege under this Agreement. No failure by either Party to take
any action or assert any right or privilege hereunder shall be deemed to be a
waiver of such right or privilege in the event of the continuation or
repetition of the circumstances giving rise to such right unless expressly
waived in writing by the Party against whom the existence of such waiver is
asserted.

Section 9.6  _Remedies_. Each of CBS, on the one hand, and Acquiror and
Radio, on the other hand, acknowledges and agrees that under certain
circumstances the breach by CBS or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, or
Acquiror and Radio or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand, of a term
or provision of this Agreement will materially and irreparably harm the other
Party, that money damages will accordingly not be an adequate remedy for such
breach and that the non-defaulting Party, in its sole discretion and in
addition to its rights under this Agreement and any other remedies it may have
at law or in equity, may apply to any court of law or equity of
competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or other injunctive
relief in order to enforce or prevent any breach of the provisions of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Acquiror shall, during the term of this
Agreement, have the right to enforce specifically the obligations of CBS and
Radio set forth herein. The Parties agree that they will not contest the
appropriateness of specific performance as a remedy.

 

Section 9.7 _Performance_. Each of the Parties shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be performed all actions, agreements and
obligations set forth herein to be performed by any Affiliate of such Party.

Section 9.8 _Successors and Assignment_. Except for any assignment by CBS,
Radio or Acquiror to its successor (whether by operation of law or otherwise),
this Agreement may not be assigned by any Party (whether by operation of law
or otherwise) without the express written consent of the other Party (which
consent may be granted or withheld in such Partys sole discretion). Subject
to the immediately preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding

 



\- 50 -  upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and permitted assigns. For the purposes of this Agreement, a
"successor" shall include any entity that is a legal successor to either
Party as a result of a sale or acquisition of such Party, whether by merger,
consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or sale of all or
substantially all of such Partys assets or stock.

 

Section 9.9 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be given or
made (and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made upon receipt) by
delivery in person, by overnight courier service, by facsimile or electronic
transmission with receipt confirmed (followed by delivery of an original
via overnight courier service) or by registered or certified mail (postage
prepaid, return receipt requested) to the respective Parties at the following

of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under
any Law or as a matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions
of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long
as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the

referenced herein (including the Merger Agreement and any Ancillary

contemporaneous oral agreements, negotiations, discussions, writings,
understandings, commitments and conversations with respect to such subject
matter and there are no agreements or understandings between the Parties other
than those set forth or referred to herein or therein. In the event of
a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any matters specifically
and expressly governed by the Merger Agreement or one of the Ancillary
Agreements, the terms of the Merger Agreement or such Ancillary Agreement, as
applicable, shall govern. Except as provided herein, this Agreement will not
apply to matters relating to Taxes, which shall be exclusively governed by the
Tax Matters Agreement.

the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and

of Radio under this Agreement, including under _Sections 3.1(b)_ , _3.4_ ,
_3.5_ ,  _5.4(a)_ , _9.5_ , _9.6_ , _9.14_ and _Article VI_. As of the
Effective Time, this Agreement shall be binding on Acquiror and Acquiror
shall, as between CBS and Acquiror, be subject to the obligations and

respective successors and permitted assigns will acquire or have any benefit,
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement, except (i) as
contemplated in the preceding sentence and (ii) for the provisions of _Article
VI_ with respect to indemnification of Radio Indemnitees, CBS Indemnitees or

common law, statute or otherwise) shall in all respects be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, including all
matters of construction, validity and performance, in each case without
reference to any conflict of Law rules that might lead to the application of
the Laws of any other jurisdiction (other than Section 5-1401 and Section
5-1402 of the General Obligations Law of the State of New York).

Section 9.14  _Amendment_. No provision of this Agreement, including any
Schedules to this Agreement, may be amended, supplemented or modified except

such Schedules to this Agreement, as applicable, signed by CBS, Radio and
Acquiror.

in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The descriptive
headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not

doubt, "consistent with past practice" when used with respect to the members
of the Radio Group means the past practice of any members of the Radio Group
and the CBS Group with respect the operations of the Radio Group. Except as
otherwise expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement, any provision herein that contemplates the agreement,
approval or consent of, or exercise of any right of, a Party, such Party may
give or withhold such agreement, approval or consent, or exercise such right,
in its sole and absolute discretion.

executed counterpart of this Agreement.

employee, incorporator, member, partner, shareholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney or representative of either CBS, on the one hand, or Radio

(a) Except as expressly set forth in the Merger Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, the covenants, representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement, and liability
for the breach of any obligations contained herein, will survive each of the
Merger, Radio Reorganization and the Final Distribution and will remain
in full force and effect.

(b) CBS agrees that (i) the representations and warranties set forth in the
first two sentences of Section 5.18 of the Merger Agreement are incorporated
herein by reference, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the

all uses of the Licensed Property that are consistent with the uses of the
Licensed Property by the Radio Business during the one-year period prior to
the Effective Date are not prohibited by this Section 2.3. 

2.4 _Further Prohibited Uses of Licensed Property_. The Licensee shall not use
the Licensed Property to identify audio-visual content including news,
sports, weather, traffic reporting or other videos or video services
(including, video-on-demand or video streaming, syndication of video
content or video streams, or any other distribution of audio-visual content),
except to the extent so used by the Radio Business as of the Effective Date,
such as (x) in

 



5  simultaneous video streams or recordings that are created by the Licensees
placement of camera(s) in a terrestrial radio studio to capture the
simultaneous broadcast of audio programming of a radio station owned and
operated by the Licensee or (y) musical performances and associated music
videos; or (z) audio-visual recordings of interviews streaming from or
recorded at speaker series, panel discussions or conferences hosted by the
Licensee (" _Permitted Video Use_ ").

2.5 _Permitted_ _Sublicensees_. In addition to Section 2.8(c), the Licensee
may not license or authorize any other Person to use the Licensed Property,
except that the Licensee may grant limited, non-assignable (including non-
assignable in an Acquisition) sublicenses of its rights under Section 2.1 to
those third parties who have been granted licenses or sublicenses of the
Licensed Property by Licensor or any of its Affiliates in connection with the
operation of the Radio Business prior to the Effective Date ( _provided_ that
the sublicense to such third party is for uses substantially similar to those
permitted by Licensor and its Affiliates during the one year period prior to
the Effective Date), or to any third parties for which the Licensee obtains
prior written consent of Licensor (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , in each case, that (a) Licensee has
sent Licensor written notice with detailed information regarding all proposed
uses of the Licensed Property by such third party (including identification of
all types of uses and media in connection with which the Licensed Property
will be used); and (b) such third parties agree to comply with all terms and
conditions hereunder applicable to the Licensee (each such third party
approved by Licensor, a " _Permitted_ _Sublicensee_ "); provided
that Licensor may terminate the purported sublicense to use the Licensed
Property granted to any purported Permitted Sublicensee at any time if the
transfer or assignment of such Licensed Property to such Permitted Sublicensee
occurred in violation of the foregoing requirements of this Section 2.5.

Notwithstanding the grant of any sublicense, the Licensee shall remain liable
for compliance by each Permitted Sublicensee with all terms and conditions of
this Agreement applicable to the Licensee and such terms and conditions shall
be deemed to be applicable to each Permitted Sublicensee.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee may engage manufacturers and service
providers to apply the Trademarks to Licensees promotional goods of the
types and in the manner used during the one year period prior to the
Effective Date or otherwise use the Trademarks in connection with the
advertising or marketing of Licensees goods or services solely at the
direction and on behalf of the Licensee (e.g. t-shirt or banner manufacturer,
or newspaper carrying an advertisement) without prior consent or approval from
Licensor.

 

2.6 _Licensor_ __ _s Restrictions_. The Licensor agrees not to use or license
(or cause or induce others to do so) the trademark "CBS RADIO" for the
operation of a terrestrial radio network in the United States for four (4)
years following the Effective Date.

 

2.7 _Licensor_ __ _s Reserved Rights_. All rights of the Licensor and its
Affiliates not expressly granted by the Licensor to the Licensee pursuant to
this Agreement are reserved without exception or limitation.

 



6 2.8 _Licensee s Acknowledgement Concerning the Licensed Property_ _._ Subject
to Section 2.6 and the other CBS Brand License Agreements, the Licensee
hereby acknowledges and agrees that:

(a) No Claims Against CBS. For the avoidance of doubt, CBS and its Affiliates
have the right to use (and Licensee shall not have any basis to object to or
make claims against CBS or its Affiliates for their use of):

 

(i) the Licensed Property;

 

(ii) the Eye Design, "CBS", "CBS NEWS" and "CBS RADIO NEWS"; and

 

(iii) "WCBS", "KCBS" and "CBS SPORTS RADIO" (which are subject to other CBS
Brand License Agreements);

in each case either alone or in combination with other symbols, words, phrases
or logos (including the Trademarks in combination with "TV" or any other term
indicating audio or audio-visual content or other media) for any uses in
connection with any goods and services (including domain names), whether known
as of the date of this Agreement or created in the future, including use in
association with any activities of CBS or its Affiliates television station
brand names, such as WCBS and KCBS, and related activity and for any audio
products or otherwise;

 

(b) _FCC Licenses_. The Licensee shall not grant consent to any Person to use
any of the Licensed Property as call letters, even if its status at the
Federal Communications Commission would permit the Licensee to provide such
consent; and

(c) _Risk of Confusion_. The Licensee shall cooperate with any reasonable
requests of Licensor in connection with any Licensed Services that may create
a risk of confusion with any current or anticipated business of CBS or any of
its Affiliates.

 



   3 | Licensees Use of the Licensed Property 
---|--- 

3.1 _Brand Guidelines and Logo Changes_. The Licensee shall use the
Trademarks in accordance with the Brand Guidelines, comply with all applicable
Laws and the quality standards set forth in Section 3.3, and shall observe all
reasonable directions given by the Licensor as to the representations of the
Trademarks. The Licensee is not permitted to adopt any new visual
representation of the Trademarks or to use, reproduce or represent any of the
Trademarks in any form or manner that is not already in use by the
Radio Business as of the Effective Date, unless prior written approval is
provided by the Licensor, not to be unreasonably withheld. The Licensee shall
adopt any new visual representation of the Trademarks that may be required
from time to time by the Licensor upon reasonable prior written notice to
Licensee.

3.2 _Licensor_ __ _s Quality Control_. The Licensee agrees to provide
representative samples of any goods, services and materials to or in which the
Licensed Property is affixed or incorporated, including marketing and
promotional materials, audio recordings of content and all 

 



7  other uses of the Licensed Property by the Licensee (whether written,
electronic or recorded in any other medium), as reasonably requested by the
Licensor. If at any time the Licensor notifies the Licensee in writing that a
deficiency exists in the form, manner or quality of any goods, services or
materials to or in which the Licensed Property is affixed or incorporated, the
Licensee will use diligent efforts to remedy such deficiency promptly and
provide the Licensor with evidence of same.

3.3 _Licensee_ __ _s Obligations / Quality Control_. In using the Licensed
Property, the Licensee shall:

(a) maintain such quality standards for the Radio Business that are in place
as of the Effective Date;

(b) not do any act which would reasonably be expected to dilute or materially
weaken the strength of the Licensed Property, or render the Trademarks
generic or invalid (it being understood that uses of the Licensed Property
that are consistent with those uses by the Radio Business in use during the
one year period prior to the Effective Date shall not be considered
violations of this Section 3.3(b));

(c) conduct its business and operations in a manner that would not reasonably
be expected to have an adverse effect on the reputation of Licensor or its
goodwill associated with the Licensed Property (it being understood that the
conduct of the Radio Business in the manner in which it was conducted during
the one year period prior to the Effective Date shall not be considered a
breach of this Section 3.3(c));

(d) not perform any act or fail to act in any way that could reasonably be
expected to injure, denigrate or otherwise, devalue the Licensed Property or
the goodwill or reputation of the Licensor or any of the Licensors Affiliates
(it being understood that the conduct of the Radio Business in the manner in
which it was conducted during the one year period prior to the Effective Date
shall not be considered a breach of this Section 3.3(d)). The Licensee hereby
agrees that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the
Licensees employees and other personnel (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
the employees and other personnel of its Permitted Sublicensees) do not make
any offensive remarks, commit any criminal act, or commit any other act which
could reasonably be expected to reflect unfavorably upon the Licensed
Property or the Licensor or its Affiliates in any material respect; and, in
the event of any such conduct, the Licensee will work with the Licensor to
promptly minimize any resulting adverse impact on the Licensed Property and
to remedy any such conduct (without limiting other remedies available to the
Licensor under this Agreement); and

 

(e) not make any representation or do any act which may be taken to indicate
that it has any right, title or interest in or to the ownership of any of the
Licensed Property other than the licensed rights conferred by this Agreement.

3.4 _Legal Lines_. To the extent the legends, markings, and notices referred
to below in this Section 3.4 were used by the Radio Business in connection
with uses of the Trademarks prior to the Effective Date, the Licensee shall
where reasonably practicable cause the following legend to appear on all
marketing and promotional materials on or in connection with which the
Trademarks are used:

"The Eye Design® and CBS RADIO® are Registered Trademarks of CBS Broadcasting
Inc. All Rights Reserved."

 



8 and/or such legends, markings, and notices as the Licensor may reasonably
request in order to give appropriate written notice of any trademark, trade
name or other rights therein; but failure to use such symbol shall not be
deemed a breach of this Agreement that could give rise to termination pursuant
to Section 10.2. Licensee agrees that upon reasonable request from Licensor
to add the aforementioned legend, Licensee will take all reasonable steps
necessary to add such legend.

 

3.5 _Domain Name Fees_. The Licensee shall be responsible for all fees in
connection with the registration of domain names that Licensor agrees to add
to Schedule 1 as Domain Names, and registration and renewal of registration of
the Domain Names during the Term and during the eighteen (18) months following
the end of the Term for redirection as described in Section 3.6. 

3.6 _Domain Name Cooperation_. Subject to the Licensees compliance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor shall cooperate with the
Licensee to enable the Domain Names to be directed to the appropriate servers
for the websites relating to the Radio Business. Furthermore, for a period of
eighteen (18) months following the end of the Term, Licensor agrees to
maintain the registrations and redirect traffic from the Domain Names to new
website addresses designated by Licensee, with an appropriate notice agreed to
by the Parties indicating that the applicable web site addresses
have changed.

3.7 _Phase Out._ The Licensee shall use all reasonable efforts to reduce its
usage of the Licensed Property for which a license is granted pursuant to
Article 2, including by completing the removal of the Licensed Property from
all goods, services and materials in the Licensees possession or control,
such that, as at the expiration of the Term, the Licensee will have ceased
and discontinued all use of the Licensed Property in accordance with Section
10.4; _provided_ that in the event of any de minimis use that continues after
expiration or termination of the Term, Licensee shall quickly after becoming
aware thereof discontinue such use, except as otherwise provided in Section
7.24(c) of the Merger Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensee
shall not commence any new uses of the Licensed Property during the Term not
expressly permitted hereunder by Section 2.1, unless approved in writing by
the Licensor.

decisions made by the Licensor in connection and in accordance with this

assistance as the Licensor may reasonably request in furtherance of the
purpose of this Agreement, and to cooperate with the Licensor in connection
therewith, as requested.

 

4.4 If, in breach of this Agreement, the Licensee registers, or applies to
register, any copyright, trademark, trade name, domain name or other
designation identical or confusingly similar to the Licensed Property, "CBS"

registration or application to the Licensor or, at the Licensors request,
take all steps necessary to abandon, cancel or withdraw, as requested, such
registration or application.

trademark, trade name, domain name or other designation identical or
confusingly similar to, any of the Licensed Property, "CBS" or the Eye Design
or any mark which combines the Licensed Property with any other trademark,
trade name or domain name or other designation, unless permitted under
another written agreement with Licensor to use a brand related to Licensors
licensed content (e.g. CBS SPORTS RADIO).

Property.

16 12.9 _Waivers_. The observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively) by the Party entitled to enforce such term (each such entity, a
" _Waiving Entity_ "), but such waiver shall be effective only if it is in
writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Waiving Entity against
which such waiver is to be asserted. Unless otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, no delay or omission on the part of any Party in exercising
any right or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any Party of any right or
privilege under this Agreement operate as a waiver of any other right or
privilege under this Agreement, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right or privilege preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or privilege under this Agreement. No failure by
either Party to take any action or assert any right or privilege hereunder
shall be deemed to be a waiver of such right or privilege in the event of the
continuation or repetition of the circumstances giving rise to such right
unless expressly waived in writing by the entity against whom the existence of
such waiver is asserted. The rights and remedies of the Parties hereunder are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would
otherwise have hereunder.

 

12.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or as a matter
of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to either the Licensor or the
Licensee. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Licensor and the Licensee shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Licensor and the Licensee as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

12.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except to the extent that this Agreement
shall benefit Acquiror, as set forth explicitly herein, and to the extent of
any indemnification of any Licensee Indemnified Parties and Licensor
Indemnified Parties, as set forth in Section 11, this Agreement is for the
sole benefit of the Licensor and the Licensee and their permitted successors
and assigns and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any
specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement.

12.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by each Party in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or
portable document format (PDF) shall be as effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

governed by the following rules of construction: (a) words in the singular
shall be held to include the plural and vice versa, and words of one gender

   2 | Grant of Rights 
---|--- 

2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and for
no additional royalties or consideration apart from the consideration
provided to CBS in connection with the Separation, each Licensor hereby grants
to the Applicable Licensee (as set forth on Schedule 1) for the applicable
Licensed Radio Station, a limited, non-exclusive (but subject to Section
2.6), non-assignable and non-transferrable (except as set forth in Section
12.7), non-sublicensable (except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.5_) license
in the Licensed Market (except as set forth in Section 2.2) for a period not
to exceed the Term applicable to such use to:

(a) use the Trademarks as part of the Radio Station Branding including on
terrestrial radio, online, digital and Promotional Use and distribution of
the Radio Station broadcasts and simultaneous audio streams of the Radio
Station broadcasts on audio-only media, and via audio-only technology and
audio-only distribution methods now known or later developed during the Term,
in each case solely to the extent used with a Radio Indicator for any audio
use and any Permitted Video Use (except that de minimis use of the Trademarks
in audio only content without a Radio Indicator (i.e. audio only use of "KYW
News coming up on the hour") is permitted hereunder);

(b) use the Trademarks as part of the Radio Station Call Letters solely to
the extent used with a Radio Indicator (except that de minimis use of a
shortened form of the trademarks "WCBS" and "KCBS" in audio-only content,
solely to the extent used with a Radio Indicator but never as
primary branding, is permitted hereunder); and

(c) subject to Section 3.6, use the Domain Names;

 

in each case under the foregoing (a)-(c) solely as used to identify the
Station Business consistent with the manner and extent of such use as of the
Effective Date (the foregoing collectively referred to herein as the "
_Licensed Services_ "); _provided_ that Licensee shall take reasonable efforts
to wind-down and cease such licensed use of the Eye Design as soon as
practicable after the Effective Date, and the Licensed Property as required
in order to meet its obligations under Sections 3.7 and 10.4, and, in any
event, no later than the expiration of the applicable Term.

 

2.2 _Licensed Market Uses_ _._ Under the license granted pursuant to Section
2.1, the Licensees may use the Licensed Property for the Licensed Services
only in the Licensed Market; _provided_ , _however_ , the Parties hereto
acknowledge that the Licensees are permitted to use the

 



6  Licensed Property for terrestrial radio broadcasting, and related online,
digital uses and Promotional Use for providing the Licensed Services and the
marketing and promotion thereof to users and consumers which are solely
directed to the Licensed Market and the Parties acknowledge that such
broadcasts and related online, digital uses or Promotional Uses may be
accessed or consumed by users or consumers outside the License Market ("
_Spill-Over Use_ "), and Licensees are permitted to use the Licensed Property
for the Licensed Services directed outside the Licensed Market solely for
joint promotions that involve other Licensed Radio Stations (" _Multi Market
Promotion_ "). Licensees may not direct use of the Licensed Property to
terrestrial radio, online or digital users or consumers outside the Licensed
Market, _except_ Spill-Over Use and Multi Market Promotion will not be a
breach of Section 2.1 nor this Section 2.2.

2.3 _Prohibited Uses of Licensed Property_.

 

The Licensees may use the Licensed Property only in the applicable Format and
may not use the Licensed Property for any good or service or in any manner
that is: (a) pornographic or reasonably considered by Licensors as offensive;
or (b) unlawful or obscene (as determined in accordance with applicable
Federal Communications Commission standards). The Parties acknowledge and
agree that all uses of the Licensed Property that are consistent with the
uses of the Licensed Property by the Radio Business during the one year period
prior to the Effective Date are not prohibited by this Section 2.3.

 

2.4 _Further Prohibited Uses of Licensed Property_ _._ The Licensees shall not
use the Licensed Property to identify audio-visual content including news,
sports, weather, traffic reporting or other videos or video services
(including, video-on-demand or video streaming, syndication of video
content or video streams, or any other distribution of audio-visual content),
except (a) in simultaneous video streams or recordings that are created by a
Licensees placement of camera(s) in a terrestrial radio studio to capture the
simultaneous broadcast of audio programming of a Station Business; (b) in
musical performances and associated music videos; (c) in audio-visual
recordings of interviews streaming from or recorded at speaker series, panel
discussions or conferences hosted by a Licensee, a Permitted Sublicensee, or
a Licensed Radio Station; and (d) use of promotional video on Social Digital
Platforms provided that such video: (i) is less than two (2) minutes, (ii) is
promotional of the Radio Business in nature and not a separately marketable
video product, and (iii) is not a series or stream of news, traffic, sports or
weather reporting including updates; in each case always used with a Radio
Indicator (" _Permitted Video Use_ "). To the extent that a Licensee wishes
to create and distribute audio-visual content other than Permitted Video Use,
the Licensee (i) may not use the Licensed Property or any term confusingly
similar thereto in connection therewith and (ii) must develop and use a name
to identify the applicable Station Business and other identifiers for such
audio-visual content in each case that does not include (in whole or in part)
the Licensed Property, the Eye Design or the name and trademark "CBS" or any
term that is confusingly similar to any of the foregoing (e.g. for such uses,
a Licensee may use a name such as "Newsradio 1060" but not "KYW Newsradio
1060").

 

2.5 _Permitted Sublicensees._ In addition to Section 2.8, a Licensee may not
license or authorize any other Person to use the Licensed Property, except
that a Licensee may grant limited, non-assignable (including non-assignable in
an Acquisition) sublicenses of its rights under Section 2.1 to any Affiliate
providing support or services to such Licensee in connection

 



7  with the applicable Station Business as well as to those third parties who
have been granted licenses or sublicenses of the Licensed Property by
Licensors or any of their Affiliates in connection with the operation of the
Radio Business during the one year period prior to the Effective Date (
_provided_ that the sublicense to such third party is for uses substantially
similar to those permitted by Licensors and their Affiliates during the one
year period prior to the Effective Date), or to any third parties for which
such Licensee obtains prior written consent of Licensors (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld); _provided_ that (a) such Licensee has sent
Licensors written notice with detailed information regarding all proposed
uses of the Licensed Property by such third party (including identification of
all types of uses and media in connection with which the Licensed Property
will be used); and (b) such third parties agree to comply with all terms and
conditions hereunder applicable to the Licensees (each a " _Permitted
Sublicensee_ "); _provided_ that Licensors may terminate the purported
sublicense to use the Licensed Property granted to any purported Permitted
Sublicensee at any time if the transfer or assignment of such Licensed
Property to such Permitted Sublicensee occurred in violation of the foregoing
requirements of this Section 2.5. Notwithstanding the grant of any
sublicenses, the Licensees shall remain liable for compliance by such
Permitted Sublicensees with all terms and conditions of this Agreement
applicable to the Licensees and such terms and conditions shall be deemed to
be applicable to each Permitted Sublicensee. For the avoidance of doubt, there
is nothing in this Agreement that permits any Licensees use of Licensed
Property at radio stations other than those listed on Schedule 1.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensees may engage manufacturers and service
providers to apply the Trademarks to Licensees promotional goods of
the types and in the manners used prior to the Effective Date, or otherwise
use the Trademarks in connection with the advertising or marketing of
Licensees Licensed Services solely at the direction and on behalf of the
Licensee (e.g. t-shirt or banner manufacturer or newspaper carrying an
advertisement) without prior consent or approval from Licensor.

 

2.6 _Licensors_ __ _Restrictions_. The Licensors agree not to use or license
(or cause or induce or permit others to do so) any Licensed Property in
connection with the operation of a terrestrial radio network or with any Radio
Indicators during the applicable Term for such Licensed Property. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Licensors use of the Licensed Property without Radio
Indicators, and the marks "CBS" or "CBS RADIO NEWS" (either alone or in
combination with other symbols, words, phrases or logos) is not prohibited by
the foregoing _._ The Licensors shall not grant consent to any third party to
use any of the Licensed Property as call letters for a radio station, even if
its status at the Federal Communications Commission would permit the Licensors
to provide such consent.

 

2.7 _Licensors_ __ _Reserved Rights_. All rights of the Licensors and their
Affiliates not expressly granted by the Licensors to the Licensees pursuant
to this Agreement are reserved without exception or limitation.

2.8 _Licensees_ __ _ Acknowledgement Concerning the Licensed Property_ _._
Subject to Section 2.6 and the other CBS Brands License Agreements, the
Licensees hereby acknowledge and agree that:

 

(a) _No_ _Claims_ _Against_ _CBS_. For the avoidance of doubt, CBS and its
Affiliates have the right to use (and Licensees shall not have any basis to
object to or make claims against CBS or its Affiliates for their use of):

(i) the Licensed Property;

 



8 (ii) the Eye Design, "CBS" and "CBS RADIO NEWS" in each case either alone or
in combination with other symbols, words, phrases or logos (including the
Trademarks in combination with "TV" (e.g., "KYW-TV") or any other term
indicating audio or audio-visual content or other media) for any uses in
connection with any goods and services (including domain names), whether known
as of the date of this Agreement or created in the future, including use in
association with any activities of CBS or its Affiliates television station
brand names, such as WCBS and KCBS, and related activity and for any audio
products or otherwise; or

 

(iii) "CBS RADIO" and "CBS SPORTS RADIO" (which are subject to other CBS Brand
License Agreements).

 

(b) _FCC_ _Licenses_. The Licensees shall not grant consent to any Person to
use any of the Licensed Property as call letters, even if its status at the
Federal Communications Commission would permit the Licensees to provide such
consent.

(c) _Risk_ _of_   _Confusion_. The parties shall cooperate at Licensors cost
(approved by Licensors in advance) with any reasonable requests of Licensors
in connection with any Licensed Services that may create a risk of confusion
with any current or anticipated business of CBS or any of its Affiliates.

---|--- 

3.1 _Brand Guidelines and Logo Changes_.

(a) The Licensees shall use the Trademarks in accordance with the Brand
Guidelines as amended by the Licensors from time to time with written notice
to the Licensees, shall observe all reasonable directions given by any
Licensor as to the representations of the Trademarks, and shall adopt any new
visual representation of the Trademarks that may be required from time
to time by the Licensors upon reasonable prior written notice to Licensees
(each a " _Guideline Update_ ") and shall comply with all applicable Laws and
the quality standards set forth in Section 3.3, _provided_ that:

 

(i) any Guideline Update required by Licensors would not reasonably be
expected to effectively prohibit the use of the Trademarks by Licensees;

 



9 (ii) if in any given 12 month period, the Guideline Updates for a Licensed
Radio Station, individually or in the aggregate, require Licensees to expend
material funds or resources to implement, then Licensors may not require any
further Guideline Updates for such Licensed Radio Station which Licensees
reasonably expects would require, individually or in the aggregate, the
expenditure of material funds or resources for the subsequent one year period;
and

 

(iii) Licensee shall have six (6) months from receipt of Licensors
notification of a Guideline Update to comply with such update, _provided_
that Licensees shall use reasonable efforts to promptly complete all necessary
changes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensees shall not be required to
implement any Guideline Update with respect to inventory, goods, material or
other products existing as of the date Licensees were notified of such
Guideline Update.

(b) The Parties anticipate that the Licensees may wish to alter the Radio
Station Branding during the Term (in addition to the alterations contemplated
by Section 3.7), and Licensees shall obtain Licensors prior written approval
(not to be unreasonably withheld) before adopting any new visual
representation of the Trademarks or to use, reproduce or represent any of the
Trademarks in any form or manner that is not already in use in the Station
Businesses as of the Effective Date.

 

3.2 _Licensors  Quality Control_. The Licensees agree to provide
representative samples of any goods, services and materials to or in which
the Licensed Property is affixed or incorporated, including marketing and
promotional materials, audio recordings of content and all other uses of the
Licensed Property by the Licensees (whether written, electronic or recorded in
any other medium), as reasonably requested by the Licensors. If at any time a
Licensor notifies a Licensee in writing that a deficiency exists in the form,
manner or quality of any goods, services or materials to or in which the
Licensed Property is affixed or incorporated, the Licensee will use diligent
efforts to remedy such deficiency promptly and provide such Licensor with
evidence of same.

 

3.3 _Licensees_ __ _Obligations / Quality Control_. In using the Licensed
Property, each Licensee shall at each Licensed Radio Station:

(a) maintain such quality standards for its business and operations in
connection with each Licensed Radio Station that are in place as of the
Effective Date, as well as any higher quality standards observed by the
applicable Licensor or its Affiliates from time to time which are communicated
to Licensees;

 

(b) not do any act which would reasonably be expected to dilute or materially
weaken the strength of the Licensed Property or render the Trademarks generic
or invalid (it being understood that uses of the Licensed Property that are
consistent with those uses by the Radio Business in the one year period prior
to the Effective Date shall not be considered a breach of this
Section 3.3(b));

(c) conduct its business and operations in a manner that would not reasonably
be expected to have adverse effect on the reputation of Licensors or their
goodwill associated

 



10  with the Licensed Property (it being understood that the conduct of the
Radio Business in a manner consistent with how it was conducted during the one
year period prior to the Effective Date shall not be considered a breach of
this Section 3.3(c));

(d) not perform any act or fail to act in any way that could reasonably
be expected to injure, denigrate or otherwise, devalue the Licensed Property,
or the goodwill or reputation, of the Licensors or any of the Licensors
Affiliates (it being understood that actions and inactions consistent with the
conduct of the Radio Business during the one year period prior to the
Effective Date shall not be considered breaches of this Section 3.3(d)). The
Licensees hereby agree that they will use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that the Licensees employees and other personnel (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, the employees and other personnel of their Permitted
Sublicensees) do not make any offensive remarks, commit any criminal act, or
commit any other act which could reasonably be expected to reflect
unfavorably upon the Licensed Property or the Licensors or their Affiliates in
any material respect; and, in the event of any such conduct, the Licensees
will work with the Licensors to promptly minimize any resulting adverse impact
on the Licensed Property and to remedy any such conduct (without limiting
other remedies available to the Licensors under this Agreement); and

 

(e) not make any representation or do any act which may be taken to indicate
that it has any right, title or interest in or to the ownership of any of the
Licensed Property other than the licensed rights conferred by this Agreement.

3.4 _Legal Lines_. Each Licensee shall where practicable cause a legend in
the form set out in Schedule 2 to appear on all marketing and promotional
materials on or in connection with which any Trademark that has a registration
set forth on Schedule 1 is used, and/or such legends, markings, and notices
as the applicable Licensor may reasonably request in order to give appropriate
written notice of any trademark, trade name or other rights therein; but
failure to use such symbol shall not be deemed a breach of this
Agreement that could give rise to termination pursuant to Section 10.2.
Licensees agree that upon reasonable request from Licensors to add the
aforementioned legend, Licensees will take all reasonable steps necessary to
add such legend.

 

3.5 _Domain Name Fees_. The Licensees shall be responsible for all fees in
connection with the registration of any Domain Names that a Licensor agrees
to add to Schedule 1 and renewal of registration of the Domain Names during
the applicable Term and the term of redirection set forth in Section 3.6.

 

3.6 _Domain Name Cooperation_. Subject to the Licensees compliance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensors shall cooperate with
the Licensees to enable the Domain Names to be directed to the appropriate
servers for the websites relating to the Station Business. Furthermore, for a
period of eighteen (18) months following the end of the applicable Term,
Licensors agree to redirect traffic from the Domain Names to new website
addresses designated by Licensees, with an appropriate notice agreed to by the
Parties indicating that the applicable web site addresses have changed.

 

3.7 _Phase Out Eye Design_. The Licensees shall use all reasonable efforts to
reduce their usage of the Eye Design for which a license is granted pursuant
to Article 2, including by completing the removal of the Eye Design from all
goods, services and materials in the

 



11  Licensees possession or control, such that, within twelve (12) months after
the Split-Off, the Licensees will have ceased and discontinued all use of the
Eye Design; _provided_ that if Licensees wish to replace any usage of the Eye
Design with any new logo incorporating the Licensed Property (other than, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Eye Design), Licensees shall propose to
Licensors any such new logos no later than six (6) months after the Effective
Date, and Licensors shall consider such proposal in good faith. A Licensee is
not in breach of this Agreement if it inadvertently makes de minimis uses of
the Eye Design in contravention of its obligations, so long as it quickly
ceases use once such use is discovered except as otherwise provided in Section
7.24(c) of the Merger Agreement.

 

3.8 _Phase Out Other Licensed Property_. The Licensee shall use all reasonable
efforts to reduce its usage of the Licensed Property WCBS and KCBS for which
a license is granted pursuant to Article 2, including by completing the
removal of such Licensed Property from all goods, services and materials in
the Licensees possession or control, such that, as at the expiration of
the applicable Term with respect to the usage of such Licensed Property, the
Licensee will have ceased and discontinued all use of such Licensed Property
in accordance with Section 10.4, except as otherwise provided in Section
7.24(c) of the Merger Agreement. A Licensee is not in breach of this
Agreement if it makes de minimis use of a Licensed Property in contravention
of its obligations, so long as it quickly ceases use once it discovers such
use, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.24(c) of the Merger Agreement.

Agreement, to execute any other documents or other materials or provide
such assistance as the Licensors may reasonably request in furtherance of the
purpose of this Agreement, and to cooperate with the Licensors in connection
therewith, as requested. Licensees may request Licensors seek 

 



12  trademark registration of any Licensed Property with a Radio Indicator in
the name of a Licensor, and if such Licensor agrees, Licensees must promptly
reimburse Licensors out of pocket costs and execute any other documents or
other materials and provide such assistance as the Licensors request in

transfer the registration or application to the applicable Licensor or, at
a Licensors request, take all steps necessary to abandon, cancel or
withdraw, as requested, such registration or application.

other Person to, and they will ensure their Affiliates do not, nor authorize

identical or confusingly similar to any of the Licensed Property, "CBS" or the
Eye Design or any mark which combines the Licensed Property with any other
trademark, trade name or domain name or other designation, unless permitted
under another written agreement with Licensors to use a brand related to
Licensors licensed content (e.g., CBS SPORTS RADIO).

 

4.6 Nothing under this Agreement gives the Licensees any right to use the
Licensed Property in their corporate names or registered business names; but
Licensors acknowledges that the Licensees do use the Licensed Property in
unregistered "d/b/a" names that include Radio Indicators (e.g., WCBS(AM) does
business under the unregistered name "WCBS(AM)" or "WCBS Newsradio 880"),
which use shall not be considered a breach of this Agreement.

the applicable Term, subject to Section 3.5, Licensors shall be required to
maintain all registrations set forth in Schedule 1 for the Trademarks and all

(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively) by the Party entitled to enforce such term (each such entity, a
" _Waiving Entity_ "), but such waiver shall be effective only if it is in

this Agreement, no delay or omission on the part of any Party in exercising
any right or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any Party of any right or

continuation or repetition of the circumstances giving rise to such right

such waiver is asserted. The rights and remedies of the Parties hereunder are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would
otherwise have hereunder.

substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to either the Licensors or the
Licensees. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Licensors and the
Licensees shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Licensors and the Licensees as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

shall benefit Entercom, as set forth explicitly herein, and to the extent of

sole benefit of the Licensors and the Licensee and their permitted successors

12.9 _Waivers_. The observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively) by the Party entitled to enforce such term, (each such entity,
a " _Waiving Entity_ "), but such waiver shall be effective only if it is in
writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Waiving Entity against
which such waiver is to be asserted. Unless otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, no delay or omission on the part of any Party in exercising
any right or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any Party of any right or
privilege under this Agreement operate as a waiver of any other right or
privilege under this Agreement, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right or privilege preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or privilege under this Agreement. No failure by
either Party to take any action or assert any right or privilege hereunder
shall be deemed to be a waiver of such right or privilege in the event of the
continuation or repetition of the circumstances giving rise to such right
unless expressly waived in writing by the entity against whom the existence of
such waiver is asserted. The rights and remedies of the Parties hereunder are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would
otherwise have hereunder.

 

12.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or as a matter
of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to either the Licensor or the Licensees. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Licensor and the Licensees shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Licensor and the Licensees as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

12.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except to the extent that this
Agreement shall benefit Entercom, as set forth explicitly herein, and to the
extent of any indemnification of any Licensee Indemnified Parties and Licensor
Indemnified Parties, as set forth in Section 11, this Agreement is for the
sole benefit of the Licensor and the Licensees and their permitted successors
and assigns and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit
or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any
specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



23 12.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, and by each Party hereto in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or portable
document format (PDF) shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

 

12.13 _Rules of Construction_. Interpretation of this Agreement shall be
governed by the following rules of construction: (a) words in the singular
shall be held to include the plural and vice versa, and words of one gender
shall be held to include the other gender as the context requires; (b)

"written" or "in writing" include in electronic form; (g) provisions shall
apply, when appropriate, to successive events and transactions; (h) the
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement; if an
ambiguity or question of interpretation should arise, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the Licensor and the Licensees and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or burdening either Party
hereto by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions in this Agreement
or any interim drafts of this Agreement; (i) a reference to any Person
includes such Persons successors and permitted assigns; (j) any reference to
"days" means calendar days unless Business Days are expressly specified; and
(k) when calculating the period of time before which, within which or
following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded, and if the last day of such period is not a Business Day,
the period shall end on the next succeeding Business Day. Any action,
determination or approval of or required by the Licensor under this Agreement
shall be understood to be at the Licensors sole discretion unless expressly
stated otherwise hereunder.

 

12.14 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement is binding upon and is for the
benefit of the Parties and, as set forth in Section 12.7, their respective
permitted successors and permitted assigns.

12.15 _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) This Agreement is to be construed in accordance with and governed by
the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any
choice of law rule that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the internal laws of the State of Delaware to the
rights and duties of the parties.

 

(b) EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING

THEREOF. NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN ANY LAWSUIT,
PROCEEDING,

 



24  COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER LITIGATION PROCEDURE BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT
OF, THIS AGREEMENT. NO PARTY WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH
A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL
CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES THAT
IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS
SECTION. NO PARTY HAS IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER PARTY
THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION WILL NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL
INSTANCES.

Agreement, (a) CBS shall provide or cause to be provided to the Entercom
Group the services listed on _Schedule A_ to this Agreement (the " _CBS
Services_ ") and (b) Entercom shall provide or cause to be provided to the CBS
Group the services listed on _Schedule B_ to this Agreement (the " _Radio
Services_ ," and, collectively with the CBS Services, any Additional Services,
any Service Increases and any New Services, the " _Services_ "). All of the
CBS Services shall be for the sole use and benefit of the Radio Business and
all of the Radio Services shall be for the sole use and benefit of the CBS
Business.

 

Section 2.02. _Duration of Services_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement,
each of CBS and Entercom shall provide or cause to be provided to the
respective Recipients each Service until the earlier to occur of, with respect
to each such Service, (i) the expiration of the term for such Service (or,
subject to the terms of Section 7.01(d), the expiration of any
Service Extension) as set forth on _Schedule A_ or _Schedule B_ (each a "
_Schedule_ ," and, collectively, the " _Schedules_ ") or (ii) the date on
which such Service is terminated under _Section 7.01(b)_.

 

Section 2.03. _Additional Unspecified Services; Changes_.

 

(a) After the date of this Agreement, if (i) (x) Entercom identifies a digital
service that the CBS Group provided to the Radio Group prior to the
Separation that Entercom reasonably needs in order for the Radio Business to
continue to operate in substantially the same manner in which the Radio
Business operated prior to the Separation, and such digital service was
included on the initial draft of _Schedule A_ provided by CBS prior to the
execution of the Merger Agreement (the " _Initial Schedule A_ ") but
thereafter removed, or (y) CBS identifies a digital service that the Radio
Group provided to the CBS Group prior to the Separation that CBS reasonably
needs in order for the CBS Business to continue to operate in substantially
the same manner in which the CBS Business operated prior to the Separation,
and such digital service was initially included on the initial draft of
_Schedule B_ provided by CBS prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement
(the " _Initial Schedule B_ ") but thereafter removed, and (ii) the requesting
Party provides written notice to the other Party within 120 days following
the date of this Agreement requesting such additional services, then such
other Party shall provide such requested additional services (such requested
additional services, the " _Additional Services_ "). In connection with any
request for Additional Services in accordance with this _Section 2.03(a)_ ,
the

 



-4-  CBS Services Manager and the Radio Services Manager shall in good faith
negotiate the terms of a supplement to the applicable Schedule, which terms
shall be consistent with the terms of, and the pricing methodology used for,
similar Services provided under this Agreement. Upon the mutual written
agreement of the Parties, the supplement to the applicable Schedule shall
describe in reasonable detail the nature, scope, service
period(s), termination provisions and other terms applicable to such
Additional Services in a manner similar to that in which the Services are
described in the existing Schedules. Each supplement to the applicable
Schedule, as agreed to in writing by the Parties, shall be deemed part of
this Agreement as of the date of such agreement, and the Additional Services
set forth therein shall be deemed "Services" provided under this Agreement, in
each case subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

(b) After the date of this Agreement, if (i) a Recipient requests to increase,
relative to historical levels prior to the Separation, the volume, amount,
level or frequency, as applicable, of any Service provided by the Provider of
such Service and (ii) such increase is reasonably determined by such Recipient
as necessary for the Recipient to operate its businesses (such increases, the
" _Service Increases_ "), then such Provider shall consider such request in
good faith; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be obligated to
provide any Service Increase, including because, after good-faith
negotiations between the Parties, the Parties fail to reach an agreement with
respect to the terms thereof (including with respect to Service Charges
therefor) or if and to the extent such Service Increase would require
a material increase in the resources dedicated by Provider to the Services.
In connection with any request for Service Increases in accordance with this
_Section 2.03(b)_ , the CBS Services Manager and the Radio Services Manager
shall in good faith negotiate the terms of an amendment to the applicable
Schedule, which amendment shall be consistent with the terms of, and the
pricing methodology used for, the applicable Service. Each amended Schedule,
as agreed to in writing by the Parties, shall be deemed part of this
Agreement as of the date of such agreement, and the Service Increases set
forth therein shall be deemed a part of the "Services" provided under this
Agreement, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

(c) The Parties may, in accordance with the procedures specified in this
_Section 2.03(c)_ , agree to modify the terms and conditions relating to the
performance of or payment for a previously agreed-upon Service in order to
reflect, among other things, new procedures, processes or other methods of
providing such Service (a " _Service Modification_ ").

(i) _Change Requests_. In the event either of the Parties desires a Service
Modification, the Party requesting the Service Modification will deliver a
written description of the proposed Service Modification (a " _Change Request_
") to the other Partys Services Manager. Unless the Party receiving the
Change Request agrees to implement the Change Request as proposed, the
Services Managers will meet in person or by telephone to discuss in good faith
the Change Request no later than ten (10) Business Days after delivery of the
Change Request to the other Party.

(ii) _Approval of Recipient Change Requests_. All Change Requests from a
Recipient must be consented to by the applicable Providers Services Manager
in writing before the Service Modification may be implemented. Such consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For the purposes of
the preceding sentence, the Parties agree that it is not unreasonable to: (i)
withhold such consent to the

 



-5-  extent that such proposed Service Modification would materially increase the
resources provided by Provider after giving effect to the Change Request, or
(ii) condition such consent on Recipient agreeing to bear any reasonable and
documented increase in Providers cost of performance.

(iii)  _Approval of Provider Change Requests_. All Change Requests from a
Provider must be consented to by the applicable Recipients Service Manager in
writing before the Service Modifications may be implemented. Such consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For the purposes of the
preceding sentence, the Parties agree that it is not unreasonable to: (i)
withhold such consent to the extent that such proposed Service Modification
would materially decrease the resources provided by Provider or otherwise
materially adversely affect Providers performance of the Services after
giving effect to the Change Request, or (ii) condition such consent on
Provider agreeing to bear any cost increases.

(iv) _Implementation of Approved Change._ If a Change Request is approved in
accordance with this Section, the corresponding Schedule and the definition
of Services will be deemed amended as agreed by the Parties to reflect the
implementation of the Change Request as well as any conditions or other terms
agreed upon by the Parties in writing.

 

Section 2.04. _New Services_. (a) From time to time during the term of this
Agreement, either Party may request the other Party to provide additional or
different digital services which such other Party is not expressly obligated
to provide under this Agreement (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Additional Services or Service Increases, the " _New Services_ "). The Party
receiving such request shall consider such request in good faith; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Party shall be obligated to provide any New Services,
including because, (i) after good faith negotiations between the Parties
pursuant to _Section 2.04(b)_ , the Parties fail to reach an agreement with
respect to the terms (including the Service Charges) applicable to the
provision of such New Services or (ii) it does not, in its
reasonable judgment, have adequate resources to provide such New Service or
if the provision of such New Service would significantly disrupt the operation
of its businesses.

 

(b) In connection with any request for New Services in accordance with
_Section 2.04(a)_ , the CBS Services Manager and the Radio Services Manager
shall in good faith (i) negotiate the applicable Service Charge and the terms
of a supplement to the applicable Schedule, which supplement shall describe in
reasonable detail the nature, scope, service period(s), termination
provisions and other terms applicable to such New Services and (ii) determine
any costs and expenses, including any start-up costs and expenses, that would
be incurred by the Provider in connection with the provision of such New
Services, which costs and expenses shall be borne solely by the Recipient.
Each supplement to the applicable Schedule, as agreed to in writing by the
Parties, shall be deemed part of this Agreement as of the date of
such agreement, and the New Services set forth therein shall be deemed
"Services" provided under this Agreement, in each case subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.05. _Services Not Included_. Except as expressly set forth on a
Schedule, it is not the intent of the Provider to render, nor of the
Recipient to receive from the Provider,

 



-6-  professional advice or opinions, whether with regard to Tax, legal,

technical advice, whether with regard to information technology or other
matters, or the handling of or addressing environmental matters; the Recipient
shall not rely on, or construe, any Service rendered by or on behalf of the
Provider as such professional advice or opinions or technical advice; and the
Recipient shall seek all third-party professional advice or opinions or
technical advice as it may desire or need.

Section 2.06.  _Digital Services Managers_. (a) CBS hereby appoints and

Services (including the provision of and payment for the Services provided

to the Recipient of such Service such appropriately qualified personnel as
may be necessary to provide such Service on the understanding that such
personnel shall remain employed and/or engaged by the Provider. The Provider
will have the right, in its reasonable discretion, to (i) designate which
personnel it will assign to perform such Service and (ii) remove and replace
such personnel at any time; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such removal or
replacement shall not be the basis for any increase in any Service Charge or

the Provider will use its commercially reasonable efforts to limit the
disruption to the Recipient in the transition of the Services to different

ADDITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS

 

Section 3.01. _Software and Software Licenses_. (a) If and to the extent
requested by Entercom, CBS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to

rights) to use, duplicate and distribute, as necessary and applicable, certain
computer software necessary for CBS to provide, and the Radio Business
to receive, CBS Services; _provided_ that CBS shall not be required to pay
any fees or other payments or incur any obligations or liabilities to enable
Entercom to obtain any such license or rights (except and to the extent that
Entercom advances such fees or payments to CBS); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that CBS shall not be required to seek broader rights or more favorable terms
for Entercom than those applicable to CBS or Radio, as the case may be, prior

and, _provided_ , _further_ , that Radio shall bear only those costs that
relate solely and directly to obtaining such licenses (or other appropriate
rights) in the ordinary course. The Parties acknowledge and agree that there
can be no assurance that CBSs efforts will be successful or that Entercom
will be able to obtain such licenses or rights on acceptable terms or at all,
and, where CBS enjoys rights under any enterprise or site license or similar
license, the Parties acknowledge that such license typically precludes partial
transfers or assignments or operation of a service bureau on behalf of
unaffiliated entities. In the event that Entercom is unable to obtain such
software licenses, the Parties shall work together using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain an alternative software license to allow CBS to
provide, and the Radio Business to receive, such CBS Services, and the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith an amendment to the applicable Schedule to
reflect any such new arrangement.

(b) If and to the extent requested by CBS, Entercom shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist CBS in its efforts to obtain licenses (or other
appropriate rights) to use, duplicate and distribute, as necessary and
applicable, certain computer software necessary for Entercom to provide, and
CBS to receive, Radio Services; _provided_ that Radio shall not be required to
pay any fees or other payments or incur any obligations or liabilities to
enable CBS to obtain any such license or rights (except and to the extent
that CBS advances such fees or payments to Radio); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that Entercom shall not be required to seek broader rights or more favorable
terms for CBS than those applicable to Radio or CBS, as the case may be, prior
to the date of this Agreement or as may be applicable to Entercom from time
to time hereafter; and, provided, further, that CBS shall bear only those
costs that relate solely and directly to obtaining such licenses (or other
appropriate rights) in the ordinary course. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that there can be no assurance that Entercoms efforts will be successful or
that CBS will be able to obtain such licenses or rights on acceptable terms or
at all, and, where Entercom enjoys rights under any enterprise or site
license or similar license, the Parties acknowledge that such license
typically precludes partial transfers or assignments or operation of a service
bureau on behalf of unaffiliated entities. In the event that CBS is unable to
obtain such software licenses, the Parties shall work together using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an alternative software license to
allow Entercom to provide, and CBS to receive, such Radio Services, and the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith an amendment to the applicable Schedule
to reflect any such new arrangement.

 



-9- (c) In the event that there are any costs associated with obtaining software
licenses in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.01_ that (i) would not be
payable in the ordinary course, including in the form of a "transfer fee" or
other similar fees or expenses payable by the Recipient or the Provider
and (ii) would not have been payable by the Recipient or the Provider absent
the need for a consent or waiver in connection with the license that the
Recipient is seeking to obtain, such costs shall be borne by the Recipient.

other members of the Entercom Group to, allow CBS and its Representatives
reasonable access to the facilities of the Entercom Group necessary for CBS to
fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

other Party, its Subsidiaries and Representatives, following not less than
five (5) business days prior written notice from the other Party, reasonable
access during normal business hours to the facilities, information, systems,
infrastructure and personnel of the relevant Providers as reasonably necessary
for the other Party to verify the adequacy of internal controls over
information technology, reporting of financial data and related processes
employed in connection with the Services, including in connection with
verifying compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
_provided_ , _however_ , such access shall not unreasonably interfere with
any of the business or operations of such Party or its Subsidiaries.

(d) Except as otherwise permitted by the other Party in writing, each Party
shall permit only its authorized Representatives, contractors, invitees or
licensees to access the other Partys facilities.

 

(e) Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties, each Party will: (i)
use the facilities of the other Party solely for the purpose of providing or
receiving the Services, as applicable, and not to provide goods or services to
or for the benefit of any third party or for any unlawful purpose; (ii) comply
with all reasonable policies and procedures governing access to and use of
the other Partys facilities made known to the accessing Party in advance,

Party in the same condition it was in prior to the accessing Partys use of

Parties to implement this Agreement and to ensure performance of this
Agreement by the Parties at the agreed-upon levels in accordance with all of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The

 



-10-  Parties will cooperate, acting in good faith and using commercially
reasonable efforts, to effect a smooth and orderly transition of the Services
provided under this Agreement from the Provider to the Recipient (including
repairs and maintenance Services and the assignment or transfer of the rights
and obligations under any third-party contracts relating to the Services);
_provided_ , _however_ , that this  _Section_ __ _ 3.03_ shall not require
either Party to incur any out-of-pocket costs or expenses unless reimbursed by
the other Party.

 

(b) Recipient shall be responsible for planning and preparing for the
transition to its own internal organization or other third-party
service providers the provision of all of the Services in a timely manner,
such transition to be completed by the end of the Term (the " _Cutover_ "). At
Recipients request, Provider shall meet with Recipient upon reasonable notice
and at a mutually agreeable time, following such request to assist Recipient
with the initial development of a plan for Cutover (the " _Cutover Plan_ ")
and shall, in good faith, provide Recipient with all information in the
possession of Provider related to the Services reasonably requested by the
Recipient that is necessary for the development and implementation of the
Cutover Plan. Recipient shall prepare a Cutover Plan with sufficient lead time
in order to achieve a timely Cutover. Once the Cutover Plan is prepared,

other applicable agreement.

(a) The Provider shall only process personal data which it may receive from
the Recipient, while carrying out its duties under this Agreement, (i) in
such a manner as is necessary to carry out those duties, (ii) in accordance
with the instructions of the Recipient, (iii) using appropriate technical and
organizational measures to prevent the unauthorized or unlawful processing of
such personal data and/or the accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to,
such personal data and (iv) in compliance with all applicable Laws.

 

(b) The Provider will maintain and enforce physical, technical and logical
security procedures with respect to the access and maintenance of any
Confidential Information of the Recipient that is in the Providers possession
in performing the Services, which procedures shall: (i) be in full compliance
with applicable Law and (ii) conform with the Providers information security
policies. With respect to any Provider systems that are used to store or
process data or other information of Recipient, Provider shall maintain and
implement the same backup, redundancy, and disaster avoidance and recovery
policies and procedures as Provider does with respect to the systems it uses
to store or process its own data and information. In the event there is a
material security breach which could reasonably be expected to have resulted
in unauthorized access to, or alteration, destruction or corruption of, any
data or information of Recipient, Provider will notify Recipient of such
breach immediately. The Provider will use diligent efforts to remedy such
breach of security or unauthorized access in a timely manner.

COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS

 

Section 4.01. _Costs and Disbursements_. (a) Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, a Recipient of Services shall pay to the Provider of such
Services a monthly fee for the Services (or category of Services, as
applicable) (each fee constituting a " _Service Charge_ " and, collectively, "
_Service Charges_ ") as listed on the Schedules hereto.

(b) During the term of this Agreement, the amount of a Service Charge for any
Services (or category of Services, as applicable) may increase to the extent
of: (i) any increases mutually agreed to by the Parties, (ii) any Service
Charges applicable to any Additional Services, Service Increases or New
Services and (iii) any increase in the rates or charges imposed by any
unaffiliated third-party provider that is providing Services, provided that,
Provider shall provide Recipient with as much advance notice as is reasonably
possible of any such increases imposed by a third-party provider. Together
with any monthly invoice for Service Charges and Reimbursement Charges, the
Provider shall provide the Recipient with documentation to support the
calculation of such Service Charges or any Reimbursement Charges.

 

(c) The Recipient shall reimburse the Provider for reasonable unaffiliated
third-party out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Provider or its
Affiliates in connection with providing the Services (including necessary
travel-related expenses) (each such cost or expense, a " _Reimbursement
Charge_ " and, collectively, " _Reimbursement Charges_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such cost or expense that is materially inconsistent with
historical practice between the Parties for any Service (including business
travel and related expenses) shall require advance approval of the Recipient.
Any authorized travel-related expenses incurred in performing the Services
shall be incurred and charged to the Recipient in accordance with the
Providers then-applicable business travel policies made known to the
Recipient.

(d) The Service Charges and Reimbursement Charges due and payable hereunder
shall be invoiced and paid in U.S. dollars. The Recipient shall pay the amount
of each monthly invoice by wire transfer (or such other method of payment as
may be agreed between the Parties) to the Provider within sixty (60) days of
the receipt of each such invoice, including appropriate documentation as
described herein. In the absence of a timely notice of billing dispute in
accordance with the provisions of Article VII of the Separation Agreement,
if the Recipient fails to pay such amount by the due date, the Recipient
shall be obligated to pay to the Provider, in addition to the amount due,
interest at an annual default interest rate of three percent (3%), or the
maximum legal rate, whichever is lower (the " _Interest Payment_ "), accruing
from the date the payment was due through the date of actual payment. In the
event of any billing dispute, the Recipient shall promptly pay any undisputed
amount.

 

(e) Subject to the confidentiality provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.03_, each Party shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
provide, upon ten (10) days prior written notice from the other Party, any
information within such Partys or its Affiliates possession that the
requesting Party reasonably requests in connection with any Services being
provided to such requesting Party by an unaffiliated third-party provider,
including any applicable invoices, agreements documenting the arrangements
between such third-party provider and the Provider and other
supporting documentation.

 



-12- (f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) following the date of
this Agreement, Entercom shall pay CBS the fees set forth in Note A to the
Initial Schedule A, in accordance with the terms of such Note A (including
with respect to the timing and amount of such fees), regardless of the level
and type of services provided hereunder and (ii) Schedule B shall be in
substantially similar form as set forth in the Initial Schedule B. This
Section 4.01(f) and Note A to the Initial Schedule A shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 4.02. _Tax Matters_. (a) Without limiting any provisions of this
Agreement, the Recipient shall be responsible for and shall promptly pay (i)
all excise, sales, use, transfer, stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and
other similar Taxes and (ii) any related interest and penalties, excluding in
each case any Taxes imposed on or measured by income (collectively, " _Non-
Income Taxes_"), in each case imposed or assessed as a result of the provision
of Services by the Provider. Upon the written request of the Provider, the
Recipient shall submit evidence of payment of such Non-Income Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority. The Provider agrees that it shall take
commercially reasonable actions to cooperate with the Recipient in
obtaining any refund, return, rebate or the like of any Non-Income Tax,
including by filing any necessary exemption or other similar forms,
certificates or other similar documents. The Recipient shall promptly
reimburse the Provider for any unaffiliated third-party out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Provider or its Affiliates in connection with the Recipient
obtaining a refund or overpayment of refund, return, rebate or the like of
any Non-Income Tax. For the avoidance of doubt, any applicable income-based
Taxes measured by or imposed on the income of the Provider that are imposed
or assessed as a result of the provision of Services by the Provider shall be
borne by the Provider, unless the Provider is required by law to obtain
reimbursement of such Taxes from the Recipient.

 

(b) The Recipient shall be entitled to deduct and withhold Taxes required by
any applicable law to be withheld on payments made pursuant to this
Agreement. To the extent any amounts are so withheld, the Recipient shall (i)
pay, in addition to the amount otherwise due to the Provider under this
Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net
amount actually received by the Provider will equal the full amount the
Provider would have received had no such deduction or withholding been
required, (ii) pay when due such deducted and withheld amount to the proper
Governmental Authority and (iii) promptly provide to the Provider evidence of
such payment to such Governmental Authority. The Provider shall, prior to the
date of any payment to be made pursuant to this Agreement, at the request of
the Recipient, make commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Recipient
any certificate or other documentary evidence (x) required by applicable law
or (y) which the Provider is entitled by applicable law to provide in order to
reduce the amount of any Taxes that may be deducted or withheld from such
payment, and the Recipient agrees to accept and act in reliance on any such
duly and properly executed certificate or other applicable documentary
evidence.

 

(c) If the Provider (i) receives any refund (whether by payment, offset,
credit or otherwise) or (ii) utilizes any overpayment of Taxes that are borne
by Recipient pursuant to this Agreement, then the Provider shall promptly pay,
or cause to be paid, to the Recipient an amount equal to the deficiency or
excess, as the case may be, with respect to the amount that the Recipient has
borne if the amount of such refund or overpayment (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any interest or other amounts received with respect to
such refund or overpayment) had been included originally in the determination
of the amounts to be borne by Recipient pursuant to this Agreement, net of
any additional Taxes the Provider incurs or will incur as a result of the
receipt of such refund or such overpayment.

 



-13- Section 4.03. _No Right to Set-Off_. Subject to Section 4.02(b), the
Recipient shall timely pay the full amount of Service Charges and
Reimbursement Charges and shall not set-off, counterclaim or otherwise
withhold any amount owed to the Provider under this Agreement on account of
any obligation owed by the Provider to the Recipient.

ARTICLE V

 

STANDARD FOR SERVICE

 

Section 5.01. _Standard for Service_.

 

(a) The Provider agrees to perform the Services in a good and workman-like
manner, in compliance with all applicable Laws, and with substantially the
same nature, quality, standard of care and service levels at which the same or
similar services were performed by or on behalf of the Provider during the
one-year period prior to the Separation or, if not so previously provided,
then substantially similar to that which are applicable to similar services
provided to the Providers Affiliates or other business components. Subject to
Section 7.03, the Provider agrees to respond to any outage, interruption or
other failure of which it is aware of a Service in a manner that is
substantially similar to the manner in which such Provider or its Affiliates
responded to any outage, interruption or other failure of the same or similar
services during the one-year period prior to the Separation.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Provider to perform or cause
to be performed any Service to the extent the manner of such performance would
constitute a violation of applicable Law or any existing contract or agreement
with a third party. If the Provider is or becomes aware of any potential
violation on the part of the Provider, the Provider shall promptly send a
written notice to the Recipient of any such potential violation. The Parties
each agree to cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
necessary third-party consents required under any existing contract or
agreement with a third party to allow the Provider to perform or cause to be
performed any Service in accordance with the standards set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.01_. Any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by either
Party in connection with obtaining any such third-party consent that is
required to allow the Provider to perform or cause to be performed any Service
shall be solely the responsibility of the Recipient. If, with respect to a
Service, the Parties, despite the use of such commercially reasonable efforts,
are unable to obtain a required third-party consent, or the performance of
such Service by the Provider would continue to constitute a violation of
applicable Laws, the Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts in
good faith to provide such Services in a manner as closely as possible to the
standards described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.01_ that would apply absent the
exception provided for in the first sentence of this _Section 5.01(b)_.

 

Section 5.02. _Disclaimer of Warranties_. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN
THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE SERVICES ARE
PROVIDED AS-IS, THAT EACH RECIPIENT ASSUMES ALL RISKS AND LIABILITY ARISING
FROM OR RELATING TO ITS USE OF AND RELIANCE UPON THE SERVICES, AND EACH
PROVIDER, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT 

 



-14-  PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH
RESPECT THERETO. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, TO THE
MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH PROVIDER HEREBY EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SERVICES, WHETHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, EITHER IN FACT OR BY OPERATION OF LAW, BY STATUTE OR
OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY IN REGARD TO
QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, NONINFRINGEMENT, COMMERCIAL UTILITY, MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS OF ANY SERVICE FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Section 5.03.  _Compliance with Laws and Regulations_. Each Party shall be
responsible for its own compliance and its subcontractors compliance with any
and all Laws applicable to its performance under this Agreement. No Party will
knowingly take any action in violation of any such applicable Law that
results in liability being imposed on the other Party.

ARTICLE VI

(including negligence and strict liability) or otherwise, at law or equity,
for any special, indirect, incidental, punitive or consequential damages
whatsoever (including lost profits or damages calculated on multiples of
earnings approaches), which in any way arise out of, relate to or are a
consequence of, its performance or nonperformance (or the performance or
nonperformance of any of its Affiliates, Representatives and any unaffiliated

this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence and strict
liability) or otherwise, at law or equity, shall not exceed the total
aggregate Service Charges (excluding any Reimbursement Charges) actually paid
to such Provider by the Recipient pursuant to this Agreement. The foregoing
limitations on liability in this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ shall not apply to any
breach of  _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ and shall not limit any obligation to re-
perform as set forth in Section 6.03. This _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ shall survive
any termination of this Agreement.

Section 6.03. _Obligation_ _To_ _ Re-perform; Liabilities_. In the event of

and exclusive remedy of the Recipient for any such breach of this Agreement.
Any request for re-performance in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_
by the Recipient must be in writing and specify in reasonable detail the
particular error, defect or breach, and such request must be made no more than
one (1) month from the date such error, defect or breach becomes apparent or
should have reasonably become apparent to the Recipient. This Section 6.03
shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

each Recipient hereby releases the applicable Provider and its Affiliates and
Representatives (each, a "Provider Indemnified Party"), and each Recipient
hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each such Provider
Indemnified Party from and against any and all liabilities arising from,
relating to or in connection with: (a) the use of any Services by such
Recipient or any of its Affiliates, Representatives or other Persons using
such Services; or (b) the sale, delivery, provision or use of any Services
provided under or contemplated by this Agreement, in the case of each of
clause (a) and (b), except to the extent that such liabilities arise out of,
relate to or are a consequence of the applicable Provider Indemnified Partys
(i) bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct or (ii) breach of this
Agreement.

 

Section 6.05. _Provider Indemnity_. Subject to Section 6.01, each Provider
hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the applicable Recipient
and its Affiliates and Representatives (each, a "Recipient Indemnified

in connection with: (a) the use of any Services by such Recipient or any of
its Affiliates, Representatives or other Persons using such Services; or (b)
the sale, delivery, provision or use of any Services provided under or

the extent that such liabilities arise out of, relate to or are a consequence
of the applicable Providers (i) bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct or (ii) breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.06. _Intellectual Property Indemnification_.

 

(a) Entercom agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless CBS and its
Affiliates and Representatives (each a " _CBS Party_ "), from and against any
and all Losses, as incurred, arising out of, relating to or in connection with
Content furnished by a Radio Party (" _Radio Content_ ") with respect to any
third party claims that the Radio Content infringes the Intellectual Property
Rights of any such third party or constitutes libel or defamation, except to
the extent any such Loss arises as a result of any change to the Radio Content
made by a CBS Party.

 

(b) CBS agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Entercom and its
Affiliates and Representatives (each a " _Radio Party_ ") from and against
any and all Losses, as incurred, arising out of, relating to or in connection
with Content furnished by a CBS Party (" _CBS_ _Content_ ") with respect to
any third party claims that the CBS Content infringes the Intellectual
Property Rights of any such third party or constitutes libel or defamation,
except to the extent any such Loss arises as a result of any change to the CBS

-16- Section 6.07. _Indemnification Procedures_. The provisions of Article VI of
the Separation Agreement shall govern claims for indemnification under this
Agreement.

Section 6.08. _Liability for Payment Obligations_. Nothing in this _Article

ARTICLE VII

 

TERM AND TERMINATION

 

Section 7.01. _Term and Termination_. (a) This Agreement shall commence
immediately after the Effective Time and shall terminate upon the earlier to
occur of: (i) the last date on which either Party is obligated to provide any
Service to the other Party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or
(ii) the mutual written agreement of the Parties to terminate this Agreement
in its entirety.

(b) Either Party may terminate this Agreement in its entirety, or from time to
time with respect to the entirety of any individual Service, in its sole
discretion, in the event of any Change of Control of the other Party, upon
providing at least twenty (20) days prior written notice.

 

(c) Without prejudice to a Recipients rights with respect to a Force Majeure,
a Recipient may from time to time terminate this Agreement with respect to
the entirety of any individual Service but not a portion thereof:

(i) for any reason or no reason, upon providing at least sixty (60) days
prior written notice to the Provider; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Recipient shall pay to the Provider the necessary and reasonable documented
out-of-pocket costs incurred by Provider solely as a result of the early
termination of such Service other than any employee severance and relocation
expenses, but including sunken costs for the provision of the applicable
Service which cannot be recovered, non-terminable contractual obligations
under agreements used to provide such Service, any breakage or termination
fees and any other termination costs payable by the Provider with respect to
any resources or pursuant to any other third-party agreements that were used
by the Provider to provide such Service (or an equitably allocated portion
thereof, in the case of any such equipment, resources or agreements that also
were used for purposes other than providing Services); _provided_ , _further_
, that Provider shall notify Recipient of all such costs prior to termination,
and Recipient is given the option of rescinding the termination notice for a
period of two (2) days following receipt of notice of such costs; or

(ii) if the Provider of such Service has failed to perform any of its
material obligations under this Agreement with respect to such Service, and
such failure shall continue to exist twenty (20) days after receipt by the
Provider of written notice of such failure from the Recipient.

 



-17- In the event that any Service is terminated other than at the end of a month,
the Service Charge associated with such Service shall be pro-rated
appropriately. The Parties acknowledge that there may be interdependencies
among the Services being provided under this Agreement that may not be
identified on the applicable Schedules and agree that, if the Providers
ability to provide a particular Service in accordance with this Agreement is
materially and adversely affected by the termination of another Service in
accordance with Section 7.01(c)(i) , then the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to amend the Schedule relating to such affected continuing Service,
which amendment shall be consistent with the terms of, and the pricing
methodology used for, comparable Services.

 

(d) In connection with the termination of any Service, if the Recipient
reasonably determines that it will require such Service to continue beyond
the date on which such Service is scheduled to terminate, the Recipient may
extend such Service (any such extension, a " _Service Extension_ ") for a
specified period beyond the scheduled termination of such Service (which
period (i) shall in no event be longer than one (1) year and (ii) shall in no
event terminate later than two (2) years after the date of the Final
Distribution) by written notice to the Provider no less than thirty (30) days
prior to the date of such scheduled termination on the same terms and
conditions as such Service was provided prior to the Service Extension,
provided that the Parties agree to negotiate any changes to such terms or
conditions in good faith if so requested by a Party; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that (i) there shall be no more than one (1) Service Extension with respect to
each Service and (ii) the Provider shall not be obligated to provide such
Service Extension if a third-party consent is required and cannot be obtained
by the Provider. In connection with any request for Service Extensions in
accordance with this Section 7.01(d), the CBS Services Manager and the Radio
Services Manager shall in good faith (x) negotiate the terms of an amendment
to the applicable Schedule, which amendment shall be consistent with the terms
of the applicable Service, and (y) determine the costs and expenses (other
than Service Charges), if any, that would be incurred by the Provider or the
Recipient, as the case may be, in connection with the provision of such
Service Extension, which costs and expenses shall be borne solely by the Party
requesting the Service Extension. Each amended Schedule to implement a
Service Extension, as agreed to in writing by the Parties, shall be deemed
part of this Agreement as of the date of such agreement and any Services
provided pursuant to such Service Extensions shall be deemed
"Services" provided under this Agreement, in each case subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

Section 7.02. _Effect of Termination_. Upon termination of any Service
pursuant to this Agreement, the Provider of the terminated Service will have
no further obligation to provide the terminated Service, and the relevant
Recipient will have no obligation to pay any future Service Charges relating
to any such Service; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Recipient shall remain
obligated to the relevant Provider for the (i) Service Charges and
Reimbursement Charges owed 

 



-18-  and payable in respect of Services provided prior to the effective date of
termination and (ii) any applicable charges described in Section 7.01(c)(i),
which charges shall be payable only in the event that the Recipient
terminates any Service pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(i). In connection with the
termination of any Service, the provisions of this Agreement not relating
solely to such terminated Service shall survive any such termination, and in
connection with a termination of this Agreement, _Article I_ , _Article VI_
(including liability in respect of any indemnifiable liabilities under this
Agreement arising or occurring on or prior to the date of termination),
_Article VII_ , _Article VIII_ and all confidentiality obligations under this
Agreement and liability for all due and unpaid Service Charges and
Reimbursement Charges and any applicable charges payable pursuant to
Section 7.01(c)(i), shall continue to survive indefinitely. For the avoidance
of doubt, termination of any Service pursuant to this Agreement will not
affect the rights and obligations of the Parties with respect to any Common
Agreements under the Separation Agreement.

Section 7.03. _Force Majeure_. (a) Neither Party (nor any Person acting on its
behalf) shall have any liability or responsibility for failure to fulfill any
obligation (other than a payment obligation) under this Agreement so long as
and to the extent to which the fulfillment of such obligation is prevented,
frustrated, hindered or delayed as a consequence of a Force Majeure;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) such Party (or such Person) shall have
exercised commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the effect of such Force
Majeure on its obligations and, to the extent and as soon as possible and
commercially reasonable, to remove such Force Majeure; and (ii) the nature,
quality and standard of care that the Provider shall provide in delivering a
Service after a Force Majeure shall be substantially the same as the nature,
quality and standard of care that the Provider provides to its Affiliates with
respect to such Service. In the event of an occurrence of a Force Majeure, the
Party whose performance is affected thereby shall give notice of suspension as
soon as reasonably practicable to the other stating the date and extent of
such suspension and the cause thereof, and such Party shall resume the
performance of such obligations as soon as reasonably practicable after the
removal of such cause.

 

(b) During the period of a Force Majeure, the Recipient shall be entitled to
permanently terminate such Service(s) (and shall be relieved of the
obligation to pay Service Charges for such Services(s) throughout the duration
of such Force Majeure) if a Force Majeure shall continue to exist for more
than fifteen (15) consecutive days, it being understood that Recipient shall
not be required to provide any advance notice of such termination to Provider
or pay any charges in connection therewith.

ARTICLE VIII 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

Section 8.01. _No Agency_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed in any
way or for any purpose to constitute any Party as an agent of an unaffiliated
party in the conduct of such other partys business. A Provider of any Service
under this Agreement shall act as an independent contractor and not as the
agent of the Recipient in performing such Service, maintaining control over
its employees, its subcontractors and their employees and complying with all
withholding of income at source requirements, whether federal, national,
state, local or foreign.

 



-19- Section 8.02. _Subcontractors_. A Provider may hire or engage one or
more subcontractors to perform any or all of its obligations under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) such Provider shall use the same
degree of care in selecting any such subcontractor as it would if such
contractor was being retained to provide similar services to the Provider and
(ii) such Provider shall in all cases remain primarily responsible for all of
its obligations under this Agreement with respect to the scope of the
Services, the standard for services as set forth in _Article V_ and the
content of the Services provided to the Recipient.

Section 8.03. _Treatment of Confidential Information_.

(a) The Parties shall not, and shall cause all other Persons providing
Services or having access to information of the other Party that is
confidential or proprietary (" _Confidential Information_ ") not to, disclose
to any other Person or use, except for purposes of this Agreement, any
Confidential Information of the other Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the Confidential Information may be used by such Party to the extent that such
Confidential Information has been (i) in the public domain through no fault of
such Party or any member of such Group or any of their
respective Representatives, (ii) later lawfully acquired from other sources
by such Party (or any member of such Partys Group) which sources are not
themselves bound by a confidentiality obligation, or (iii) independently
generated without reference to any Confidential Information of the other
Party; _provided_ , _further_ , that each Party may disclose Confidential
Information of the other Party, to the extent not prohibited by applicable
Law: (i) to its Representatives on a need-to-know basis in connection with
the performance of such Partys obligations under this Agreement; (ii) in any
report, statement, testimony or other submission required to be made to any
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the disclosing Party; or (iii)
in order to comply with applicable Law, or in response to any summons,
subpoena or other legal process or formal or informal investigative demand
issued to the disclosing Party in the course of any litigation, investigation
or administrative proceeding. In the event that a Party becomes legally
compelled (based on advice of counsel) by deposition, interrogatory,
request for documents subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar
judicial or administrative process to disclose any Confidential Information of
the other Party, such disclosing Party shall provide the other Party with
prompt prior written notice of such requirement, and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, cooperate with the other Party (at such other Partys
expense) to obtain a protective order or similar remedy to cause such
Confidential Information not to be disclosed, including interposing all
available objections thereto, such as objections based on settlement
privilege. In the event that such protective order or other similar remedy is
not obtained, the disclosing Party shall furnish only that portion of the
Confidential Information that has been legally compelled, and shall exercise
its commercially reasonable efforts (at such other Partys expense) to obtain
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential
Information.

 

(b) Each Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, protect the
Confidential Information of the other Party by using the same degree of care
to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of such as the Party uses to protect
its own confidential information of a like nature, but in any event no less
than a reasonable degree of care.

 

(c) Each Party shall be liable for any failure by its respective
Representatives to comply with the restrictions on use and disclosure
of Confidential Information contained in this Agreement.

 



-20- (d) Each Party shall comply with all applicable local, state, national,
federal and foreign privacy and data protection Laws that are or that may in
the future be applicable to the provision of Services under this Agreement.

 

Section 8.04. _Further Assurances_. Each Party covenants and agrees that,
without any additional consideration, it shall execute and deliver any
further legal instruments and perform any acts that are or may become
necessary to effectuate this Agreement.

 

Section 8.05. _Dispute Resolution_. Any Dispute shall be resolved in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Article VII_  of the Separation
Agreement, which shall be the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution
of any such Dispute unless otherwise specified herein or in _Article VII_ of
the Separation Agreement.

 

Section 8.06. _Notices_. Except with respect to routine communications by the
CBS Services Manager, Radio Services Manager, CBS Local Services Manager and
Radio Local Service Manager under _Section_ __ _ 2.06_, all notices,
requests, claims, demands and other communications under this Agreement shall
be in writing and shall be given or made (and shall be deemed to have been

without reference to any conflict of Law rules that might lead to the

form reasonably agreed upon) for any liability or obligation of the assignee
under this Agreement;

(b) in connection with the divestiture of any Subsidiary or business of such
Party that is a Recipient to an acquirer that is not a competitor of the

respect to an acquirer that is a competitor, and (iv) no Party shall be
obligated to provide any such assigned Services to an acquirer that is a
competitor if the provision of such assigned Services to such acquirer
would disrupt the operation of such Partys businesses or create a
competitive disadvantage for such Party with respect to such acquirer.

Parties shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the

required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Acquiror Group, the
Radio Group or any Radio Indemnified Party for any Other Taxes pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_ (a) to the extent such Other Taxes were taken into
account as liabilities in the determination of Radio Working Capital pursuant
to the Merger Agreement and (b) until the aggregate amount of such Other
Taxes indemnified pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_ exceeds $25,000, in
which event CBS shall be required to indemnify the Acquiror Group, the Radio
Group or any Radio Indemnified Party for all such Other Taxes from the first
dollar thereof.

 



12 Section 2.08 _No_ _Liability_ _for_ _Prior_ _Payments_. For the avoidance of
doubt, no Party shall have any responsibility with respect to, or have any
obligation to repay, any payment made by another Party or any of its
Affiliates prior to the date of this Agreement (whether made to such first
Party, to any Tax Authority or to any other Person) in respect of any Taxes
or other amounts for which such first Party is responsible hereunder.

positions taken on such Tax Return would reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect the Tax position of any member of the Acquiror Group or
(following the Effective Time) Radio Group, CBS shall submit a draft of the
portion of such Tax Return that relates solely to the Radio Business to
Acquiror at least 30 days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax
Return (taking into account any applicable extensions), and Acquiror shall
have the right to review such portion of such Tax Return and to submit any
reasonable changes to such portion of such Tax Return no later than 15 days
prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that nothing herein shall prevent CBS from timely filing any such
Tax Return. The Parties agree to consult and to attempt to resolve in good
faith any issues arising as a result of the review of any such Tax Return. Any
disputes that the Parties are unable to resolve shall be resolved pursuant to
_Article_ __ _ 13_ hereof. In the event that any dispute is not resolved
(whether pursuant to good faith negotiations among the Parties or pursuant
to  _Article_ __ _ 13_ hereof) prior to the due date for the filing of such
Tax Return (taking into account any applicable extensions), such Tax Return
shall be timely filed by CBS and the Parties agree to amend such Tax Return
as necessary to reflect the resolution of such dispute in a manner consistent
with such resolution.

(a) Acquiror and Radio shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared

pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01_. Acquiror and Radio shall pay all
Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Return to the relevant Tax Authority.

 



13 (b) With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed by Acquiror or Radio
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.02_, to the extent that such Tax Return
relates to a Pre-Distribution Period, Acquiror and Radio shall submit a draft
of such Tax Return to CBS at least 30 days prior to the due date for the
filing of such Tax Return (taking into account any applicable extensions), and
CBS shall have the right to review such Tax Return and to submit any
reasonable changes to such Tax Return no later than 15 days prior to the due
date for the filing of such Tax Return; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein shall prevent Acquiror or Radio from timely filing (or causing to be
timely filed) any such Tax Return. The Parties agree to consult and to attempt
to resolve in good faith any issues arising as a result of the review of any
such Tax Return. Any disputes that the Parties are unable to resolve shall be
resolved pursuant to _Article_ __ _ 13_ hereof. In the event that any dispute
is not resolved (whether pursuant to good faith negotiations among the
Parties or pursuant to _Article_ __ _ 13_ hereof) prior to the due date for
the filing of such Tax Return (taking into account any applicable extensions),
such Tax Return shall be timely filed (or caused to be timely filed) by

resolution.

 

Section 3.03 _Tax_ _Reporting_ _Practices_.

 

(a) _CBS_ _General_ _Rule_. Except to the extent otherwise provided in
_Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_, CBS shall report any item on any Tax Return that it
is required to prepare and file or to cause to be prepared and filed pursuant
to this Agreement in accordance with the past practices, accounting methods,
elections or conventions ("Past Practice") previously used by CBS with
respect to the item in question (unless otherwise required by applicable Law),
and to the extent that there is no Past Practice with respect to such item, in
accordance with reasonable Tax accounting practices selected by CBS.

(b) _Radio_ _General_ _Rule_. Except to the extent otherwise provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_, Acquiror and Radio shall report any item on any Tax
Return that it is required to prepare and file or cause to be prepared and
filed pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with Past Practice
previously used by CBS or the appropriate Radio Entity, as appropriate, with
respect to the item in question (unless otherwise required by applicable Law),
and to the extent that there is no Past Practice, in accordance with
reasonable Tax accounting practices selected by Acquiror and Radio.

(c) _Reporting_ _of_ _Transactions_. The Tax treatment of the Distributions
and the Merger reported on any Tax Return shall be consistent with the
treatment thereof in the Tax Opinions (to the extent still valid and in
effect), taking into account the jurisdiction in which such Tax Returns are
filed, _provided_ , _however_ , that if no Tax Opinion specifies the Tax
treatment of any of the Distributions or the Merger in a particular Tax
jurisdiction, the Tax treatment of such Distribution or Merger, as applicable,
for such jurisdiction shall be as determined by the Party liable for any Tax
with respect to such Distribution or Merger, after consulting in good faith
with the other Parties.

Section 3.04  _Consolidated_ _or_ _Combined_ _Tax_ _Returns_. Acquiror and
Radio shall take all actions and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
take all actions as CBS may determine, after consulting with Acquiror in good
faith, are required or appropriate, or otherwise requested by CBS in
connection with the filing of any Joint Returns.

 



14 Section 3.05 _Straddle_ _Period_ _Tax_ _Allocation_. CBS, Acquiror and Radio
shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to close the taxable year of
Radio and each Radio Entity for all Tax purposes as of the close of the
Distribution Date to the extent required by applicable Law. With respect to
Taxes for any Straddle Period, (i) if applicable Law does not require Radio
or a Radio Entity, as the case may be, to close its taxable year on the
Distribution Date, then the allocation of income or deductions required to
determine any Taxes or other amounts attributable to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on, or beginning after, the Distribution Date shall be
made by means of a closing of the books and records of Radio or such Radio
Entity as of the close of the Distribution Date;  _provided_ , that
exemptions, allowance or deductions that are calculated on an annual or
periodic basis shall be allocated between such portions in proportion to the
number of days in each such portion, and (ii) property Taxes or other non-
Income Taxes that are calculated on an annual or periodic basis and not
assessed with respect to a transaction or series of transactions shall be
allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Distribution
Date and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Distribution
Date in proportion to the number of days in each such portion.

 

Section 3.06 _Radio_ _Carrybacks_ _and_ _Claims_ _for_ _Refunds_.

 

(a) _General._ Unless CBS otherwise consents in writing or as required by Law,
neither Acquiror nor Radio shall (i) file any Adjustment Request with respect
to any Joint Return, (ii) fail to waive any available elections to carry back
to any Joint Return any Radio Carryback arising in a Post-Distribution Period,
and (iii) make any affirmative election to claim any such Radio Carryback
with respect to any Joint Return.

(b) _Extraordinary_ _Transactions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, except as required by Law, for all Tax purposes, the
Parties shall report any Extraordinary Transactions that are caused or
permitted by Radio or any Radio Entity on the Distribution Date after the
Effective Time as occurring on the day after the Distribution Date pursuant
to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or any similar or
analogous provision of state, local or foreign Law, unless such allocation is
not "reasonable" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).

 

(c) In the event that Acquiror and Radio (or the appropriate member of the
Radio Group) are prohibited by applicable Law from waiving or otherwise
forgoing a Radio Carryback or CBS consents to a Radio Carryback, CBS shall
cooperate with Acquiror and Radio, at Acquirors and Radios expense, in
seeking from the appropriate Tax Authority such Tax Benefit (which, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, CBS shall elect to receive in the form of
a cash refund rather than as a credit toward or reduction in future Taxes) as
reasonably would result from such Radio Carryback, to the extent that such Tax
Benefit is directly attributable to such Radio Carryback. To the extent such
Tax Benefit is received in the form of a Refund in cash, CBS shall pay over to
Acquiror or Radio the amount of such Refund within 10 days after such Refund
is received and, to the extent that a Tax Authority requires CBS to apply or
cause to be applied the Tax Benefit as a credit toward or a reduction in Taxes
in lieu of a cash Refund, within 10 days after a Refund with respect to such
Tax Benefit is actually realized; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Acquiror and
Radio shall indemnify and hold the members of the CBS Group harmless from and
against any and all collateral Tax consequences resulting from or caused by
any such Radio Carryback, including, without limitation, the loss or
postponement of any benefit

 



15  from the use of Tax Attributes generated by a member of the CBS Group if (i)
such Tax Attributes expire unused, but would have been utilized but for such
Radio Carryback, or (ii) the use of such Tax Attributes is postponed to a
later Tax Period than the Tax Period in which such Tax Attributes would have
been used but for such Radio Carryback.

 

(d) Unless Acquiror otherwise consents in writing or as required by Law, no
member of the CBS Group shall file any Adjustment Request with respect to any
Radio Separate Tax Return or any Joint Return for a Straddle Period if, in
each case, such Adjustment Request could reasonably be expected to increase
the Tax liability of any member of the Acquiror Group for any Tax Period or
Radio Group for any Post-Distribution Period. For any Joint Return for any
other Tax Period, unless required by Law, any such Adjustment Request filed by
any member of the CBS Group shall be done in good faith with respect to any
adverse Tax impact regarding any member of the Acquiror Group for any Tax
Period or Radio Group for any Post-Distribution Period.

Section 3.07  _Apportionment_ _of_ _Tax_ _Attributes_.

(a) Tax Attributes arising in a Pre-Distribution Period will be allocated to
(and the benefits and burdens of such Tax Attributes will inure to) the
members of the CBS Group and the members of the Radio Group in accordance with
the Code, Treasury Regulations, and any other applicable Tax Law, and, in the
absence of controlling legal authority or unless otherwise provided under this
Agreement (including Schedule 3.07(a) hereto),1 Tax Attributes shall be
allocated to the legal entity that created such Tax Attributes.

(b) On or before the first anniversary of the Distribution Date, CBS shall
deliver to Acquiror its determination in writing of the portion, if any, of
any Tax Attributes, overall foreign loss or other affiliated, consolidated,
combined, unitary, fiscal unity or other group basis Tax Attribute which is
allocated or apportioned to the members of the Radio Group under applicable
Tax Law and this Agreement (the "Proposed Allocation"). Acquiror shall have 60
days to review the Proposed Allocation and provide CBS any comments with
respect thereto. If Acquiror either provides no comments or provides comments
to which CBS agrees in writing, such resulting determination will become final
(the "Final Allocation"). If Acquiror provides comments to the Proposed
Allocation and CBS does not agree, the Final Allocation (or such portion(s) of
the Final Allocation as to which the Parties do not agree) will be determined
by a neutral accounting firm reasonably acceptable to the Parties (the
"Accounting Firm"). The Accounting Firm shall resolve the dispute according to
such procedures as the Accounting Firm deems advisable and shall furnish
written notice to the Parties of its resolution of any such dispute as soon
as practicable, but in any event no later than 45 days after its acceptance of
the matter for resolution. Any such resolution by the Accounting Firm shall be
consistent with the terms of this Agreement, and, if so consistent, shall
be conclusive on the Parties and shall be the Final Allocation (or shall
replace the disputed portion(s) of the Final Allocation, as applicable). In
accordance with Article 15, each Party shall pay its own fees and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of its representatives) incurred in
connection with the referral of the matter to the Accounting Firm, and all
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm in connection with such

 



   1  |

NTD: Schedule 3.07(a) to provide that Radio will be allocated that portion of
CBSs consolidated net capital loss generated by the Radio Business. 

---|--- 
 



16  referral shall be shared equally by the Companies. All members of the CBS
Group, Acquiror Group and Radio Group shall prepare all Tax Returns in
accordance the Final Allocation. In the event of an adjustment to any Tax
Attributes, overall foreign loss or other affiliated, consolidated, combined,
unitary, fiscal unity or other group basis attribute, CBS shall promptly
notify Acquiror in writing of such adjustment. For the avoidance of doubt,
CBS shall not be liable to any member of the Acquiror Group or Radio Group for
any failure of any determination under this _Section_ __ _ 3.07(b)_ to be
accurate under applicable Tax Law, provided such determination was made in
good faith.

(c) To the extent that the amount of any Tax Attribute is later reduced or
increased by a Tax Authority or Tax Proceeding, such reduction or increase
shall be allocated to the Party to which such Tax Attribute was allocated
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.07(a)_.

 

Article 4\. Calculation of Tax and Payments.

 

Section 4.01 _Payment_ _of_ _Liability_ _With_ _Respect_ _to_ _Tax_ _Due_.
Except as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 6.05_, at least 7 Business Days prior
to any Payment Date for any Tax Return for which CBS is the Responsible Party,
Acquiror and Radio shall pay to CBS the amount Acquiror and Radio are
responsible for under the provisions of _Article_ __ _ 2_ as calculated
pursuant to this Agreement. Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.05_, at
least 7 Business Days prior to any Payment Date for any Tax Return for which
Acquiror or Radio is the Responsible Party, CBS shall pay to Acquiror and
Radio the amount CBS is responsible for under the provisions of _Article_ __ _
2_ as calculated pursuant to this Agreement. To the extent a payment
attributable to estimated taxes is made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
4.01_, the amounts owed will be recomputed and appropriate adjustments shall
be made no later than December 31st of the year in which the Tax Return for
the full year with respect to which such estimated Tax payments were made is
filed.

Section 4.02  _Adjustments_ _Resulting_ _in_ _Underpayments_. In the case of
any adjustment pursuant to a Final Determination with respect to any Tax, the
Party to which such Tax is allocated pursuant to this Agreement shall pay to
the applicable Tax Authority when due any additional Tax required to be paid
as a result of such adjustment.

Section 4.03 _Method_   _for_ _Making_ _Payments_. All payments required to
be made under this Agreement shall be made by CBS directly to Acquiror and by
Acquiror directly to CBS; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Parties
mutually agree with respect to any such indemnification payment, any member
of the CBS Group, on the one hand, may make such indemnification payment to
any member of the Acquiror Group, on the other hand, and vice versa. Unless
otherwise specified in this agreement, all indemnification payments shall be
made within 10 Business Days of the receipt by the indemnifying party of
notification of the amount owed, together with reasonable documentation
showing the basis for the calculation of such amount and evidence of payment
of such amounts by the indemnified party to the relevant Tax Authority or
other recipient. All indemnification payments shall be treated in the manner
described in _Section_ __ _ 12.01_.

 



17 Article 5\. Refunds.

 

Section 5.01 _Refunds_.

 

(a) CBS shall be entitled to any Refund attributable to Taxes for which CBS is
liable hereunder and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall elect
to receive any such Refund as a cash refund rather than as a credit toward or
reduction in future Taxes. Acquiror or Radio shall be entitled to any Refund
attributable to Taxes for which Acquiror or Radio is liable hereunder and,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall elect to receive any such
Refund as a cash refund rather than as a credit toward or reduction in future
Taxes. To the extent that a Tax Authority requires CBS to apply or cause to be
applied an overpayment of Taxes for which Acquiror or Radio (after the
Effective Time) is liable under this Agreement as a credit toward or a
reduction in Taxes otherwise payable by CBS in lieu of a Refund and such
overpayment of Taxes, if received as a Refund, would have been payable by CBS
to Acquiror or Radio pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.01(a)_, CBS shall pay
such amount to Acquiror no later than the due date for filing the Tax Return
for which such overpayment is applied. To the extent that a Tax Authority
requires Acquiror or Radio (after the Effective Time) to apply or cause to be
applied an overpayment of Taxes for which CBS is liable under this Agreement
as a credit toward or a reduction in Taxes otherwise payable by Acquiror or
Radio (after the Effective Time) in lieu of a Refund and such overpayment of
Taxes, if received as a Refund, would have been payable by Acquiror or Radio
to CBS pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.01(a)_, Acquiror shall pay such
amount to CBS no later than the due date for filing the Tax Return for which
such overpayment is applied. A Party receiving a Refund to which another Party
is entitled hereunder shall pay such Refund to such other Party within 10
Business Days after such Refund is received or the benefit of such Refund is
realized.

(b) In the event of an adjustment pursuant to a Final Determination relating
to Taxes for which Acquiror and Radio, on the one hand, or CBS, on the other
hand, are or is responsible pursuant to _Article_ __ _ 2_ which would have
given rise to a Refund but for an offset against the Taxes for which the
other Party or Parties are or may be responsible pursuant to _Article_ __ _
2_ (the "Benefited Party"), then the Benefited Party shall pay to the other
Party or Parties, within 10 Business Days of the Final Determination of such
adjustment an amount equal to the amount of such reduction in the Taxes of the
Benefited Party plus interest at the Prime Rate on such amount for the period
from the filing date of the Tax Return that would have given rise to such
Refund to the payment date.

(c) To the extent that the amount of any Refund under this  _Section_ __ _
5.01_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.06_ is later reduced by a Tax Authority or in a Tax
Proceeding, such reduction shall be allocated to the Party to which such
Refund was allocated pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.01_ or _Section_ __
_ 3.06_, and an appropriate adjusting payment shall be made.

 

Article 6\. Tax-Free Status.

 

Section 6.01 _Representations_ _and_ _Warranties_.

 

(a) Acquiror hereby represents and warrants or covenants and agrees, as
appropriate, that the facts represented and the representations made in the
Representation Letters from

 



18  Acquiror (the "Acquiror Representation Letters"), to the extent (i)

proposals, intentions and policies of the Acquiror Group at any time, and
including the representation that Acquiror would not have consummated the
Merger but for the Distributions), or (B) the Radio Group (including the
plans, proposals, intentions and policies of Radio, its Subsidiaries, the
Radio Business or the Radio Group) after the Effective Time, or (ii) relating
to the actions or non-actions of the Radio Group to be taken (or not taken, as
the case may be) after the Effective Time, are, or will be from the time
presented or made through and including the Effective Time (and thereafter as
relevant) true, correct and complete in all respects.

 

(b) CBS hereby represents and warrants or covenants and agrees, as
appropriate, that (i) the facts presented and the representations made in the
Representation Letters, to the extent descriptive of (A) the CBS Group at any
time or (B) the Radio Group at any time at or prior to the Effective Time
(including, in each case, (x) the business purposes for each of
the Distributions described in the Representation Letters to the extent that
they relate to the CBS Group at any time or the Radio Group at any time at or
prior to the Effective Time, and (y) the plans, proposals, intentions and
policies of the CBS Group at any time or the Radio Group at any time prior to
the Effective Time), are, or will be from the time presented or made through
and including the Effective Time (and thereafter as relevant) true, correct
and complete in all respects.

 

(c) Each of CBS, Radio and Acquiror represents and warrants that it knows of
no fact (after due inquiry) that may cause the Tax treatment of the
Distributions or the Merger to be other than the Tax-Free Status.

(d) CBS represents and warrants that neither it, nor any of its Affiliates
has any plan or intent to take any action that is inconsistent with any
statements or representations made in the Representation Letters. Acquiror
represents that neither it, nor any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the
Effective Time, the members of the Radio Group), has any plan or intent to
take any action that is inconsistent with any statements or representations
made in the Acquiror Representation Letters.

 

Section 6.02 _Restrictions_ _Relating_ _to_ _the_ _Distributions_.

 

(a) Neither Acquiror nor Radio shall, and neither will permit any of its
Affiliates to, take or fail to take, as applicable, any action if such action
or failure to act would be inconsistent with or cause to be untrue any
statement, information, covenant or representation in the Acquiror
Representation Letters. Neither Acquiror nor Radio shall, and neither will
permit any of its Affiliates to, take or fail to take, as applicable, any
action if such action or failure to act would or reasonably could be expected
to adversely affect the Tax-Free Status of the Distributions or the Merger. 

(b) Each of Acquiror and Radio and each other member of their respective
Groups agrees that, from the date on which this Agreement is effective for
such Person pursuant to _Article_ __ _ 10_ until the first Business Day after
the two-year anniversary of the Distribution Date:

 

 _(i)_ Radio shall continue and cause to be continued the Radio Active Trade
or Business of the Radio SAG,

 



19 _(ii)_ Radio shall not voluntarily dissolve or liquidate (including
any action that is a liquidation for federal income tax purposes),

_(iii)_ neither Acquiror nor Radio shall enter into any Proposed Acquisition
Transaction or, to the extent Acquiror or Radio or any other member of their
respective Groups has the right to prohibit any Proposed Acquisition
Transaction, permit any Proposed Acquisition Transaction to occur (whether
by (A) redeeming rights under a shareholder rights plan, (B) finding a tender
offer to be a "permitted offer" under any such plan or otherwise causing any
such plan to be inapplicable or neutralized with respect to any
Proposed Acquisition Transaction, (C) approving any Proposed Acquisition
Transaction, whether for purposes of Section 203 of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware or any similar corporate statute, any "fair
price" or other provision of the charter or bylaws of Radio or Acquiror, as
applicable, (D) amending its certificate of incorporation to declassify its
Board of Directors or approving any such amendment, or otherwise),

 

 _(iv)_ neither Acquiror nor Radio (or any successor of Acquiror or Radio)
will, or will agree to, merge, consolidate or amalgamate with any other
Person (except as provided for under the Merger Agreement), _provided_ that
this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)(iv)_ shall not apply to mergers, consolidations
or amalgamations which do not result in Radio (or any successor) ceasing to
exist as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes,

_(v)_ Radio will not in a single transaction or series of transactions sell,
transfer, or otherwise dispose of or agree to sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of (including in any transaction treated for federal income tax
purposes as a sale, transfer or disposition), or permit any other member of
the Radio Group to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of or agree to sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of assets (including any shares of capital stock
of a Subsidiary) that, in the aggregate, constitute 30% or more of the gross
assets of the Radio Active Trade or Business (such percentage to be measured
based on fair market value as of the Distribution Date), in each case other
than (A) sales, transfers or dispositions of assets in the Ordinary Course
of Business, (B) any cash paid to acquire assets from an unrelated Person in
an arms-length transaction, (C) any assets transferred to a Person that is
disregarded as an entity separate from the transferor for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, (D) any mandatory or optional repayment (or pre-payment) of any
indebtedness of Radio or any member of the Radio Group, or (E) any sales,
transfers or other dispositions of assets within the Radio SAG,

_(vi)_ neither Acquiror nor Radio shall redeem or otherwise repurchase
(directly or through an Affiliate) any stock, or rights to acquire stock,
except to the extent such repurchases satisfy Section 4.05(1)(b) of Revenue
Procedure 96-30 (as in effect prior to the amendment of such Revenue
Procedure by Revenue Procedure 2003-48),

_(vii)_  neither Acquiror nor Radio will amend, or permit any other members
of their respective Groups to amend, its certificate of incorporation (or
other organizational

 



20  documents), or take any other action, whether through a stockholder vote or
otherwise, affecting the voting rights of Radio Capital Stock or Acquiror
Capital Stock (including, without limitation, through the conversion of one
class of Radio Capital Stock or Acquiror Capital Stock into another class of
Radio Capital Stock or Acquiror Capital Stock), or

 

 _(viii)_ neither Acquiror nor Radio shall take, or permit any other member of
its respective Group to take, any other action or actions (including any
action or transaction that would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
any representation made or to be made in the Acquiror Representation Letters)
which in the aggregate (and taking into account the Merger, and any other
transactions described in this subparagraph _(b)_ ) would be reasonably likely
to have the effect of causing or permitting one or more Persons (whether or
not acting in concert) to acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a
Fifty-Percent or Greater Interest in Acquiror or Radio (or any successor) or
would reasonably be expected to result in a failure to preserve the Tax-Free
Status;

 

in each case, unless prior to taking any such action set forth in the
foregoing clauses (i) through (viii), (A) Acquiror shall have requested
that CBS obtain a private letter ruling (including a supplemental ruling, if
applicable) from the IRS (a "Post-Distribution Ruling") in accordance with
_Sections_ __ _ 6.03(a)_ and _(c)_ of this Agreement to the effect that
such transaction will not affect the Tax-Free Status and CBS shall have
received such a Post-Distribution Ruling in form and substance satisfactory to
CBS in its reasonable discretion, (B) Acquiror or Radio shall have provided
CBS with an Unqualified Tax Opinion in form and substance satisfactory to CBS
in its reasonable discretion (and in determining whether an opinion is
satisfactory, CBS may consider, among other factors, the appropriateness of
any underlying assumptions and any management representations used as a basis
for the Unqualified Tax Opinion, and, for the avoidance of doubt, CBS may
determine that no opinion would be acceptable to CBS if such a determination
is reasonable) or (C) CBS shall have waived (which waiver may be withheld by
CBS in its sole and absolute discretion) the requirement to obtain such Post-
Distribution Ruling and/or Unqualified Tax Opinion.

 

Section 6.03 _Procedures_ _Regarding_ _Post_ _Distribution_ _Rulings_ _and_
_Unqualified_ _Tax_   _Opinions_.

(a) If Acquiror notifies CBS that it or Radio desires to take one of the
actions described in  _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_ (a "Notified Action"), CBS
shall cooperate with Acquiror and use its reasonable best efforts to seek to
obtain a Post-Distribution Ruling from the IRS or an Unqualified Tax
Opinion for the purpose of permitting Acquiror or Radio, as applicable, to
take the Notified Action, unless CBS shall have waived the requirement to
obtain such ruling or opinion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CBS shall not be
required to file or cooperate in the filing of any Ruling Request for a Post-
Distribution Ruling under this _Section 6.03(a)_ unless Acquiror represents
that (A) it has read the Ruling Request, and (B) all statements, information
and representations relating to any member of the Acquiror Group, contained
in such Ruling Request are (subject to any qualifications therein) true,
correct and complete. Acquiror shall reimburse CBS for all reasonable costs
and expenses, including out-of-pocket expenses and expenses relating to the
utilization of CBS personnel, incurred by the CBS Group in obtaining a Post-
Distribution Ruling or Unqualified Tax Opinion requested by Acquiror within
ten Business Days after receiving an invoice from CBS therefor.

 



21 (b) _Post-Distribution_ _Rulings_ _or_ _Unqualified_ _Tax_   _Opinions_ _at_
_CBS s_ _Request_. CBS shall have the right to obtain a Post-Distribution
Ruling or an Unqualified Tax Opinion at any time in its sole and absolute
discretion. If CBS determines to obtain a Post-Distribution Ruling or an
Unqualified Tax Opinion, Acquiror and Radio shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to) cooperate with CBS and take any and all actions
reasonably requested by CBS in connection with obtaining the Post-Distribution
Ruling or Unqualified Tax Opinion (including, without limitation, by making
any representation or covenant or providing any materials or information
reasonably requested by the IRS or Tax Advisor; _provided_ that Acquiror and
Radio shall not be required to make (or cause any member of the Acquiror
Group to make) any representation or covenant that is untrue or inconsistent
with historical facts or as to future matters or events over which matters or
events they have no control). CBS shall reimburse Acquiror for all reasonable
costs and expenses, including out-of-pocket expenses and expenses relating to
the utilization of Acquiror personnel, incurred by the Acquiror Group in
connection with such cooperation within ten Business Days after receiving an
invoice from Acquiror therefor.

(c) Except as provided in _Sections_ __ _ 6.03(a)_ and (b), following the
Distribution Date, neither Acquiror nor Radio shall, nor shall either Acquiror
or Radio permit their respective Affiliates to, seek any guidance from the IRS
or any other Tax Authority (whether written, verbal or otherwise) at any time
concerning any of the Distributions (including the impact of any other
transaction on the Distributions) unless Acquiror and Radio shall have
obtained the prior written consent of CBS, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 6.04 _Liability_ _for_ _Separation_   _Tax_ _Losses_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, the Separation Agreement or
the Merger Agreement to the contrary (and in each case regardless of whether
a Post-Distribution Ruling, Unqualified Tax Opinion or waiver described in
clauses (A), (B) or (C) of _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_ may have been provided),
but subject to  _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.07_, Acquiror and
Radio shall be responsible for any Separation Tax Losses that are attributable
to or result from any one or more of the following: (A) the acquisition
following the Merger of all or a portion of either or both of Acquirors
and/or Radios stock and/or of the Radio Groups assets by any means
whatsoever by any Person, (B) any negotiations, understandings, agreements or
arrangements by either or both of Acquiror and/or Radio or any other member of
their respective Groups (provided that, in the case of Radio or any other
member of the Radio Group, such negotiations, understandings, agreements or
arrangements follow the Merger) with respect to transactions or events
(including, without limitation, stock issuances, whether pursuant to the
exercise of stock options or otherwise, option grants, capital contributions
or acquisitions, or a series of such transactions or events), other than the
Merger or any transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the
Separation Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, that cause any of the
Distributions to be treated as part of a plan (which plan may include the
Merger) pursuant to which one or more Persons acquire directly or indirectly
stock of either or both of Acquiror and/or Radio representing a Fifty-Percent
or Greater Interest therein, as applicable, (C) any action or failure to act
by either or both of Acquiror and/or Radio or any other member of their

 



22  respective Groups (in the case of Radio or any member of the Radio Group,
after the Merger) (including, without limitation, any amendment to such
Persons certificate of incorporation (or other organizational documents),
whether through a stockholder vote or otherwise) affecting the voting rights
of either or both of Acquirors and/or Radios stock (including, without
limitation, through the conversion of one class of Radio Capital Stock or
Acquiror Capital Stock into another class of Radio Capital Stock or Acquiror
Capital Stock, but not including the composition of the Acquiror Board (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) as contemplated by Section 7.22(a) of
the Merger Agreement), other than entering into the Merger or any
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Separation Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement, (D) any act or failure to act by either or both of
Acquiror and/or Radio or any other member of their respective Groups that
would affect the Tax-Free Status of the Distributions or Merger (regardless
whether such act or failure to act may be covered by a Post-Distribution
Ruling, Unqualified Tax Opinion or waiver described in clauses (A), (B) or
(C) of _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_), other than entering into the Merger, or (E)
any breach or inaccuracy by either or both of Acquiror and/or Radio or
any other member of their respective Groups of any of their agreements or
representations set forth herein; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the case of an acquisition described in clause (A) of this
Section 6.04(a), which acquisition is made in the open market by any person
(x) who is not (i) a member of the Acquiror Group, (ii) an Affiliate of
Acquiror, (iii) an officer or director of Acquiror, (iv) a controlling
shareholder (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.355-7(h)(3)) of Acquiror, or (v) any other person acting with the implicit
or explicit permission of Acquiror, and (y) who was not solicited to
make such acquisition by any person described in subclauses (i), (ii), (iii),
(iv) or (v) of this sentence, then Acquiror and Radio shall be responsible for
only fifty percent (50%) of any Separation Tax Losses attributable to or
resulting from such acquisition.

(b) To the extent that any Separation Tax Loss reasonably could be subject to
indemnity under both  _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.06_,
responsibility for such Separation Tax Loss shall be shared by CBS, on the one
hand, and Acquiror and Radio, on the other hand, according to relative fault
as determined by the Parties in good faith.

Section 6.05 _Payment_ _of_ _Separation_ _Taxes_. Acquiror shall pay CBS the
amount of any Separation Tax Losses for which Acquiror and Radio are
responsible under _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ as a result of a Final Determination
no later than 5 Business Days after the date such Separation Tax Losses
are determined as a result of a Final Determination to be due.

Section 6.06 _Protective_ _Election_. If CBS determines, in its reasonable
discretion, that a protective election under Section 336(e) of the Code shall
be made with respect to the Final Distribution, Acquiror and Radio agree to
take any such action that is reasonably necessary to effect such election.
If such a protective election is made, then this Agreement shall be amended
in such a manner as is determined by the Parties to take into account the Tax
Benefits resulting from such election.

 

Section 6.07 _CBS_ _Actions_. If (a) (x) CBS waives, modifies or alters the
condition in Section 2.2(b) of the Separation Agreement or the condition in
Section 3.3(b) of the Separation Agreement and (y) CBS does not receive an
opinion from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, counsel to CBS, concluding at a
comfort level of "should" or higher that each of the Distributions qualifies
as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Code, or (b) CBS takes,

 



23  or fails to take, or permits any CBS Affiliate to take or fail to take, any
action, and solely as a result of such action or failure to act, together with
all other actions or failures to act by CBS and any CBS Affiliates, one or
more of the Distributions would reasonably be expected to fail to have Tax-
Free Status, then, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, the Separation
Agreement or the Merger Agreement to the contrary, (i) CBS shall promptly
provide notice to Acquiror of such fact; (ii) the Distribution Tax Opinion
shall no longer be considered valid or in effect for purposes of _Section_ __
_ 3.03(c)_; (iii) _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_ shall be of no force or effect;
(iv) no member of the Acquiror Group or Radio Group shall be responsible for
any Separation Tax Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ or otherwise; (v)
no member of the Acquiror Group or Radio Group shall be liable under _Section_
__ _ 2.05_ for the breach of any representation or covenant because any of
the Distributions fails to have Tax-Free Status; and (vi) the Parties shall
cooperate in good faith to revise the Proposed Allocation or Final Allocation
and to file any amended Tax Returns as required by Law.

 

Article 7\. Assistance and Cooperation.

 

Section 7.01 _Assistance_ _and_ _Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Parties shall cooperate (and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate) with each other and with each others agents, including accounting
firms and legal counsel, in connection with Tax matters relating to the
Parties and their Affiliates, including (i) preparation and filing of Tax
Returns, (ii) determining the liability for and amount of any Taxes
due (including estimated Taxes) or the right to and amount of any Tax
Benefit, (iii) examinations of Tax Returns, and (iv) any administrative or
judicial proceeding in respect of Taxes assessed or proposed to be assessed.
Such cooperation shall include making all information and documents in their
possession relating to any other Party and its Affiliates available to such
other Party as provided in _Article_ __ _ 8_. Each of the Parties shall also
make available to any other Party, as reasonably requested and available,
personnel (including officers, directors, employees and agents of the Parties
or their respective Affiliates) responsible for preparing, maintaining, and
interpreting information and documents relevant to Taxes, and personnel
reasonably required as witnesses or for purposes of providing information or
documents in connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings
relating to Taxes. Acquiror and Radio and each other member of their
respective Groups shall cooperate with CBS and take any and all actions
reasonably requested by CBS in connection with obtaining the Tax Opinions
(including, without limitation, by making any new representation or covenant,
confirming any previously made representation or covenant or providing any
materials or information reasonably requested by any Tax Advisor or Tax
Authority; provided that none of Radio, Acquiror or any other member of their
respective Groups shall be required to make or confirm any representation or
covenant that is inconsistent with historical facts or as to future matters or
events over which matters or events it has no control).

 

(b) Any information or documents provided under this _Article_ __ _ 7_ shall
be kept confidential by the Party receiving the information or documents,
except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or in connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings
relating to Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Merger Agreement, the Separation Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, (i)
neither CBS nor any CBS Affiliate shall be required to provide Radio, Acquiror
or any of

 



24  their respective Affiliates or any other Person access to or copies of any
information, documents or procedures (including the proceedings of any Tax
Contest) other than information, documents or procedures that relate solely
to a member of the Radio Group, the Radio Business or the assets of Radio or
any Radio Affiliate, (ii) neither Radio, Acquiror nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall be required to provide CBS or any CBS Affiliate or any other
Person access to or copies of any information, documents or procedures
(including the proceedings of any Tax Contest) other than information,
documents or procedures that relate solely to a member of the CBS Group, the
CBS Business or the assets of CBS or any CBS Affiliate, (iii) in no event
shall CBS or any CBS Affiliate be required to provide Radio, Acquiror, or any
of their respective Affiliates or any other Person access to or copies of any
information or documents if such action would or reasonably could be expected
to result in the waiver of any Privilege, and (iv) in no event shall Radio,
Acquiror or any of their respective Affiliates be required to provide CBS or
any CBS Affiliate or any other Person access to or copies of any information
or documents if such action would or reasonably could be expected to result in
the waiver of any Privilege. In addition, in the event that CBS reasonably
determines that the provision of any information or documents to Radio,
Acquiror or any of their respective Affiliates, or Radio or Acquiror
reasonably determines that the provision of any information or documents to
CBS or any CBS Affiliate, could be commercially detrimental, violate any Law
or agreement or waive any Privilege, the Parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to permit each others compliance with its obligations under this
_Article_ __ _ 7_ in a manner that avoids any such harm or consequence.

Section 7.02 _Tax_ _Return_ _Information_. Each of Radio, Acquiror and CBS,
and each member of their respective Groups, acknowledges that time is of the
essence in relation to any request for information, assistance or cooperation
made by CBS, Acquiror or Radio pursuant to this Agreement. Each of Radio,
Acquiror and CBS, and each member of their respective Groups, acknowledge
that failure to conform to the deadlines set forth in this Agreement could
cause irreparable harm. Each Party shall provide to the other Parties
information and documents relating to its Group reasonably required by the
other Parties to prepare Tax Returns, including any pro forma returns required
by the Responsible Party for purposes of preparing such Tax Returns. Any
information or documents the Responsible Party requires to prepare such Tax
Returns shall be provided in such form as the Responsible Party reasonably
requests and at or prior to the time reasonably specified by the Responsible
Party so as to enable the Responsible Party to file such Tax Returns on a
timely basis.

 

Section 7.03 _Reliance_ _by_ _CBS_. If any member of the Acquiror Group
supplies information to a member of the CBS Group in connection with Taxes
and an officer of a member of the CBS Group signs a statement or other
document under penalties of perjury in reliance upon the accuracy of such
information, then upon the written request of such member of the CBS
Group identifying the information being so relied upon, the chief financial
officer of Acquiror (or any officer of Radio or Acquiror as designated by the
chief financial officer of Acquiror) shall certify in writing that to his or
her knowledge (based upon consultation with appropriate employees) the
information so supplied is accurate and complete.

Section 7.04 _Reliance_   _by_ _Acquiror_ _and_ _Radio_. If any member of the
CBS Group supplies information to a member of the Acquiror Group or the Radio
Group in connection with Taxes and an officer of a member of the Acquiror
Group or the Radio Group, as applicable, signs a statement or other document
under penalties of perjury in reliance upon the accuracy of such

 



25  information, then upon the written request of such member of the Acquiror
Group or the Radio Group, as applicable, identifying the information being so
relied upon, the chief financial officer of CBS (or any officer of CBS as
designated by the chief financial officer of CBS) shall certify in writing
that to his or her knowledge (based upon consultation with appropriate
employees) the information so supplied is accurate and complete.

 

Article 8\. Tax Records.

 

Section 8.01 _Retention_ _of_ _Tax_ _Records_. Each Company shall preserve and
keep all Tax Records and related work papers and other documentation in its
possession as of the date hereof for so long as the contents thereof may
become material in the administration of any matter under the Code or other
applicable Tax Law, but in any event until the later of (i) the expiration of
any applicable statutes of limitations, or (ii) seven years after the
Distribution Date (such later date, the "Retention Date"). After the Retention
Date, each Company may dispose of such Tax Records upon 60 days prior
written notice to the other Parties. If, prior to the Retention Date, (a) a
Company reasonably determines that any Tax Records which it would otherwise be
required to preserve and keep under this  _Article_ __ _ 8_ are no longer
material in the administration of any matter under the Code or other
applicable Tax Law and the other Parties agree, then such first Party may
dispose of such Tax Records upon 60 days prior notice to the other Parties.
Any notice of an intent to dispose given pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.01_ shall include a list of the Tax Records to be disposed of describing in
reasonable detail each file, book, or other record accumulation being
disposed. The notified Party shall have the opportunity, at its cost and
expense, to copy or remove, within such 60-day period, all or any part of such
Tax Records. If, at any time prior to the Retention Date, a Company
determines to decommission or otherwise discontinue any computer program or
information technology system used to access or store any Tax Records, then
such Company may decommission or discontinue such program or system upon 60
days prior notice to the other Parties and the other Parties shall have the
opportunity, at their cost and expense, to copy, within such 60-day period,
all or any part of the underlying data relating to the Tax Records accessed
by or stored on such program or system.

Section 8.02 _Access_ _to_ _Tax_   _Records_. The Parties and their
respective Affiliates shall make available to each other for inspection and
copying during normal business hours upon reasonable notice all Tax Records
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, any pertinent underlying data accessed or
stored on any computer program or information technology system) in their
possession pertaining to (a) in the case of any Tax Return of the CBS Group,
the portion of such return that relates to Taxes for which the Radio Group or
the Acqiuror Group may be liable pursuant to this Agreement or (b) in the case
of any Tax Return of the Radio Group or the Acqiuror Group, the portion of
such return that relates to Taxes for which the CBS Group may be liable
pursuant to this Agreement, and shall permit the other Parties and their
Affiliates, authorized agents and representatives and any representative of a
Tax Authority or other Tax auditor direct access, at the cost and expense of
the requesting Party, during normal business hours upon reasonable notice to
any computer program or information technology system used to access or store
any Tax Records, in each case to the extent reasonably required by the other
Company in connection with the preparation of Tax Returns or financial
accounting statements, audits, litigation, or the resolution of items under
this Agreement.

 



26 Section 8.03 _Preservation_ _of_ _Privilege_. The Parties and
their respective Affiliates shall not provide access to, copies of, or
otherwise disclose to any Person any documentation relating to Taxes existing
prior to the Distribution Date to which Privilege may reasonably be asserted
without the prior written consent of the other Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Article 9. Tax Contests.

Section 9.01 _Notice_. Each of CBS, Radio and Acquiror shall provide prompt
notice to the other Parties of any written communication from a Tax Authority
regarding any pending Tax audit, assessment or proceeding or other Tax Contest
of which it becomes aware related to Taxes for Tax Period for which it
reasonably expects to be indemnified by another Party hereunder or for which
it reasonably may be required to indemnify another Party hereunder, or
otherwise relating to the Tax-Free Status of the Distributions or the Merger
(including the resolution of any Tax Contest relating thereto). Such notice
shall attach copies of the pertinent portion of any written communication from
a Tax Authority and contain factual information (to the extent known)
describing any asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall be
accompanied by copies of any notice and other documents received from any Tax
Authority in respect of any such matters. If an indemnified Party has
knowledge of an asserted Tax liability with respect to a matter for which it
is to be indemnified hereunder and such Party fails to give the indemnifying
Party prompt notice of such asserted Tax liability and the indemnifying Party
is entitled under this Agreement to contest the asserted Tax liability,
then (i) if the indemnifying Party is precluded from contesting the asserted
Tax liability in any forum as a result of the failure to give prompt notice,
the indemnifying Party shall have no obligation to indemnify the indemnified
Party for any Taxes arising out of such asserted Tax liability, and (ii) if
the indemnifying Party is not precluded from contesting the asserted Tax
liability in any forum, but such failure to give prompt notice results in a
material monetary detriment to the indemnifying Party, then any amount which
the indemnifying Party is otherwise required to pay the indemnified Party
pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount of such detriment.

 

Section 9.02 _Control_ _of_ _Tax_ _Contests_.

 

(a) _CBS_ _Control_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, CBS shall have the right to control any Tax Contest with respect to
any Tax matters relating to (i) a Joint Return, (ii) any member of the CBS
Group, (iii) any member of the Radio Group relating to the Pre-Distribution
Period, and (iv) Separation Tax Losses. Subject to _Sections_ __ _ 9.02(c)_
and _(d)_ , CBS shall have reasonable discretion with respect to any decisions
to be made, or the nature of any action to be taken, with respect to any
such Tax Contest relating to a Radio Separate Return for a Straddle Period,
and absolute discretion with respect to any decisions to be made, or the
nature of any action to be taken, with respect to any other such Tax Contest,
including exclusive authority with respect to any settlement of such Tax
liability.

(b) _Acquiror_ _Control_. Except as otherwise provided in this  _Section_ __
_ 9.02_, Acquiror shall have the right to control any Tax Contest with
respect to any member of the Radio Group to the extent related solely to any
Post-Distribution Period. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 9.02(c)_ and _(d)_ ,
Acqiuror shall have absolute discretion with respect to any decisions to be
made, or the nature of any action to be taken, with respect to any such Tax
Contest, including exclusive authority with respect to any settlement of such
Tax liability.

 



27 (c) _Settlement_ _Rights_. The Controlling Party shall have the sole right to
contest, litigate, compromise and settle any Tax Contest without obtaining
the prior consent of the Non-Controlling Party; provided, however, that, to
the extent any such Tax Contest may give rise to a claim for indemnity by the
Controlling Party or its Affiliates against the Non-Controlling Party or its
Affiliates under this Agreement, the Controlling Party shall not settle any
such Tax Contest without obtaining the prior written consent of the Non-
Controlling Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Subject
to _Section_ __ _ 9.02(e)_, and unless waived by the Parties in writing,
in connection with any potential adjustment in a Tax Contest as a result of
which adjustment the Non-Controlling Party may reasonably be expected to
become liable to make any indemnification payment to the Controlling Party
under this Agreement: (i) the Controlling Party shall keep the Non-Controlling
Party informed in a timely manner of all actions taken or proposed to be taken
by the Controlling Party with respect to such potential adjustment in such
Tax Contest; (ii) the Controlling Party shall timely provide the Non-
Controlling Party copies of any written materials relating to such
potential adjustment in such Tax Contest received from any Tax Authority;
(iii) the Controlling Party shall timely provide the Non-Controlling Party
with copies of any correspondence or filings submitted to any Tax Authority
or judicial authority in connection with such potential adjustment in such Tax
Contest; (iv) the Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling
Party and offer the Non-Controlling Party a reasonable opportunity to comment
before submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in connection
with such potential adjustment in such Tax Contest; and (v) the
Controlling Party shall defend such Tax Contest diligently and in good faith.
The failure of the Controlling Party to take any action specified in the
preceding sentence with respect to the Non-Controlling Party shall
not relieve the Non-Controlling Party of any liability and/or obligation
which it may have to the Controlling Party under this Agreement except to the
extent that the Non-Controlling Party was actually harmed by such failure,
and in no event shall such failure relieve the Non-Controlling Party from any
other liability or obligation which it may have to the Controlling Party. In
the case of any Tax Contest described in _Section_ __ _ 9.02(a)_ or _(b)_ ,
"Controlling Party" means the Company entitled to control the Tax Contest
under such Section and "Non-Controlling Party" means (x) CBS if Acquiror is
the Controlling Party and (y) Acquiror if CBS is the Controlling Party.

 

(d) _Tax_ _Contest_ _Participation_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.02(e)_, and
unless waived by the Parties in writing, the Controlling Party shall provide
the Non-Controlling Party with written notice reasonably in advance of, and
the Non-Controlling Party shall have the right to attend, any formally
scheduled meetings with Tax Authorities or hearings or proceedings before any
judicial authorities in connection with any potential adjustment in a Tax
Contest pursuant to which the Non-Controlling Party may reasonably be
expected to become liable to make any indemnification payment to the
Controlling Party under this Agreement. The failure of the Controlling Party
to provide any notice specified in this _Section_ __ _ 9.02(d)_ to the Non-
Controlling Party shall not relieve the Non-Controlling Party of any liability
and/or obligation which it may have to the Controlling Party under this
Agreement except to the extent that the Non-Controlling Party was actually
harmed by such failure, and in no event shall such failure relieve the Non-
Controlling Party from any other liability or obligation which it may have to
the Controlling Party.

 



28 (e) _CBS_ _Consolidated_ _Federal_ _Income_ _Tax_ _Return_. Notwithstanding
anything in this _Article_ __ _ 9_ to the contrary, in the case of a Tax
Contest related to (x) a CBS Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return or (y) any
other consolidated, combined or unitary Income Tax Return that includes any
member of the Radio Group, on the one hand, and any member of the CBS Group,
on the other hand, (i) the rights of Acquiror and Radio and their respective
Affiliates under _Section_ __ _ 9.02(c)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 9.02(d)_ shall
be limited in scope to the portion of such Tax Contest relating to Taxes for
which Acquiror or Radio may reasonably be expected to become liable to make
any indemnification payment to CBS under this Agreement, and (ii) CBS shall
have exclusive authority with respect to the settlement of such Tax Contest
and shall exercise such authority in good faith with respect to any adverse
Tax impact regarding any member of the Acquiror Group for any Tax Period or
Radio Group for any Post-Distribution Period.

(f) _Power_ _of_ _Attorney_. Each member of the Acquiror Group shall execute
and deliver to CBS (or such member of the CBS Group as CBS shall designate)
any power of attorney or other similar document reasonably requested by CBS
(or such designee) in connection with any Tax Contest (as to which CBS is
the Controlling Party) described in this _Article_ __ _ 9_ within 2 Business
Days of such request. Each member of the CBS Group shall execute and deliver
to Acquiror (or such member of the Acquiror Group as Acquiror shall
designate) any power of attorney or other similar document requested by
Acquiror (or such designee) in connection with any Tax Contest (as to which
Acquiror is the Controlling Party) described in this _Article_ __ _ 9_ within
2 Business Days of such request.

Article 10\. Effective Date. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
as between CBS and Radio, this Agreement shall become effective upon the
consummation of the Final Distribution, and as between CBS, Radio, and
Acquiror, this Agreement shall become effective upon the consummation of the
Merger.

 

Article 11\. Survival of Obligations. The representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement shall be unconditional
and absolute and shall remain in effect without limitation as to time.

 

Article 12\. Treatment of Payments.

 

Section 12.01 _Treatment_ _of_ _Tax_ _Indemnity_ _Payments_. In the absence of
any change in Tax treatment under the Code or except as otherwise required by
other applicable Tax Law, any payment required by this Agreement, the
Separation Agreement, the Merger Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (other
than any payment of interest accruing after the Distribution Date) shall be
reported for Tax purposes by the payor and the recipient as either a
contribution by CBS to Radio or a distribution by Radio to CBS, as the case
may be, occurring immediately prior to the Final Distribution (but only
to the extent the payment does not relate to a Tax allocated to the payor in
accordance with Section 1552 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations
thereunder or Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-33(d) (or under
corresponding principles of other applicable Tax Laws)) or as payments of an
assumed or retained liability. Except to the extent provided in Section 12.02,
any Tax indemnity payment made by a Company under this Agreement shall
be increased as necessary so that after making all payments in respect of
Taxes imposed on or attributable to such indemnity payment, the recipient
Company receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
Taxes been imposed.

 



29 Section 12.02 _Interest_ _Under_ _This_ _Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, to the extent one Party ("Indemnitor") makes a payment
of interest to another Party ("Indemnitee") under this Agreement with respect
to the period from the date that the Indemnitee made a payment of Tax to a
Tax Authority to the date that the Indemnitor reimbursed the Indemnitee for
such Tax payment, the interest payment shall be treated as interest expense to
the Indemnitor (deductible to the extent provided by Law) and as interest
income by the Indemnitee (includible in income to the extent provided by Law).
The amount of the payment shall not be adjusted to take into account any
associated Tax Benefit to the Indemnitor or increase in Tax to the Indemnitee.

 

Article 13\. Disagreements.

 

Section 13.01 _Discussion_. The Parties mutually desire that friendly
collaboration will continue between them. Accordingly, they will endeavor,
and they will cause their respective Group members to endeavor, to resolve in
an amicable manner all disagreements and misunderstandings connected with
their respective rights and obligations under this Agreement, including
any amendments hereto. In furtherance thereof, in the event of any dispute or
disagreement between any member of the CBS Group and any member of the
Acquiror Group as to the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement or
the performance of obligations hereunder (a "Dispute"), the Tax departments
of the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the Dispute.

 

Section 13.02 _Escalation_.

 

(a) If such good faith negotiations do not resolve the Dispute, then the
matter will be resolved through the procedures provided in Article VII of the
Separation Agreement.

Article 14\. Late Payments. Any amount owed by one Party to another Party
under this Agreement which is not paid when due shall bear interest at the
Prime Rate plus two percent, compounded semiannually, from the due date of the
payment to the date paid. To the extent interest required to be paid under
this _Article_ __ _ 14_ duplicates interest required to be paid under any
other provision of this Agreement, interest shall be computed at the higher of
the interest rate provided under this  _Article_ __ _ 14_ or the interest
rate provided under such other provision.

Article 15. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each
Party and its Affiliates shall bear their own expenses incurred in connection

Taxes under the provisions of this Agreement.

remedy or in requiring satisfaction of any condition, except to the extent
that the Party specifically waives the same in writing. A written waiver given
for one matter or occasion is effective only in that instance and only for the
purpose stated. A waiver once given is not to be construed as a waiver for
any other matter or occasion. Any enumeration of a Partys rights and remedies
in this Agreement is not intended to be exclusive, and a Partys rights and
remedies are intended to be cumulative to the extent permitted by law and
include any rights and remedies authorized in law or in equity.

31 Section 16.06 _Further_ _Action_. The Parties shall execute and deliver
all documents, provide all information, and take or refrain from taking
action as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes

other Party in accordance with  _Article_ __ _ 9_.

Section 16.07 _Integration_. This Agreement, together with each of the

members of the CBS Group, on the one hand, and any member or members of the
Radio Group, on the other hand. In the event of any inconsistency between this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement, or any other
agreements relating to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement

provisions of this Agreement shall control.

Agreement, a Party shall not be required to exhaust all remedies available
under other agreements or at law or equity before recovering under the
remedies provided in this Agreement.

Section 16.10 _Counterparts_. The Parties may execute this Agreement in
multiple counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against the
Party that signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement. This
Agreement is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from each
Party to the other Party. The signatures of the Parties need not appear on
the same counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or
email transmission that includes a copy of the sending Partys signature is as
effective as signing and delivering the counterpart in person.

Section 16.11 _Governing_ _Law_. The internal laws of the State of New York
(without reference to its principles of conflicts of law) govern the
construction, interpretation and other matters arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement and each of the exhibits hereto and thereto (whether
arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise). 

Section 16.12 _Jurisdiction_. If any dispute arises out of or in connection
with this Agreement, except as expressly contemplated by another provision of

to any of the Parties (including but not limited to any successor of CBS,
Acquiror or Radio succeeding to the Tax Attributes of either under Section 381
of the Code), to the same extent as if such successor had been an original
party to this Agreement. Other than as permitted in the previous sentence,
neither Party may assign its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of the other Party.

 

Section 16.16 _Injunctions_. The Parties acknowledge that irreparable damage
may occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement,
including _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, were not performed

SERVICES, DURATION AND SERVICES MANAGERS

 

Section 2.01. _Services_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (a) CBS shall provide or cause to be provided to the Entercom
Group the services listed on _Schedule A_ to this Agreement (the " _CBS
Services_ ") and (b) Entercom shall provide or cause to be provided to the CBS
Group the services listed on _Schedule B_ to this Agreement (the " _Radio
Services_ ," and, collectively with the CBS Services, any Additional Services,
any Service Increases and any New Services, the " _Services_ "). All of the
CBS Services shall be for the sole use and benefit of the Radio Business and
all of the Radio Services shall be for the sole use and benefit of the CBS
Business.

Section 2.02.  _Duration of Services_. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, each of CBS and Entercom shall provide or cause to be provided to
the respective Recipients each Service until the earlier to occur of, with
respect to each such Service, (i) the expiration of the term for such Service
(or, subject to the terms of Section 7.01(d), the expiration of any Service
Extension) as set forth on _Schedule A_ or _Schedule B_ (each a " _Schedule_
," and, collectively, the " _Schedules_ ") or (ii) the date on which such
Service is terminated under _Section 7.01(b)_.

 

Section 2.03. _Additional Unspecified Services; Changes_.

 

(a) After the date of this Agreement, if (i) (x) Entercom identifies a service
(other than a Digital Service) that the CBS Group provided to the Radio Group
prior to the Separation that Entercom reasonably needs in order for the Radio
Business to continue to operate in substantially the same manner in which the
Radio Business operated prior to the Separation, and such service was
included on the initial draft of _Schedule A_ provided by CBS prior to the
execution of the Merger Agreement but thereafter removed, or (y) CBS
identified a service (other than a Digital Service) that the Radio Group
provided to the CBS Group prior to the Separation that CBS reasonably needs
in order for the CBS Business to continue to operate in substantially the same
manner in which the CBS Business operated prior to the Separation, and such
service was included on the initial draft of _Schedule B_ provided by CBS
prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement but thereafter removed, and
(ii) the requesting Party provides written notice to the other Party within
120 days following the date of this Agreement requesting such additional
services, then such other Party shall provide such requested additional
services (such requested additional services, the " _Additional Services_ ").
In connection with any request for Additional Services in accordance with
this _Section 2.03(a)_, the CBS Services Manager and the Radio Services
Manager shall in good faith negotiate the terms of a supplement to the
applicable Schedule, which terms shall be consistent with the terms of, and
the pricing methodology used for, similar Services provided under this
Agreement. Upon the mutual written agreement of the Parties, the supplement to
the applicable Schedule shall describe in reasonable detail the nature, scope,
service period(s), termination provisions and other terms applicable to such
Additional Services in a manner similar to that in which the Services are
described in the existing Schedules. Each supplement to the applicable
Schedule, as agreed to in writing by the Parties, shall be deemed part of
this Agreement as of the date of such agreement, and the Additional Services
set forth therein shall be deemed "Services" provided under this Agreement, in
each case subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



-4- (b) After the date of this Agreement, if (i) a Recipient requests to increase,
relative to historical levels prior to the Separation, the volume, amount,
level or frequency, as applicable, of any Service provided by the Provider of
such Service and (ii) such increase is reasonably determined by such Recipient
as necessary for the Recipient to operate its businesses (such increases, the
" _Service Increases_ "), then such Provider shall consider such request in
good faith; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be obligated to
provide any Service Increase, including because, after good-faith
negotiations between the Parties, the Parties fail to reach an agreement with
respect to the terms thereof (including with respect to Service Charges
therefor) or if and to the extent such Service Increase would require a
material increase in the resources dedicated by Provider to the Services. In
connection with any request for Service Increases in accordance with this
_Section 2.03(b)_, the CBS Services Manager and the Radio Services Manager
shall in good faith negotiate the terms of an amendment to the applicable
Schedule, which amendment shall be consistent with the terms of, and the
pricing methodology used for, the applicable Service. Each amended Schedule,
as agreed to in writing by the Parties, shall be deemed part of this
Agreement as of the date of such agreement, and the Service Increases set
forth therein shall be deemed a part of the "Services" provided under this
Agreement, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

(c) The Parties may, in accordance with the procedures specified in this 
_Section 2.03(c)_, agree to modify the terms and conditions relating to the
performance of or payment for a previously agreed-upon Service in order to
reflect, among other things, new procedures, processes or other methods of
providing such Service (a " _Service Modification_ ").

(i) _Change Requests_. In the event either of the Parties desires a Service
Modification, the Party requesting the Service Modification will deliver a
written description of the proposed Service Modification (a " _Change Request_
") to the other Partys Services Manager. Unless the Party receiving the
Change Request agrees to implement the Change Request as proposed, the
Services Managers will meet in person or by telephone to discuss in good faith
the Change Request no later than ten (10) Business Days after delivery of
the Change Request to the other Party.

(ii) _Approval of Recipient Change Requests_. All Change Requests from a
Recipient must be consented to by the applicable Providers Services Manager
in writing before the Service Modification may be implemented. Such consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For the purposes of
the preceding sentence, the Parties agree that it is not unreasonable to: (i)
withhold such consent to the extent that such proposed Service Modification
would materially increase the resources provided by Provider after giving
effect to the Change Request, or (ii) condition such consent on Recipient
agreeing to bear any reasonable and documented increase in Providers cost of
performance.

 

(iii) _Approval of Provider Change Requests_. All Change Requests from a
Provider must be consented to by the applicable Recipients Service Manager
in writing before the Service Modifications may be implemented. Such consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For the purposes of
the preceding sentence, the Parties agree that it is not unreasonable to: (i)
withhold such consent to the extent that such proposed Service Modification
would materially decrease the resources

 



-5-  provided by Provider or otherwise materially adversely affect Providers
performance of the Services after giving effect to the Change Request, or (ii)
condition such consent on Provider agreeing to bear any cost increases.

(iv) _Implementation of Approved Change._ If a Change Request is approved in
accordance with this Section, the corresponding Schedule and the definition of
Services will be deemed amended as agreed by the Parties to reflect the
implementation of the Change Request as well as any conditions or other terms
agreed upon by the Parties in writing.

Section 2.04. _New Services_. (a) From time to time during the term of this
Agreement, either Party may request the other Party to provide additional or
different services (other than Digital Services) which such other Party is not
expressly obligated to provide under this Agreement (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Additional Services or Service Increases, the " _New
Services_ "). The Party receiving such request shall consider such request in
good faith; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be obligated to
provide any New Services, including because, (i) after good faith
negotiations between the Parties pursuant to _Section 2.04(b)_, the Parties
fail to reach an agreement with respect to the terms (including the Service
Charges) applicable to the provision of such New Services or (ii) it does
not, in its reasonable judgment, have adequate resources to provide such New
Service or if the provision of such New Service would significantly disrupt
the operation of its businesses.

 

(b) In connection with any request for New Services in accordance with
_Section 2.04(a)_, the CBS Services Manager and the Radio Services Manager
shall in good faith (i) negotiate the applicable Service Charge and the terms
of a supplement to the applicable Schedule, which supplement shall describe in
reasonable detail the nature, scope, service period(s),
termination provisions and other terms applicable to such New Services and
(ii) determine any costs and expenses, including any start-up costs and
expenses, that would be incurred by the Provider in connection with the
provision of such New Services, which costs and expenses shall be borne
solely by the Recipient. Each supplement to the applicable Schedule, as agreed
to in writing by the Parties, shall be deemed part of this Agreement as of the
date of such agreement, and the New Services set forth therein shall be
deemed "Services" provided under this Agreement, in each case subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.05. _Services Not Included_. Except as expressly set forth on a
Schedule, it is not the intent of the Provider to render, nor of the
Recipient to receive from the Provider, professional advice or opinions,
whether with regard to Tax, legal, treasury, finance, employment or other
business or financial matters, technical advice, whether with regard to
information technology or other matters, or the handling of or addressing
environmental matters; the Recipient shall not rely on, or construe, any
Service rendered by or on behalf of the Provider as such professional advice
or opinions or technical advice; and the Recipient shall seek all third-party
professional advice or opinions or technical advice as it may desire or need.

Section 2.06.  _Transition Services Managers_. (a) CBS hereby appoints and
designates the individual holding the CBS position set forth on _Exhibit I_ to
act as its initial services manager (the " _CBS Services Manager_ "), who will
be directly responsible for coordinating and managing the delivery of the CBS
Services and have authority to act on CBSs behalf with respect to

 



-6-  matters relating to the provision of Services under this Agreement. The CBS
Services Manager will work with the personnel of the CBS Group to periodically
address issues and matters raised by the Entercom Group relating to the
provision of Services under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the requirements
of _Section 8.06_, all communications from the Entercom Group to CBS pursuant

_CBS Local Service Manager_ ") with respect to such Service on _Schedule A_ or
such other individual as may be specified by the CBS Services Manager in
writing and delivered to Entercom by email or facsimile transmission with
receipt confirmed; provided that, if the CBS Local Service Manager is not
available, communication shall thereafter be made through the CBS
Services Manager. CBS shall notify Entercom of the appointment of a different
CBS Services Manager or CBS Local Service Manager(s), if necessary, in
accordance with _Section 8.06_.

 

(b) Entercom hereby appoints and designates the individual holding the Radio
position set forth on _Exhibit I_ to act as its initial services manager (the
" _Radio Services Manager_ "), who will be directly responsible for
coordinating and managing the delivery of the Radio Services and have
authority to act on Entercoms behalf with respect to matters relating to
this Agreement. The Radio Services Manager will work with the personnel of the
CBS Group to periodically address issues and matters raised by CBS relating to
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the requirements of _Section 8.06_,
all communications from CBS to Entercom pursuant to this Agreement regarding
routine matters involving a Service shall be made through the individual
specified as the local service manager (the " _Radio Local Service Manager_ ")
with respect to such Service on _Schedule B_ or as specified by the Radio
Services Manager in writing and delivered to CBS by email or facsimile
transmission with receipt confirmed; provided that if the Radio Local Service
Manager is not available, communication shall thereafter be made through the
Radio Services Manager. Entercom shall notify CBS of the appointment of a
different Radio Services Manager or Radio Local Service Manager(s), if
necessary, in accordance with  _Section 8.06_.

(c) The Parties shall cause their respective Service Managers and/or Local
Service Managers, as applicable, to meet (in person or by phone or
videoconference) on a monthly basis during the Term, or with such other
frequency as they may mutually agree in good faith as is necessary to support
an orderly transition of the Radio Business. At such meetings, the Service
Managers or Local Service Managers shall discuss the performance of the
Services and any concerns of the Parties or a Party regarding such Services
(including the provision of and payment for the Services provided under this
Agreement, potential changes to systems or personnel used to perform the
Service, and/or the status of the Parties transition efforts to achieve the
Cutover).

 

Section 2.07. _Personnel_. (a) The Provider of any Service will make available
to the Recipient of such Service such appropriately qualified personnel as
may be necessary to provide such Service on the understanding that such
personnel shall remain employed and/or engaged by the Provider. The Provider
will have the right, in its reasonable discretion, to (i) designate which
personnel it will assign to perform such Service and (ii) remove and replace
such personnel at any time; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such removal or
replacement shall not be the basis for any increase in any Service Charge or
Reimbursement Charge payable hereunder or relieve the Provider of its
obligation to provide any Service hereunder; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Provider will use its commercially reasonable efforts to limit the
disruption to the Recipient in the transition of the Services to different
personnel.

 



-7- (b) In the event that the provision of any Service by the Provider requires
the cooperation and services of the personnel of the Recipient, the Recipient
will make available to the Provider such personnel (who shall be appropriately
qualified for purposes of so supporting the provision of such Service by the
Provider) as may be necessary for the Provider to provide such Service on the
understanding that such personnel shall remain employed and/or engaged by the
Recipient. The Recipient will have the right, in its reasonable discretion, to
(i) designate which personnel it will make available to the Provider in
connection with the provision of such Service and (ii) remove and replace such
personnel at any time; _provided_ , _however_ , that any directly resulting
increase in costs to the Provider shall be borne by the Recipient and any
directly resulting adverse effect to the provision of such Service by the
Provider shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Recipient will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to limit the disruption to the Provider in the transition of such personnel.

(c) No Provider shall be liable under this Agreement for any liabilities
incurred by the Recipient Indemnified Parties that are primarily attributable
to, or that are primarily a consequence of, any actions or inactions of the
personnel of the Recipient, except for any such actions or
inactions undertaken pursuant to the direction of the Provider.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall grant the Provider, or its employees or
agents that are performing the Services, the right directly or indirectly to
control or direct the operations of the Recipient or any member of its Group.
Such employees and agents shall not be required to report to the management of
the Recipient nor be deemed to be under the management or direction of the
Recipient. The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that, except as may be
expressly set forth herein as a Service (including any Additional Services,
Service Increases or New Services) or otherwise expressly set forth in the
Separation Agreement, another Ancillary Agreement or any other applicable
agreement, no Provider or any member of its Group shall be obligated to
provide, or cause to be provided, any service or goods to any Recipient
or any member of its Group.

ADDITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS

 

Section 3.01. _Software and Software Licenses_. (a) If and to the extent
requested by Entercom, CBS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist Entercom in its efforts to obtain licenses (or other appropriate
rights) to use, duplicate and distribute, as necessary and applicable, certain
computer software necessary for CBS to provide, and the Radio Business
to receive, CBS Services; _provided_ that CBS shall not be required to pay
any fees or other payments or incur any obligations or liabilities to enable
Entercom to obtain any such license or rights (except and to the extent that
Entercom advances such fees or payments to CBS); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that CBS shall not be required to seek broader rights or more favorable terms
for Entercom than those applicable to CBS or Radio, as the case may be, prior
to the Separation or as may be applicable to CBS from time to time hereafter;
and, _provided_ , _further_ , that Radio shall bear only those costs that
relate solely and directly to obtaining such licenses (or other

 



-8-  appropriate rights) in the ordinary course. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that there can be no assurance that CBSs efforts will be successful or
that Entercom will be able to obtain such licenses or rights on acceptable
terms or at all, and, where CBS enjoys rights under any enterprise or site
license or similar license, the Parties acknowledge that such license
typically precludes partial transfers or assignments or operation of a
service bureau on behalf of unaffiliated entities. In the event that Entercom
is unable to obtain such software licenses, the Parties shall work together
using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an alternative software
license to allow CBS to provide, and the Radio Business to receive, such CBS
Services, and the Parties shall negotiate in good faith an amendment to the
applicable Schedule to reflect any such new arrangement.

 

(b) If and to the extent requested by CBS, Entercom shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist CBS in its efforts to obtain licenses (or other
appropriate rights) to use, duplicate and distribute, as necessary and
applicable, certain computer software necessary for Entercom to provide, and
CBS to receive, Radio Services; _provided_ that Radio shall not be required to
pay any fees or other payments or incur any obligations or liabilities to
enable CBS to obtain any such license or rights (except and to the extent that
CBS advances such fees or payments to Radio); _provided_ , _further_ , that
Entercom shall not be required to seek broader rights or more favorable terms
for CBS than those applicable to Radio or CBS, as the case may be, prior to
the date of this Agreement or as may be applicable to Entercom from time to
time hereafter; and, provided, further, that CBS shall bear only those costs
that relate solely and directly to obtaining such licenses (or other
appropriate rights) in the ordinary course. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that there can be no assurance that Entercoms efforts will be successful or
that CBS will be able to obtain such licenses or rights on acceptable terms or
at all, and, where Entercom enjoys rights under any enterprise or site license
or similar license, the Parties acknowledge that such license typically
precludes partial transfers or assignments or operation of a service bureau on
behalf of unaffiliated entities. In the event that CBS is unable to obtain
such software licenses, the Parties shall work together using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain an alternative software license to allow
Entercom to provide, and CBS to receive, such Radio Services, and the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith an amendment to the applicable Schedule to
reflect any such new arrangement.

 

(c) In the event that there are any costs associated with obtaining software
licenses in accordance with this _Section 3.01_ that (i) would not be
payable in the ordinary course, including in the form of a "transfer fee" or
other similar fees or expenses payable by the Recipient or the Provider and
(ii) would not have been payable by the Recipient or the Provider absent the
need for a consent or waiver in connection with the license that the Recipient
is seeking to obtain, such costs shall be borne by the Recipient.

 

Section 3.02. _Access to Facilities_. (a) Entercom shall, and shall cause
other members of the Entercom Group to, allow CBS and its Representatives
reasonable access to the facilities of the Entercom Group necessary for CBS to
fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

 

(b) CBS shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, allow Entercom and its
Representatives reasonable access to the facilities of the CBS Group
necessary for Entercom to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

 



-9- (c) Notwithstanding the other rights of access of the Parties under this
Agreement, each Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford the
other Party, its Subsidiaries and Representatives, following not less than
five (5) business days prior written notice from the other Party, reasonable
access during normal business hours to the facilities, information, systems,
infrastructure and personnel of the relevant Providers as reasonably necessary
for the other Party to verify the adequacy of internal controls over
information technology, reporting of financial data and related processes
employed in connection with the Services, including in connection with
verifying compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
_provided_ , _however_ , such access shall not unreasonably interfere with
any of the business or operations of such Party or its Subsidiaries.

(d) Except as otherwise permitted by the other Party in writing, each Party
shall permit only its authorized Representatives, contractors, invitees or
licensees to access the other Partys facilities.

 

(e) Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties, each Party will: (i)
use the facilities of the other Party solely for the purpose of providing or
receiving the Services, as applicable, and not to provide goods or services to
or for the benefit of any third party or for any unlawful purpose; (ii) comply
with all reasonable policies and procedures governing access to and use of
the other Partys facilities made known to the accessing Party in advance,
including, without limitation, all reasonable security requirements applicable
to accessing the facilities and any systems, technologies, or assets
of Buyer; (iii) instruct its Representatives, when visiting the other Partys
facilities, not to photograph or record, duplicate, remove, disclose, or
transmit to a third party any of the other Partys information, except as
necessary to perform the Services; and (iv) return such space to the other
Party in the same condition it was in prior to the accessing Partys use of
such space, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

 

Section 3.03. _Cooperation; Cutover_.

 

(a) It is understood that it will require the significant efforts of both
Parties to implement this Agreement and to ensure performance of this
Agreement by the Parties at the agreed-upon levels in accordance with all of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Parties will cooperate, acting
in good faith and using commercially reasonable efforts, to effect a smooth
and orderly transition of the Services provided under this Agreement from the
Provider to the Recipient (including repairs and maintenance Services and the
assignment or transfer of the rights and obligations under any third-party
contracts relating to the Services); _provided_ , _however_ , that this
_Section 3.03_ shall not require either Party to incur any out-of-pocket
costs or expenses unless reimbursed by the other Party.

 

(b) Recipient shall be responsible for planning and preparing for the
transition to its own internal organization or other third-party
service providers the provision of all of the Services in a timely manner,
such transition to be completed by the end of the Term (the " _Cutover_ "). At
Recipients request, Provider shall meet with Recipient upon reasonable notice
and at a mutually agreeable time, following such request to assist Recipient
with the initial development of a plan for Cutover (the " _Cutover Plan_ ")
and shall, in good faith, provide Recipient with all information in the
possession of Provider related to the Services reasonably requested by the
Recipient that is necessary for the development and implementation of the

 



-10-  Cutover Plan. Recipient shall prepare a Cutover Plan with sufficient lead
time in order to achieve a timely Cutover. Once the Cutover Plan is prepared,
Recipient shall promptly provide Provider a copy of the Cutover Plan, and
Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in
implementing the Cutover Plan, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Separation Agreement, any other Ancillary Agreement or
any other applicable agreement.

Section 3.04. _Data Protection; System Security_.

 

(a) The Provider shall only process personal data which it may receive from
the Recipient, while carrying out its duties under this Agreement, (i) in
such a manner as is necessary to carry out those duties, (ii) in accordance
with the instructions of the Recipient, (iii) using appropriate technical and
organizational measures to prevent the unauthorized or unlawful processing of
such personal data and/or the accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to,
such personal data and (iv) in compliance with all applicable Laws.

 

(b) The Provider will maintain and enforce physical, technical and logical
security procedures with respect to the access and maintenance of any
Confidential Information of the Recipient that is in the Providers possession
in performing the Services, which procedures shall: (i) be in full compliance
with applicable Law and (ii) conform with the Providers information security
policies. With respect to any Provider systems that are used to store or
process data or other information of Recipient, Provider shall maintain and
implement the same backup, redundancy, and disaster avoidance and recovery
policies and procedures as Provider does with respect to the systems it uses
to store or process its own data and information. In the event there is a
material security breach which could reasonably be expected to have resulted
in unauthorized access to, or alteration, destruction or corruption of, any
data or information of Recipient, Provider will notify Recipient of such
breach immediately. The Provider will use diligent efforts to remedy such
breach of security or unauthorized access in a timely manner.

ARTICLE IV

 

COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS

 

Section 4.01. _Costs and Disbursements_. (a) Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, a Recipient of Services shall pay to the Provider of such
Services a monthly fee for the Services (or category of Services, as
applicable) (each fee constituting a " _Service Charge_ " and, collectively, "
_Service Charges_ ") as listed on the Schedules hereto; _provided_ that
Entercom shall have a credit of $7,500,000 (the " _Services Credit_ "), which
credit shall be applied to the first $7,500,000 of Service Charges invoiced by
CBS hereunder and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Services Credit shall
expire one year after the Effective Time (the "Credit Termination Date") and
Entercom shall not be permitted to apply any of the Services Credit to any
services invoiced by CBS to Entercom after the Credit Termination Date; and
accordingly, Entercom shall have no obligation to pay any Service Charges
until the aggregate Service Charges invoice exceeds $7,500,000. Subject to
Section 4.01(b), the Service Charges shall be no greater than the transfer
pricing or other internal cost allocation utilized by CBS for the Radio
Services and the CBS Services prior to the Separation, as disclosed by CBS to
Entercom prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement.

 



-11- (b) During the term of this Agreement, the amount of a Service Charge for any
Services (or category of Services, as applicable) may increase to the extent
of: (i) any increases mutually agreed to by the Parties, (ii) any Service
Charges applicable to any Additional Services, Service Increases or New
Services and (iii) any increase in the rates or charges imposed by any
unaffiliated third-party provider that is providing Services, _provided_ that,
Provider shall provide Recipient with as much advance notice as is reasonably
possible of any such increases imposed by a third-party provider. Together
with any monthly invoice for Service Charges and Reimbursement Charges, the
Provider shall provide the Recipient with documentation to support the
calculation of such Service Charges or any Reimbursement Charges. 

(c) The Recipient shall reimburse the Provider for reasonable unaffiliated
third-party out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Provider or its
Affiliates in connection with providing the Services (including necessary
travel-related expenses) (each such cost or expense, a " _Reimbursement
Charge_ " and, collectively, " _Reimbursement Charges_ ");  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such cost or expense that is materially inconsistent with
historical practice between the Parties for any Service (including business
travel and related expenses) shall require advance approval of the Recipient.
Any authorized travel-related expenses incurred in performing the Services
shall be incurred and charged to the Recipient in accordance with the
Providers then-applicable business travel policies made known to the
Recipient.

 

(d) The Service Charges and Reimbursement Charges due and payable hereunder
shall be invoiced and paid in U.S. dollars. The Recipient shall pay the
amount of each monthly invoice by wire transfer (or such other method of
payment as may be agreed between the Parties) to the Provider within sixty
(60) days of the receipt of each such invoice, including appropriate
documentation as described herein. In the absence of a timely notice of
billing dispute in accordance with the provisions of Article VII of the
Separation Agreement, if the Recipient fails to pay such amount by the due
date, the Recipient shall be obligated to pay to the Provider, in addition to
the amount due, interest at an annual default interest rate of three percent
(3%), or the maximum legal rate, whichever is lower (the " _Interest Payment_
"), accruing from the date the payment was due through the date of actual
payment. In the event of any billing dispute, the Recipient shall promptly pay
any undisputed amount.

(e) Subject to the confidentiality provisions set forth in _Section 8.03_,
each Party shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, provide,
upon ten (10) days prior written notice from the other Party, any
information within such Partys or its Affiliates possession that the
requesting Party reasonably requests in connection with any Services being
provided to such requesting Party by an unaffiliated third-party provider,
including any applicable invoices, agreements documenting the arrangements
between such third-party provider and the Provider and other supporting
documentation.

 

Section 4.02. _Tax Matters_. (a) Without limiting any provisions of this
Agreement, the Recipient shall be responsible for and shall promptly pay (i)
all excise, sales, use, transfer, stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and
other similar Taxes and (ii) any related interest and penalties, excluding in
each case any Taxes imposed on or measured by income (collectively, " _Non-
Income Taxes_ "), in each case imposed or assessed as a result of the
provision of Services by the Provider. Upon the written request of the
Provider, the Recipient shall submit evidence of payment of such Non-Income
Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority. The Provider

 



-12-  agrees that it shall take commercially reasonable actions to cooperate with
the Recipient in obtaining any refund, return, rebate or the like of any Non-
Income Tax, including by filing any necessary exemption or other similar
forms, certificates or other similar documents. The Recipient shall promptly
reimburse the Provider for any unaffiliated third-party out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Provider or its Affiliates in connection with the Recipient
obtaining a refund or overpayment of refund, return, rebate or the like of any
Non-Income Tax. For the avoidance of doubt, any applicable income-based Taxes
measured by or imposed on the income of the Provider that are imposed
or assessed as a result of the provision of Services by the Provider shall be
borne by the Provider, unless the Provider is required by law to obtain
reimbursement of such Taxes from the Recipient.

 

(b) The Recipient shall be entitled to deduct and withhold Taxes required by
any applicable law to be withheld on payments made pursuant to this
Agreement. To the extent any amounts are so withheld, the Recipient shall (i)
pay, in addition to the amount otherwise due to the Provider under this
Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net
amount actually received by the Provider will equal the full amount the
Provider would have received had no such deduction or withholding been
required, (ii) pay when due such deducted and withheld amount to the proper
Governmental Authority and (iii) promptly provide to the Provider evidence of
such payment to such Governmental Authority. The Provider shall, prior to the
date of any payment to be made pursuant to this Agreement, at the request of
the Recipient, make commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Recipient
any certificate or other documentary evidence (x) required by applicable law
or (y) which the Provider is entitled by applicable law to provide in order to
reduce the amount of any Taxes that may be deducted or withheld from such
payment, and the Recipient agrees to accept and act in reliance on any such
duly and properly executed certificate or other applicable documentary
evidence.

 

(c) If the Provider (i) receives any refund (whether by payment, offset,
credit or otherwise) or (ii) utilizes any overpayment of Taxes that are borne
by Recipient pursuant to this Agreement, then the Provider shall promptly pay,
or cause to be paid, to the Recipient an amount equal to the deficiency or
excess, as the case may be, with respect to the amount that the Recipient has
borne if the amount of such refund or overpayment (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any interest or other amounts received with respect to
such refund or overpayment) had been included originally in the determination
of the amounts to be borne by Recipient pursuant to this Agreement, net of
any additional Taxes the Provider incurs or will incur as a result of the
receipt of such refund or such overpayment.

 

Section 4.03. _No Right to Set-Off_. Subject to Section 4.02(b), the Recipient
shall timely pay the full amount of Service Charges and Reimbursement Charges
and shall not set-off, counterclaim or otherwise withhold any amount owed to
the Provider under this Agreement on account of any obligation owed by the
Provider to the Recipient.

 



-13- ARTICLE V

 

STANDARD FOR SERVICE

 

Section 5.01. _Standard for Service_.

 

(a) The Provider agrees to perform the Services in a good and workman-like
manner, in compliance with all applicable Laws, and with substantially the
same nature, quality, standard of care and service levels at which the same or
similar services were performed by or on behalf of the Provider during the
one-year period prior to the Separation or, if not so previously
provided, then substantially similar to that which are applicable to similar
services provided to the Providers Affiliates or other business components.
Subject to Section 7.03, the Provider agrees to respond to any outage,
interruption or other failure of which it is aware of a Service in a manner
that is substantially similar to the manner in which such Provider or its
Affiliates responded to any outage, interruption or other failure of the same
or similar services during the one-year period prior to the Separation.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Provider to perform or cause
to be performed any Service to the extent the manner of such performance
would constitute a violation of applicable Law or any existing contract or
agreement with a third party. If the Provider is or becomes aware of any
potential violation on the part of the Provider, the Provider shall promptly
send a written notice to the Recipient of any such potential violation. The
Parties each agree to cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any necessary third-party consents required under any
existing contract or agreement with a third party to allow the Provider to
perform or cause to be performed any Service in accordance with the standards
set forth in this _Section 5.01_. Any out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by either Party in connection with obtaining any such third-party
consent that is required to allow the Provider to perform or cause to be
performed any Service shall be solely the responsibility of the Recipient. If,
with respect to a Service, the Parties, despite the use of such commercially
reasonable efforts, are unable to obtain a required third-party consent, or
the performance of such Service by the Provider would continue to constitute a
violation of applicable Laws, the Provider shall use commercially reasonable
efforts in good faith to provide such Services in a manner as closely as
possible to the standards described in this _Section 5.01_ that would apply
absent the exception provided for in the first sentence of this  _Section
5.01(b)_.

Section 5.02. _Disclaimer of Warranties_. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN
THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE SERVICES ARE
PROVIDED AS-IS, THAT EACH RECIPIENT ASSUMES ALL RISKS AND LIABILITY ARISING
FROM OR RELATING TO ITS USE OF AND RELIANCE UPON THE SERVICES, AND EACH
PROVIDER, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, MAKES NO
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT THERETO. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH
IN THIS AGREEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH
PROVIDER HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
REGARDING THE SERVICES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, EITHER IN FACT OR BY
OPERATION OF LAW, BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY IN REGARD TO QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, NONINFRINGEMENT, COMMERCIAL
UTILITY, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS OF ANY SERVICE FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

 



-14- Section 5.03. _Compliance with Laws and Regulations_. Each Party shall be
responsible for its own compliance and its subcontractors compliance with
any and all Laws applicable to its performance under this Agreement. No Party
will knowingly take any action in violation of any such applicable Law that
results in liability being imposed on the other Party.

ARTICLE VI

Affiliates or Representatives, whether in contract, tort (including
negligence and strict liability) or otherwise, at law or equity, for any
special, indirect, incidental, punitive or consequential damages whatsoever
(including lost profits or damages calculated on multiples of earnings
approaches), which in any way arise out of, relate to or are a consequence
of, its performance or nonperformance (or the performance or nonperformance of
any of its Affiliates, Representatives and any unaffiliated third-party

Agreement, including with respect to loss of profits, business interruptions
or claims of customers.

 

Section 6.02. _Limitation of Liability_. Except with respect to liabilities
arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct, the liabilities of each
Provider and its Affiliates and Representatives, collectively, under this
Agreement for any act or failure to act in connection herewith (including the
performance or breach of this Agreement), or from the sale,
delivery, provision or use of any Services provided under or contemplated by
this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence and strict
liability) or otherwise, at law or equity, shall not exceed the total
aggregate Service Charges (excluding any Reimbursement Charges) actually paid
to such Provider by the Recipient pursuant to this Agreement. The foregoing
limitations on liability in this _Section 6.02_ shall not apply to any breach
of _Section 8.03_ and shall not limit any obligation to re-perform as set
forth in Section 6.03. This _Section 6.02_ shall survive any termination of
this Agreement.

 

Section 6.03. _Obligation To Re-perform; Liabilities_. In the event of any
breach of this Agreement by any Provider with respect to the provision of any
Services (with respect to which the Provider can reasonably be expected to re-
perform in a commercially reasonable manner), the Provider shall (a) promptly
correct in all material respects such error, defect or breach or re-perform
in all material respects such Services in accordance with this Agreement at
the request of the Recipient and at the sole cost and expense of the Provider
and (b) subject to the limitations set forth in _Sections 6.01_ and  _6.02_ ,
reimburse the Recipient and its Affiliates and Representatives for damages
suffered by Recipient and its Affiliates that are attributable to such breach
by the Provider. The remedy set forth in this Section 6.03 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Recipient for any such breach of this
Agreement. Any request for re-performance in accordance with this _Section
6.03_ by the Recipient must be in writing and specify in reasonable detail the

 



-15-  particular error, defect or breach, and such request must be made no more
than one (1) month from the date such error, defect or breach becomes apparent
or should have reasonably become apparent to the Recipient. This Section 6.03
shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

Section 6.04. _Release and Recipient Indemnity_. Subject to Section 6.01,
each Recipient hereby releases the applicable Provider and its Affiliates and
Representatives (each, a "Provider Indemnified Party"), and each Recipient
hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each such Provider
Indemnified Party from and against any and all liabilities arising from,
relating to or in connection with: (a) the use of any Services by such
Recipient or any of its Affiliates, Representatives or other Persons using
such Services; or (b) the sale, delivery, provision or use of any Services
provided under or contemplated by this Agreement, in the case of each of
clause (a) and (b), except to the extent that such liabilities arise out
of, relate to or are a consequence of the applicable Provider Indemnified
Partys (i) bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct or (ii) breach
of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.05. _Provider Indemnity_. Subject to Section 6.01, each Provider
hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the applicable Recipient
and its Affiliates and Representatives (each, a "Recipient Indemnified
Party"), from and against any and all liabilities arising from, relating to or
in connection with: (a) the use of any Services by such Recipient or any of
its Affiliates, Representatives or other Persons using such Services; or (b)
the sale, delivery, provision or use of any Services provided under or
contemplated by this Agreement, in the case of each of clause (a) and (b), to

-16- ARTICLE VII

 

TERM AND TERMINATION

 

Section 7.01. _Term and Termination_. (a) This Agreement shall commence
immediately after the Effective Time and shall terminate upon the earlier to
occur of: (i) the last date on which either Party is obligated to provide any
Service to the other Party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or
(ii) the mutual written agreement of the Parties to terminate this Agreement
in its entirety.

(b) Either Party may terminate this Agreement in its entirety, or from time to
time with respect to the entirety of any individual Service, in its sole
discretion, in the event of any Change of Control of Entercom, upon providing
at least twenty (20) days prior written notice.

 

(c) Without prejudice to a Recipients rights with respect to a Force Majeure,
a Recipient may from time to time terminate this Agreement with respect to
the entirety of any individual Service but not a portion thereof:

(i) for any reason or no reason, upon providing at least sixty (60) days
prior written notice to the Provider; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Recipient shall pay to the Provider the necessary and reasonable documented
out-of-pocket costs incurred by Provider solely as a result of the early
termination of such Service other than any employee severance and relocation
expenses, but including sunken costs for the provision of the applicable
Service which cannot be recovered, non-terminable contractual
obligations under agreements used to provide such Service, any breakage or
termination fees and any other termination costs payable by the Provider with
respect to any resources or pursuant to any other third-party agreements that
were used by the Provider to provide such Service (or an equitably allocated
portion thereof, in the case of any such equipment, resources or agreements
that also were used for purposes other than providing Services); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Provider shall notify Recipient of all such costs prior to
termination, and Recipient is given the option of rescinding the termination
notice for a period of two (2) days following receipt of notice of such costs;
or

 

(ii) if the Provider of such Service has failed to perform any of its material
obligations under this Agreement with respect to such Service, and such
failure shall continue to exist twenty (20) days after receipt by the Provider
of written notice of such failure from the Recipient.

 

In the event that any Service is terminated other than at the end of a month,
the Service Charge associated with such Service shall be pro-
rated appropriately. The Parties acknowledge that there may be
interdependencies among the Services being provided under this Agreement that
may not be identified on the applicable Schedules and agree that, if the
Providers ability to provide a particular Service in accordance with this
Agreement is materially and adversely affected by the termination of another
Service in accordance with Section 7.01(c)(i) , then the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to amend the Schedule relating to such affected
continuing Service, which amendment shall be consistent with the terms of, and
the pricing methodology used for, comparable Services.

 



-17- (d) In connection with the termination of any Service, if the Recipient
reasonably determines that it will require such Service to continue beyond
the date on which such Service is scheduled to terminate, the Recipient may
extend such Service (any such extension, a " _Service Extension_ ") for a
specified period beyond the scheduled termination of such Service (which
period (i) shall in no event be longer than one (1) year and (ii) shall in no
event terminate later than two (2) years after the date of the Final
Distribution) by written notice to the Provider no less than thirty (30) days
prior to the date of such scheduled termination on the same terms and
conditions as such Service was provided prior to the Service Extension,
provided that the Parties agree to negotiate any changes to such terms or
conditions in good faith if so requested by a Party; provided, however; that
(i) there shall be no more than one (1) Service Extension with respect to each
Service and (ii) the Provider shall not be obligated to provide such Service
Extension if a third-party consent is required and cannot be obtained by the
Provider. Unless otherwise agreed to by Provider and Recipient, for the first
ninety (90) days of a Service Extension, the Service Charge applicable to any
such Service Extension shall be one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the
Service Charge applicable to such Service immediately prior to the Service
Extension and after the first ninety (90) days of a Service Extension, the
Service Charge applicable to any such Service Extension shall be one hundred
and twenty percent (120%) of the Service Charge applicable to such Service
immediately prior to the Service Extension; provided, however, that there
shall be no increase in Service Charges for any Service Extension if the
failure of the Recipient to achieve a timely Cutover with respect to such
Service resulted from the Providers breach of Section 3.03. In connection
with any request for Service Extensions in accordance with this Section
7.01(d), the CBS Services Manager and the Radio Services Manager shall in good
faith (x) negotiate the terms of an amendment to the applicable Schedule,
which amendment shall be consistent with the terms of the applicable Service,
and (y) determine the costs and expenses (other than Service Charges), if any,
that would be incurred by the Provider or the Recipient, as the case may be,
in connection with the provision of such Service Extension, which costs and
expenses shall be borne solely by the Party requesting the Service Extension.
Each amended Schedule to implement a Service Extension, as agreed to in
writing by the Parties, shall be deemed part of this Agreement as of the date
of such agreement and any Services provided pursuant to such Service
Extensions shall be deemed "Services" provided under this Agreement, in each
case subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 7.02. _Effect of Termination_. Upon termination of any Service
pursuant to this Agreement, the Provider of the terminated Service will have
no further obligation to provide the terminated Service, and the relevant
Recipient will have no obligation to pay any future Service Charges relating
to any such Service; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Recipient shall
remain obligated to the relevant Provider for the (i) Service Charges and
Reimbursement Charges owed and payable in respect of Services provided prior
to the effective date of termination and (ii) any applicable charges described
in Section 7.01(c)(i), which charges shall be payable only in the event that
the Recipient terminates any Service pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(i). In
connection with the termination of any Service, the provisions of this
Agreement not relating solely to such terminated Service shall survive any
such termination, and in connection with a termination of this Agreement,
_Article I_ , _Article VI_ (including liability in respect of any
indemnifiable liabilities under this Agreement arising or occurring on or
prior to the date of termination), _Article VII_ , _Article VIII_ and all
confidentiality obligations under this Agreement and liability for all due and
unpaid Service Charges and Reimbursement Charges and any applicable charges
payable pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(i), shall continue to survive
indefinitely. For the avoidance of doubt, termination of any Service pursuant
to this Agreement will not affect the rights and obligations of the Parties
with respect to any Common Agreements under the Separation Agreement.

 



-18- Section 7.03. _Force Majeure_. (a) Neither Party (nor any Person acting on its
behalf) shall have any liability or responsibility for failure to fulfill any
obligation (other than a payment obligation) under this Agreement so long as
and to the extent to which the fulfillment of such obligation is prevented,
frustrated, hindered or delayed as a consequence of a Force Majeure;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) such Party (or such Person) shall have
exercised commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the effect of such Force
Majeure on its obligations and, to the extent and as soon as possible and
commercially reasonable, to remove such Force Majeure; and (ii) the nature,
quality and standard of care that the Provider shall provide in delivering a
Service after a Force Majeure shall be substantially the same as the nature,
quality and standard of care that the Provider provides to its Affiliates with
respect to such Service. In the event of an occurrence of a Force Majeure, the
Party whose performance is affected thereby shall give notice of suspension
as soon as reasonably practicable to the other stating the date and extent of
such suspension and the cause thereof, and such Party shall resume the
performance of such obligations as soon as reasonably practicable after the
removal of such cause.

(b) During the period of a Force Majeure, the Recipient shall be entitled to
permanently terminate such Service(s) (and shall be relieved of the
obligation to pay Service Charges for such Services(s) throughout the duration
of such Force Majeure) if a Force Majeure shall continue to exist for more
than fifteen (15) consecutive days, it being understood that Recipient shall
not be required to provide any advance notice of such termination to Provider
or pay any charges in connection therewith.

ARTICLE VIII

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

Section 8.01. _No Agency_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed in any
way or for any purpose to constitute any Party as an agent of an unaffiliated
party in the conduct of such other partys business. A Provider of any Service
under this Agreement shall act as an independent contractor and not as the
agent of the Recipient in performing such Service, maintaining control over
its employees, its subcontractors and their employees and complying with all
withholding of income at source requirements, whether federal, national,
state, local or foreign.

 

Section 8.02. _Subcontractors_. A Provider may hire or engage one or more
subcontractors to perform any or all of its obligations under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) such Provider shall use the same degree of
care in selecting any such subcontractor as it would if such contractor was
being retained to provide similar services to the Provider and (ii) such
Provider shall in all cases remain primarily responsible for all of its
obligations under this Agreement with respect to the scope of the Services,
the standard for services as set forth in _Article V_ and the content of
the Services provided to the Recipient.

 



-19- Section 8.03. _Treatment of Confidential Information_.

 

(a) The Parties shall not, and shall cause all other Persons providing
Services or having access to information of the other Party that
is confidential or proprietary (" _Confidential Information_ ") not to,
disclose to any other Person or use, except for purposes of this Agreement,
any Confidential Information of the other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Confidential Information may be used by such Party to the extent that
such Confidential Information has been (i) in the public domain through no
fault of such Party or any member of such Group or any of their respective
Representatives, (ii) later lawfully acquired from other sources by such
Party (or any member of such Partys Group) which sources are not themselves
bound by a confidentiality obligation, or (iii) independently generated
without reference to any Confidential Information of the other Party;
_provided_ , _further_ , that each Party may disclose Confidential Information
of the other Party, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law: (i) to its
Representatives on a need-to-know basis in connection with the performance of
such Partys obligations under this Agreement; (ii) in any report, statement,
testimony or other submission required to be made to any Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction over the disclosing Party; or (iii) in order to
comply with applicable Law, or in response to any summons, subpoena or other
legal process or formal or informal investigative demand issued to the
disclosing Party in the course of any litigation, investigation or
administrative proceeding. In the event that a Party becomes legally compelled
(based on advice of counsel) by deposition, interrogatory, request for
documents subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar judicial
or administrative process to disclose any Confidential Information of the
other Party, such disclosing Party shall provide the other Party with prompt
prior written notice of such requirement, and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, cooperate with the other Party (at such other Partys expense)
to obtain a protective order or similar remedy to cause such Confidential
Information not to be disclosed, including interposing all available
objections thereto, such as objections based on settlement privilege. In the
event that such protective order or other similar remedy is not obtained, the
disclosing Party shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential
Information that has been legally compelled, and shall exercise
its commercially reasonable efforts (at such other Partys expense) to obtain
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential
Information.

 

(b) Each Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, protect the
Confidential Information of the other Party by using the same degree of care
to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of such as the Party uses to protect
its own confidential information of a like nature, but in any event no less
than a reasonable degree of care.

 

(c) Each Party shall be liable for any failure by its respective
Representatives to comply with the restrictions on use and disclosure
of Confidential Information contained in this Agreement.

(d) Each Party shall comply with all applicable local, state, national,
federal and foreign privacy and data protection Laws that are or that may in
the future be applicable to the provision of Services under this Agreement.

 

Section 8.04. _Further Assurances_. Each Party covenants and agrees that,
without any additional consideration, it shall execute and deliver any
further legal instruments and perform any acts that are or may become
necessary to effectuate this Agreement.

 



-20- Section 8.05. _Dispute Resolution_. Any Dispute shall be resolved in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Article VII_ of the Separation
Agreement, which shall be the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution
of any such Dispute unless otherwise specified herein or in _Article VII_ of
the Separation Agreement. 

Section 8.06. _Notices_. Except with respect to routine communications by the
CBS Services Manager, Radio Services Manager, CBS Local Services Manager and
Radio Local Service Manager under _Section 2.06_, all notices, requests,
claims, demands and other communications under this Agreement shall be in

parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

 

1\. _Certain Definitions_. As used in this Agreement, the following terms have
the following respective meanings:

 

a. " _501(c) Organization_ " shall mean an entity that is exempt from taxation
under Section 501(c)(3), Section 501(c)(4) or Section 501(c)(9) of the United

with respect to such successors exemption is issued before, at or after the
conversion date).

 

c. " _Conversion Event_ " shall mean such time at which the Field Family
Members collectively own, beneficially and of record, less than 3,000,000

(iii) all Transfers of Capital Stock to any Exclusively Owned Entity

any, that such Exclusively Owned Entity becomes a Non-Qualifying Entity);

 

(iv) all Transfers of Capital Stock to (A) the personal representative of a
Field Family Member upon the death of such Field Family Member, solely to the
extent the executor or administrator is acting in the capacity as personal
representative of the estate of the Field Family Member or (B) the trustee of
a testamentary trust of a Field Family Member upon the death of such Field

Agreement unless such Transfer would qualify for another exemption from the
definition of "Transfer" at such time;

convert, or cause to be converted, at the Effective Time, an aggregate of
3,152,333 shares of Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock in accordance
with the provisions for voluntary conversion of Class B Common Stock in
Section 10(e)(i) of the Articles.

3\. _Transfer Restriction_. Each Holder agrees that, except for Permitted
Transfers, it will not, and it will cause its Permitted Transferees not to,
Transfer any Capital Stock, to the extent received pursuant to a Permitted
Transfer from such Holder after the date hereof, for a period of nine (9)
months after the Effective Date.

4\. _Mandatory Conversion_. Upon the occurrence of a Conversion Event, each
Holder shall, as soon as is practicable (and in any event prior to any
subsequent opportunity to vote such Class B Common Stock), take such actions
as are required to convert all of such Holders Class B Common Stock to Class
A Common Stock in accordance with the provisions for voluntary conversion of
Class B Common Stock in Section 10(e)(i) of the Articles, including delivering
to the Company (a) the certificate or certificates representing each of such
Holders shares of Class B Common Stock, duly endorsed in blank or
accompanied by duly executed proper instruments of transfer, and (b) written
notice to the Company stating that such Holder elects to convert all of such
Holders shares of Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock and stating
the name and address in which each certificate for shares of Class A Common
Stock issued upon such conversion is to be issued.

 

5\. _Agreement Regarding Remaining Class_ __ _ B Common Stock_. From and
after the occurrence of a Conversion Event, no Management Shareholders shall
accept any shareholders proxy (or give effect to any existing proxy) to vote
(in person, by proxy or otherwise) such shareholders Class B Common Stock
outstanding. Further, to the extent a Management Shareholder acquires any
Class B Common Stock after the occurrence of a Conversion Event, such
Management Shareholder shall, as soon as is practicable (and in any event
prior to any subsequent opportunity to vote such Class B Common Stock),
convert such Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock in accordance with
the provisions for voluntary conversion of Class B Common Stock in Section
10(e)(i) of the Articles.

 



4 6\. _Class B Conversions_. The conversion of the shares of Class B Common
Stock hereunder shall be deemed to be effective as of the date as of which
the conversion is recorded on the books of the Company. The Company shall
cause the transfer agent to deliver a certificate or certificates for the
Class A Common Stock as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
conversion has been recorded on the books of the Company.

7\. _Company Sale and Equal Status_. After the Effective Time, to the extent
that any transaction is, or series of related transactions are, (a) a
consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other entity, or any
other transaction having an effect on shareholders substantially similar to
that resulting from a consolidation or merger, or an acquisition of all or
substantially all of the Companys assets or (b) any tender or exchange offer
by any third party to acquire (i) a majority of the aggregate Voting Control
of the Capital Stock, (ii) shares of Class A Common Stock or (iii) shares of
Capital Stock (any such transaction, a " _Company Sale or Recapitalization_
"), no Holder shall sell, transfer or exchange, directly or indirectly, any
shares of Capital Stock in, or in a transaction related to, such Company Sale
or Recapitalization, for an amount per share greater than that received in
such Company Sale or Recapitalization by the holders of Class A Common Stock
or a form of consideration different from the form that holders of Class A
Common Stock would receive, or may elect to receive, in such Company Sale or
Recapitalization; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such consideration
consists, in whole or in part, of shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, the Company or any other corporation, partnership, limited
liability company or other entity, then the powers, designations, preferences
and relative, common, participating, optional or other special rights and
qualifications, limitations and restrictions of such shares of capital stock
or other equity interests may differ to the extent that the powers,
designations, preferences and relative, common, participating, optional or
other special rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the
Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock differ as provided in the
Articles (including, without limitation, with respect to the voting rights
and conversion provisions thereof) (such differences, the " _Class_ __ _
Differences_"); _provided_ , _further_ , that, if the Field Family is granted
the right to elect to receive one of two or more alternative forms of
consideration, the foregoing provision shall be deemed satisfied if holders of
Class A Common Stock are granted identical election rights; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that this  _Section_ __ _ 7_ shall not prohibit any employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement, or payments
made or to be made or benefits granted or to be granted according to such an
arrangement, with respect to any Holder, in connection with any such
transaction, if the arrangement would satisfy the requirements of the non-
exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (assuming for such purposes that the
applicable transaction were subject to such rule).

 

8\. _Specific Enforcement_. Each party hereto agrees that its obligations
hereunder are necessary and reasonable in order to protect the other parties
to this Agreement, and each party expressly agrees and understands that
monetary damages would inadequately compensate an injured party for the breach
of this Agreement by any party, that this Agreement shall be
specifically enforceable, and that, in addition to any other remedies that
may be available at law, in equity or otherwise, any breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement shall be the proper subject of a temporary or
permanent injunction or restraining order, without the necessity of proving
actual damages. Further, each party hereto waives any claim or defense that
there is an adequate remedy at law for such breach or threatened breach.

 



5 9\. _Covenants of the Company_. The Company agrees to use reasonable
commercial efforts, within the requirements of applicable law, to ensure that
the rights granted hereunder are effective and that the parties hereto enjoy
the benefits thereof.

 

10\. _Administration of this Agreement_. The Company shall establish, from
time to time, such policies and procedures relating to the general
administration of the terms of this Agreement and any Transfers of Capital
Stock hereunder, as it may deem necessary or advisable consistent with the
terms of this Agreement, and shall deliver notice to the Field Family of the
restrictions placed on their shares of Capital Stock by this Agreement in
accordance with the requirements of the Business Corporation Law of
Pennsylvania.

 

11\. _Scope of this Agreement_. The Field Family intends that this Agreement
shall constitute an amendment, modification, supplement and/or waiver of
certain rights, preferences, privileges, terms or provisions set forth or
contained in the Articles.

12\. _Inconsistent Agreements_. Each Holder agrees that it has not entered
into, and will not enter into, any agreement, understanding or arrangement
that is inconsistent with this Agreement or that would preclude such Holder
from complying with its obligations under this Agreement. In the event of any
inconsistency between this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Separation
Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or any of the Transaction
Agreements (as defined in the Merger Agreement) relating to the transactions
contemplated by such agreements, with respect to the subject matter hereof,
the provisions of this Agreement shall control.

 

13\. _Term and Termination_.

 

a. This Agreement shall become of force and effect only upon the occurrence of
the Effective Date.

 

b. This Agreement will terminate (i) without further action at any time before
the Effective Date upon termination of the Merger Agreement or (ii) upon
conversion of all of the outstanding Class B Common Stock.

c. This Agreement may be terminated by the written consent of the parties
hereto, _provided_ that such termination has been approved by a majority of
the Independent Directors (other than any Field Family Members or any of their
affiliates).

 

d. If this Agreement is terminated, no party hereto will have any liability of
any kind to the other parties hereto or any other Person on account of this
Agreement, except as provided in the Merger Agreement.

14\. _Miscellaneous_.

 

a. _Successors and Assigns_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or transferred (whether
by operation of law or

 



6  otherwise) by the Company, on the one hand, or any Holder, on the other
hand, without the prior written consent of the Company, and any purported
assignment or other transfer without such consent shall be void and
unenforceable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may assign or
transfer this Agreement to any successor entity that has organizational
documents containing terms regarding the rights of its different classes
of ownership substantially similar to the Class Differences in connection
with any merger, consolidation, reorganization or business combination
transaction. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Company and
the Field Family and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any person other
than the Company and the Field Family or their respective successors and
assigns any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

b. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the full and entire
understanding and agreement among the Company and the Field Family with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

waived, amended, modified or supplemented only by a written instrument that
has been executed by the Company, that has been approved by a majority of the
Independent Directors (other than any Field Family Members or any of their
affiliates) and has been approved in writing by any Holder who would be
adversely effected by such waiver, amendment, modification or supplement. Any
failure of any party hereto to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition in this Agreement may be waived by the party entitled to the
benefit thereof only by a written instrument that has been signed by the party
granting such waiver and that, in the case of the Company, has been approved
by a majority of the Independent Directors (other than any of Field Family
Members or any of their affiliates). No delay on the part of any party hereto
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party of any right,
power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver of any other right, power or
privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.

d. _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications under
this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly
given or made as follows: (i) if sent by registered or certified mail in the

interpretation, negotiation, validity, enforceability or performance of this

application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto

court in any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the interpretation, negotiation, validity, enforceability or
performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute, claim or
controversy may be heard and determined in such Delaware state or federal

such Action. The parties hereto further agree, to the extent permitted by law,
that any final and nonappealable judgment against any of them in any dispute,
claim or controversy contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit
on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the

APPLICABLE LAW) TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY

THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN. NO PARTY HERETO SHALL SEEK A JURY TRIAL
IN ANY LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER LITIGATION PROCEDURE

OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR
INSTRUMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET
FORTH ABOVE IN THIS _SECTION 13.e_. NO PARTY HERETO HAS IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH
OR REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS _SECTION
13.e_ WILL NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES.

f. _Equitable Remedies_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that the
other parties hereto would be irreparably damaged in the event that any of the
terms or provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Therefore,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each
party hereto hereby agrees that the other parties hereto shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement,

 



8  and to enforce specifically the performance by such first party hereto under
this Agreement, and each party hereto hereby agrees to waive the defense in
any such suit that each of the other parties hereto has an adequate remedy at
law and to interpose no opposition, legal or otherwise, as to the propriety of
injunction or specific performance as a remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any
requirement to post any bond in connection with obtaining such relief. The
equitable remedies described in this _Section 13.f_ shall be in addition to,
and not in lieu of, any other remedies at law or in equity that the parties
hereto may elect to pursue. The rights and remedies provided for in this
Agreement are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies
which the parties hereto may have hereunder or may otherwise have at law or in
equity.

 

g. _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the terms or
provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this
Agreement so long as the absence of such terms or provisions does not
materially adversely affect any party hereto, and the parties hereto shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to substitute one or more valid,
legal and enforceable terms or provisions into this Agreement which, insofar
as practicable, implement the purposes and intent of this Agreement and which
are not materially adverse to any party hereto. Any term or provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part, degree or within certain
jurisdictions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent not held
invalid or unenforceable to the extent consistent with the intent of the
parties hereto as reflected by this Agreement and not materially adverse to
any party hereto. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each party
hereto waives any term or provision of law which renders any term or provision
of this Agreement to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect.

 

h. _Several Liability_. The obligations of each Holder under this Agreement
are several and not joint, and no Holder shall have any liability or
obligation under this Agreement for any breach hereunder by any other Holder.
Each Holder is signing and entering this Agreement solely in his, her or its
capacity as the beneficial owner of such Holders shares of Capital
Stock. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Holder
makes any agreement or understanding in this Agreement in such Holders
capacity as an employee, officer or director of the Company, and nothing
herein (i) shall limit or affect in any way any actions that may hereafter be
taken by him, her or it in his, her or its capacity as an employee, officer or
director of the Company, including in exercising rights under the Merger
Agreement, and no such actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this
Agreement or (ii) shall be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict him, her
or it from exercising his, her or its fiduciary duties as an employee, officer
or director to the Company or its stockholders.

i. _Interpretation_. The Section headings in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect the
meaning or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. The parties
hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement and have been advised by counsel in connection therewith. In the
event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises with respect
to any term or provision of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party hereto by virtue of the
authorship of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement. For all
purposes of and under this Agreement, (i) the word "including" shall be deemed
to be 

 



9  immediately followed by the words "without limitation"; (ii) words
(including defined terms) in the singular shall be deemed to include the
plural and vice versa; (iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereto,"
"herewith" and any other words of similar import shall, unless otherwise
stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular term or provision of this Agreement, unless otherwise specified
and (iv) the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders;
the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the
neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine genders.

j. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts
(including by facsimile or electronic signature and by electronic mail or
PDF), each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all
of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

k. _Due Authority_. Each party hereto hereby represents and warrants to the
other parties as follows:

 

Such party has the full power and authority to make, enter into and carry out
the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by such party and constitutes a valid and binding

VOTING AGREEMENT

This VOTING AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), is dated as of February 2, 2017
by and between Entercom Communications Corp., a Pennsylvania corporation (the
" _Company_ ") and the shareholder of the Company listed on signature page
hereto (the " _Shareholder_ "). Capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the
Merger Agreement (as defined below).

 

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, CBS Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _CBS_ "), and CBS Radio
Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of CBS (" _Radio_
"), the Company and Constitution Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (" _Merger Sub_ ") will enter into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), providing for,
among other things, the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Merger Sub with and into
Radio, with Radio surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, CBS and Radio will enter into a Separation Agreement (the "
_Separation Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, among other things, prior to or
on the Distribution Date, (a) CBS Broadcasting Inc. will distribute all of the
outstanding equity of Radio to Westinghouse CBS Holding Company, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Westinghouse_ ") (the " _First Distribution_ "); (b)
Westinghouse will distribute all of the outstanding equity of Radio to CBS
(the " _Second Distribution_ " and, together with the First Distribution, the
" _Internal Distributions_ "); and (c) Radio shall effect the Stock Split (as
defined in the Separation Agreement) (together with the
Internal Distributions, the " _Radio Reorganization_ "), in each case on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the
Separation Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Separation Agreement, following the consummation of
the Internal Distributions, on the Distribution Date, (i) CBS will consummate
an offer to exchange (the " _Exchange Offer_ ") all of the outstanding shares
of Radio Common Stock for shares of CBS Class B Common Stock, par value $0.001
per share ("CBS Class B Common Stock") then outstanding and (ii) in the event
that holders of CBS Class B Common Stock subscribe for less than all of the
shares of Radio Common Stock in the Exchange Offer, CBS will distribute the
remaining outstanding shares of Radio Common Stock on a _pro_ _rata_ basis to
holders of CBS Common Stock whose shares of CBS Common Stock remain
outstanding after consummation of the Exchange Offer, so that CBS will be
treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as having distributed all of the
Radio Common Stock to its stockholders (the " _Clean-Up Spin-Off_"),
considering, for the purposes of calculating the  _pro_ _rata_ distribution
of Radio Common Stock pursuant to any Clean-Up Spin-Off, the CBS Class A
Common Stock and CBS Class B Common Stock as a single class (collectively,
the " _Final Distribution_ " and together with the Internal Distributions, the
" _Distributions_ "), in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and the Separation Agreement

WHEREAS, it is proposed that upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement, following the consummation of the Final
Distribution, Merger Sub will merge with and into Radio in the Merger, with
Radio surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and in which
Merger all outstanding shares of Radio Common Stock will be   converted into shares of the Companys Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01
per share, (the " _Company Class_ __ _ A Common Stock_"), on the terms
and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, such that former
holders of CBS Class B Common Stock will hold approximately 72% of the
Companys common stock on a fully-diluted basis following the Merger;

 

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Shareholder is the record owner of the
Companys Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, (the " _Company
Class_ __ _ B Common Stock_") set forth on Schedule I;

WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement requires (i) the affirmative approval by a
majority of the aggregate voting power represented by the Acquiror Common
Stock, voting as a single class, to approve the issuance of the Company Class
A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger (the " _Issuance Approval_ ") and (ii)
the affirmative approval by a majority of the aggregate voting power
represented by the Acquiror Common Stock, voting as a single class, to approve
amendments to the Acquiror Charter in order to provide that the Acquiror
Board shall be classified, effective as of the Effective Time (the "
_Amendment Approval_ " and, together with the Issuance Approval, the "
_Company Shareholder Approvals_ ").

 

WHEREAS, as a condition to the Parties entry into and performance of their

make, enter into and carry out the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Shareholder and
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Shareholder enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability
may be limited by the effect of applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,

rights generally and the effect of general principles of equity, regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at Law or in
equity.

3.2. _Ownership of the Company Common Stock_. As of the date hereof, the
Shareholder (i) is the record owner of the Company Class B Common Stock

3.3. _No Conflict: Consents_.

 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Shareholder does not,
and the performance by the Shareholder of the obligations under this
Agreement and the compliance by the Shareholder with any provisions hereof do
not and will not: (i) conflict with or violate in any material respect any
Laws applicable to the Shareholder, or (ii) result in any material breach of
or constitute a material default (or an event that with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a material default) under, or give to others any
rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result
in the creation of a Lien on any of the Company Class B Common Stock owned by
the Shareholder and set forth on Schedule I pursuant to, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or
other instrument or obligation to which the Shareholder is a party or by
which the Shareholder is bound.

(b) No material consent, approval, order or authorization of,
or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority or
any other Person, is required in order for the Shareholder to execute and
deliver this Agreement or perform its obligations hereunder, except as
amendments to the Shareholders filings on Schedule 13D as required by the
rules and regulations of the Exchange Act.

3.4. _Absence of Litigation_. There is no action, suit, proceeding or, to the
Shareholders actual knowledge, investigation (whether judicial, arbitral,
administrative or other) (each an " _Action_ ") pending against, or, to the

Shareholder that could reasonably be expected to materially impair or
materially adversely affect the ability of the Shareholder to perform the
Shareholders obligations hereunder.

 

4\. _Notice of Certain Events_. The Shareholder shall notify the Company
promptly of the receipt by the Shareholder of any notice or
other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person

affect the remedies available to any party.

5\. _Termination_.

 

5.1. This Agreement, and all obligations, terms and conditions contained
herein, shall automatically terminate in its entirety (a) without any further
action required by any Person immediately following the Effective Time and (b)
by the mutual written consent of the parties hereto, _provided_ that any such
termination pursuant to this clause (b) shall have been approved by a
majority of the Independent Directors (other than the Shareholder, any of his
family members or any of their affiliates). For purposes of this Agreement,
"Independent Director" shall have the meaning set forth in the Companys
amended and restated articles of incorporation.

 



-4- 5.2. This Agreement, and all obligations, terms and conditions contained
herein, shall automatically terminate without any further action required by
any Person, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement; _provided_ , that,
Sections 1 and 2.1 and 2.2 shall each survive until twelve (12) months after
the date of the termination of the Merger Agreement, unless the Merger
Agreement is terminated (a) pursuant to Section 9.1(a) of the Merger Agreement
or (b) by CBS or the Company (as applicable) (i) pursuant to Section 9.1(b) of
the Merger Agreement, unless (A) the Companys failure to perform or observe
in any material respect any covenant, obligation or other agreement contained
in the Merger Agreement has been the primary cause of, or has resulted in, the
failure of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(c) of
the Merger Agreement to be satisfied or (B) the Acquiror Shareholder Approvals
have not been obtained at the time of such termination and an Acquiror
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or otherwise made publicly
known and not withdrawn prior to such termination, (ii) pursuant to Section
9.1(d) of the Merger Agreement, (iii) pursuant to Section 9.1(h) of the Merger
Agreement, unless the Companys failure to comply with Section 7.9 of the
Merger Agreement is the primary cause of the action or inaction permitting
termination pursuant to Section 9.1(h ) of the Merger Agreement, or (iv)
pursuant to Section 9.1(i) of the Merger Agreement, unless the Companys
failure to comply with Section 7.9 is the primary cause of the action or
inaction permitting termination pursuant to Section 9.1(i).

 

5.3. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Sections 5.1 or 5.2, this Agreement or any part hereof (as
applicable) shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part
of any party hereto; _provided_ that no such termination shall relieve any
party hereto from any liability for any breach of this Agreement occurring
prior to such termination and the provisions of this Section 5 and Section 6
shall survive any such termination.

6.  _Miscellaneous_.

6.1. _Severability_. If any provision (or part thereof) of this Agreement, or
the application of any provision (or part thereof) to any Person or
circumstance, shall be declared judicially to be invalid, unenforceable or
void, such decision shall not have the effect of invalidating or voiding the
remainder of this Agreement, it being the intent and agreement of the parties
hereto that this Agreement shall be deemed amended by modifying such provision
(or part thereof) to the extent necessary to render it valid, legal and
enforceable while preserving its intent or, if such modification is not
possible, by substituting therefor another provision that is legal and
enforceable and that achieves the same objective.

6.2. _Binding Effect and Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This
Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall also be binding upon any
Person to whom the Shareholder Transfers the Subject Shares (including by
bequest).

6.3. _Amendments and Modifications_. This Agreement may not be modified,
amended, altered or supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a
written agreement executed

 



-5-  by the parties hereto, _provided_ that any modification, amendment,
alteration or supplement (or waiver of any of the terms) of this Agreement
must be approved by a majority of the Independent Directors (other than the
Shareholder, any of his family members or any of their affiliates).

6.4. _Specific Performance_. In the event of any actual or threatened default
in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement, the party hereto who is thereby aggrieved will have the right to
specific performance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
injunctive or other equitable relief in respect of its rights under this
Agreement, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies at law or in
equity. The parties hereto agree that the remedies at law for any breach or
threatened breach, including monetary damages, are inadequate compensation for
any loss and that any defense in any Action for specific performance that a
remedy at law would be adequate is waived. Any requirements for the securing
or posting of any bond with such remedy are waived by each of the parties to
this Agreement.

6.5. _Notices_. All notices and other communications to be given to any party
hereunder shall be sufficiently given for all purposes hereunder if in writing
and delivered by hand, courier or overnight delivery service or three (3) days
after being mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested,
with appropriate postage prepaid, or when received in the form of a facsimile
and shall be directed to the address set forth below (or at such other address
