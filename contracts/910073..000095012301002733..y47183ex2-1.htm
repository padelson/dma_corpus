   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of March 27, 2001, (this "Plan"), by and between New York Community Bancorp, Inc. ("NYCB") and Richmond County Financial Corp. ("RCF").   RECITALS   A. NYCB. NYCB is a Delaware corporation with its principal executive offices located in Westbury, New York. As of the date hereof, NYCB has (i) 60,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("NYCB Common Stock"), of which not more than 28,971,798 shares are outstanding, together with the preferred share purchase rights ("NYCB Stockholder Rights") issued pursuant to the Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement, dated as of January 16, 1996, between NYCB and Mellon Investor Services, L.L.C., as Rights Agent, ("NYCB Rights Agreement"), and (ii) 5,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("NYCB Preferred Stock"), of which 100,000 shares have been designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, without par value ("NYCB Preferred Stock Series A"), of which no shares are outstanding.   B. RCF. RCF is a Delaware corporation with its principal executive offices located in Staten Island, New York. As of the date hereof, RCF has (i) 75,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("RCF Common Stock"), of which not more than 26,540,535 shares are outstanding, and (ii) 5,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("RCF Preferred Stock"), of which no shares are outstanding.   C. The Stock Option Agreements. As an inducement and condition to NYCB\'s entering into this Plan, RCF is granting to NYCB an option pursuant to a stock option agreement substantially in the form of Annex A to this Plan (the "RCF Stock Option Agreement"). As an inducement and condition to RCF\'s entering into this Plan, NYCB is granting to RCF an option pursuant to a stock option agreement substantially in the form of Annex A to this Plan (the "NYCB Stock Option Agreement" and, together with the RCF Stock Option Agreement, the "Stock Option Agreements").   D. Intention of the Parties. Each of the parties to this Plan intends that the Merger (as hereinafter defined) shall qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code") and that this Plan shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code.   E. Approvals. The Board of Directors of each of NYCB and RCF has (i) determined that this Plan and the transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of NYCB and RCF, respectively, and in the best interests of their respective shareholders, (ii) determined that this Plan and the transactions contemplated hereby are consistent with, and in furtherance   

    of, its respective business strategies and (iii) authorized and approved this Plan and its respective Stock Option Agreement.   F. Employment and Noncompetition Agreements. Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Plan, NYCB and RCF are entering into employment agreements and noncompetition agreements with each of Michael F. Manzulli, Anthony E. Burke and Thomas R. Cangemi, substantially in the form of Annexes B, C and D to this Plan, respectively.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of their mutual promises and obligations, the parties hereto approve, adopt and make this Plan and prescribe the terms and conditions hereof and the manner and basis of carrying it into effect, which are as follows:    ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), RCF shall merge with and into NYCB (the "Merger"), and the separate corporate existence of RCF shall thereupon cease. NYCB shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. Upon their mutual agreement and without additional approval of their respective Boards of Directors, RCF and NYCB may at any time prior to the Effective Time change the method of effecting the combination of RCF and NYCB (including the provisions of this Article I) if and to the extent they both deem such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable, including, without limitation, a merger of either party with a wholly owned subsidiary of the other; provided, however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the Exchange Ratio (as hereinafter defined), (ii) adversely affect the tax treatment of NYCB\'s shareholders or RCF\'s shareholders pursuant to this Plan, (iii) adversely affect the tax treatment of RCF or NYCB or (iv) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Plan. The parties agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this Plan executed by both parties.   (b) The Merger shall have the effects specified in this Plan and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL").   1.2 Effective Time. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan, on the Closing Date, NYCB will cause a certificate of merger to be filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger"). The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been filed, or at such other time as may be specified therein. The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the "Effective Time."    2  

      (b) NYCB and RCF each will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Effective Time to occur on last day of the month in which the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions specified in Sections 7.1(a), (b), (c) and (e) of this Plan has occurred; provided, however, that if the Effective Time would occur less than three business days after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions described above, NYCB and RCF will cause the Effective Time to occur on the last day of the immediately following month. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.2(b), NYCB and RCF may cause the Effective Time to occur on such earlier or later day following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions as they may agree, consistent with the provisions of the DGCL.   1.3 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at such time and place as NYCB and RCF shall agree, on the date when the Effective Time is to occur (the "Closing Date").   1.4 Bank Merger. NYCB and RCF shall take all action necessary and appropriate to cause, including causing the entering into a merger agreement, their respective subsidiaries Queens County Savings Bank ("NYCB Bank") and Richmond County Savings Bank ("RCF Bank") to merge (the "Bank Merger") simultaneously with or, if such Bank Merger cannot be effected simultaneously, immediately after the consummation of the Merger, with NYCB Bank being the surviving bank ("Surviving Bank") thereof pursuant to the provisions of applicable law. At the effective time of the Bank Merger, the Certificate of Organization and by-laws of the Surviving Bank shall be the Certificate of Organization and by-laws of NYCB Bank in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the Bank Merger.    ARTICLE II  GOVERNING DOCUMENTS OF THE  SURVIVING CORPORATION   2.1 Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of NYCB, as then in effect, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation except that, if the number of shares of authorized NYCB Common Stock shall not have been increased to 150,000,000, the number of shares of authorized NYCB Common Stock shall be increased to 150,000,000.   2.2 Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of NYCB, as then in effect, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, after giving effect to the amendment thereto effected by the NYCB Board of Directors set forth in Annex E.   2.3 Headquarters of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the corporate headquarters of the Surviving Corporation shall be Westbury, New York.    3  

     2.4 Name of the Surviving Corporation. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be New York Community Bancorp, Inc.    ARTICLE III  DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS   3.1 Directors of the Surviving Corporation. (a) At the Effective Time, the directors of the Surviving Corporation shall consist of nine (9) members, five (5) of whom shall be selected by the Chief Executive Officer of NYCB prior to the Effective Time ("NYCB Directors") and four (4) of whom shall be selected by the Chief Executive Officer of RCF prior to the Effective Time ("RCF Directors") and which shall be allocated among the three classes of directors of the Surviving Corporation by the agreement of the Chief Executive Officers of RCF and NYCB so that each class shall have at least one NYCB Director and one RCF Director. The NYCB Directors shall include the Chief Executive Officer of NYCB as of the date of this Plan ("NYCB Chief Executive Officer") and the RCF Directors shall include the Chief Executive Officer of RCF as of the date of this Plan ("RCF Chief Executive Officer").   (b) After the Effective Time until the annual meeting of shareholders of the Surviving Corporation in 2004, unless two-thirds of all of the directors of the Surviving Corporation shall otherwise determine, in the event that a NYCB Director or a RCF Director or a director otherwise elected or nominated by the NYCB Directors or the RCF Directors as set forth herein shall resign, no longer be able to serve or not stand or be standing for reelection (for whatever reason), (i) if such director shall be a NYCB Director or a nominee of the NYCB Directors, then the NYCB Directors and nominees of the NYCB Directors serving as directors shall have the exclusive right to nominate an individual to fill such vacancy and the entire Board of Directors shall either elect such person a director or, if appropriate, nominate such person for election as a director by the shareholders and (ii) if such director shall be a RCF Director or a nominee of the RCF Directors, then the RCF Directors and nominees of the RCF Directors serving as directors shall have the exclusive right to nominate an individual to fill such vacancy and the entire Board of Directors shall either elect such person a director or, if appropriate, nominate such person for election as a director by the shareholders. Each director will hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws until the earlier of his or her resignation or removal or until his or her respective successor is duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.   3.2 Officers of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, Michael F. Manzulli shall become the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation, Joseph R. Ficalora shall remain the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Surviving Corporation, Anthony E. Burke shall become a Senior Executive Vice President and the Chief Operating Officer of the Surviving Corporation and Thomas R. Cangemi shall become an Executive Vice President of the Surviving Corporation.     4  

     ARTICLE IV  CONVERSION OR CANCELLATION OF SHARES   4.1 Conversion or Cancellation of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any shareholder:   (a) RCF Common Stock. Each share of RCF Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Exception Shares (as hereinafter defined), shall be converted into and constitute 1.02 shares of NYCB Common Stock (subject to Section 4.4, the "Exchange Ratio"), which already gives effect to the NYCB stock dividend payable on March 29, 2001 (the "NYCB Stock Dividend"), together with the related NYCB Stockholder Rights. "Excep- tion Shares" means shares of RCF Common Stock owned or held, other than in a bona fide fiduciary or agency capacity or in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted in good faith, by RCF or a subsidiary (as hereinafter defined) of RCF or held by RCF in treasury or by NYCB or a subsidiary of NYCB.   (b) NYCB Common Stock. Each share of NYCB Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (c) Cancellation of Old Shares. Each Exception Share shall cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of RCF Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Exception Shares, is hereinafter defined as an "Old Share." Old Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (an "Old Certificate") formerly representing Old Shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except the right to receive, without interest, upon exchange of such Old Certificate in accordance with Section 4.3, a certificate (a "New Certificate") representing the shares of NYCB Common Stock ("New Shares") and any payment to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.   4.2 Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article IV, no fractional shares of NYCB Common Stock will be issued pursuant to the Merger. Instead, NYCB will pay or cause to be paid to the holder of any Old Shares that would, pursuant to paragraph 4.1(a), otherwise be entitled to receive fractional shares of NYCB Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded to nearest cent and without interest, equal to the product of (i) the fraction of a share to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled and (ii) the average of the high and low per share sales prices of NYCB Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date as reported on the Nasdaq National Market System (the "Nasdaq").    5  

      4.3 Exchange of Old Certificates for New Certificates. (a) Appointment of Exchange Agent. Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, NYCB shall make available or cause to be made available to an exchange agent agreed upon by NYCB and RCF (the "Exchange Agent"), New Certificates and cash in amounts sufficient to allow the Exchange Agent to make all deliveries of New Certificates and payments that may be required in exchange for Old Certificates pursuant to this Article IV. Upon such anniversary, any such New Certificates and cash remaining in the possession of the Exchange Agent (together with any dividends or earnings in respect thereof) shall be delivered to NYCB. Any holder of Old Certificates who has not theretofore exchanged his or her Old Certificates for New Certificates and cash pursuant to this Article IV shall thereafter be entitled to look exclusively to NYCB, and only as a general creditor thereof, for the shares of NYCB Common Stock and/or cash to which he or she may be entitled upon exchange of such Old Certificates pursuant to this Article IV. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto, shall be liable to any holder of Old Certificates for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, NYCB shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each individual, bank, corporation, partnership, trust, association or other entity or organization (any of the foregoing, a "Person") who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of RCF Common Stock a form of letter of transmittal in form reasonably satisfactory to NYCB and RCF containing instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Old Certificates in exchange for New Certificates and any payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to this Article IV. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of an Old Certificate for cancellation together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Old Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a New Certificate representing the New Shares and, if applicable, a check in the amount to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article IV, and the Old Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will accrue or be paid with respect to any property to be delivered upon surrender of Old Certificates. If any New Certificate is to be issued, or cash payment made, in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of such New Certificate or the making of such cash payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of NYCB that any such taxes have been paid or are not applicable. An Affiliate (as hereinafter defined) of RCF or NYCB shall not be entitled to receive any New Certificate or payment pursuant to this Article IV until such Affiliate shall have duly executed and delivered an appropriate agreement described in Section 6.13.   (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, no dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to any Person holding an Old Certificate with respect to the New Shares until such Old Certificate has been surrendered for exchange as provided herein. Subject to the effect of applicable    6  

     laws and the immediately preceding sentence, following surrender of any such Old Certificates, there shall be paid to the holder of the New Certificates issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the New Shares represented thereby.   (d) Transfers. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Old Shares.   (e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate, issue or cause to be issued a New Certificate and pay or cause to be paid the amounts, if any, deliverable in respect to the Old Shares formerly represented by such Old Certificate pursuant to this Article IV.   4.4 Adjustment of Exchange Ratio. In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Plan but prior to the Effective Time, the shares of NYCB Common Stock issued and outstanding shall, through a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in the capitalization of NYCB, increase or decrease in number or be changed into or exchanged for a different kind or number of securities, then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that no proportionate adjustment shall be made in respect of the NYCB Stock Dividend.    ARTICLE V  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   5.1 Disclosure Letters. Prior to the execution and delivery hereof, RCF has delivered to NYCB, and NYCB has delivered to RCF, a letter (as the case may be, its "Disclosure Letter") setting forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more of such party\'s representations or warranties contained in Section 5.3 or to one or more of its covenants contained in Article VI; provided, that (a) no such item is required to be set forth in the Disclosure Letter as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard established by Section 5.2, and (b) the mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Letter as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by a party that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to    7  

     result in a Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined) with respect to either RCF or to NYCB, respectively.   5.2 Standards. (a) No representation or warranty of any party hereto contained in Section 5.3 (other than the representations and warranties in Sections 5.3(c), 5.3(d)(i), 5.3(f)(ii) and (iii), 5.3(g)(B), 5.3(m) and 5.3(q) which shall be true and correct in all material respects) shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and no party hereto shall be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence or absence of any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances or events inconsistent with any representation or warranty contained in Section 5.3, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on such party.   (b) The term "Material Adverse Effect" means an effect which (A) is materially adverse to the business, properties, financial condition or results of operations of NYCB or RCF, as the context may dictate, and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) materially impairs or delays the ability of NYCB or RCF to consummate the Merger or (C) enables any Person to prevent or materially delay the consummation by NYCB or RCF of the Merger; provided, however, that in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred there shall be excluded any effect attributable to or resulting from (i) any changes in laws, regulations or interpretations of laws or regulations generally affecting the banking or bank holding company businesses, but not uniquely relating to NYCB or RCF, (ii) any change in generally accepted accounting principles or regulatory accounting requirements, generally affecting the banking or bank holding company businesses, but not uniquely relating to NYCB or RCF, (iii) events, conditions or trends in economic, business or financial conditions generally or affecting the banking or bank holding company businesses specifically, except to the extent any such events, conditions or trends in economic, business or financial conditions have a disproportionately adverse effect upon NYCB or RCF, as the context may dictate, and (iv) the effects of the actions contemplated by Section 6.8.   5.3 Representations and Warranties of NYCB and RCF. Subject to and giving effect to Sections 5.1 and 5.2 and except as set forth in the relevant Disclosure Letter, NYCB hereby represents and warrants to RCF, and RCF hereby represents and warrants to NYCB, that:   (a) Corporate Organization and Qualification. It is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

(b) NYCB shall cause the Persons serving as officers and directors of RCF immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six years after the Effective Time by the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy currently maintained by RCF (provided that NYCB may substitute policies providing comparable or better coverage than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such; provided, however, that in no event shall NYCB be required to expend more than 200% of the amount currently expended by RCF (the "Maximum Amount") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto, and provided further that, if NYCB is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 6.12(b), NYCB shall use its best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as available for the Maximum Amount; provided further, that such Persons may be required to make application and provide customary representations and warranties to NYCB\'s insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance.
