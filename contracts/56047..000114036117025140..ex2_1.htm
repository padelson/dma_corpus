Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date, Seller shall in good faith
estimate Net Working Capital as of the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date and shall provide Buyer with written
notice thereof and of the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment. The existence
of any dispute with respect to any such calculations shall not delay or
otherwise affect the Closing or the obligation to make the payments specified
in _Section 2.5_ at the Closing. For purposes of calculating Net Working
Capital, all payments made at Closing pursuant to _Section 5.5_ shall be
deemed to have been paid as of as of the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date.

  

  

 

17  

  

(b) Within 45 days after Closing, Buyer shall provide Seller with its good
faith calculation of Net Working Capital as of the Closing and the Working
Capital Adjustment, as well as detailed supporting information, which clearly
delineates the specific line item differences between Buyer's new calculation
and Seller's previous calculation. If Seller disagrees with any of the
calculations provided by Buyer pursuant to the notice referenced in the
foregoing sentence, then it shall provide Buyer with written notice thereof
within 30 days after receiving written notice thereof and shall include
reasonable detail regarding such specific objections. If Buyer and Seller
working in good faith are unable to agree on such disputed items on or prior
to the 90th day following the Closing Date, then either Party may refer such
dispute to Deloitte LLP or, if that firm declines to act as provided in this
_Section 2.6(b)_ , another firm of independent public accountants, mutually
acceptable to Buyer and Seller (such selected firm being the "Accounting
Firm"), which firm shall make a final and binding determination as to all
matters in dispute on a timely basis and promptly shall notify the Parties in
writing of its resolution. Such Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not
as a mediator or arbitrator and shall not have the power to modify or amend
any term or provision of this Agreement. Each of Buyer and Seller shall bear
and pay one-half of the fees and other costs charged by such Accounting Firm.
If Seller does not object to Buyer's calculations within the time period and
in the manner set forth in the second sentence of this _Section 2.6(b)_ or
accepts Buyer's calculations, then such calculations as set forth in Buyer's
notice shall become final and binding upon the Parties for all purposes
hereunder.

  

  

(c) If the Working Capital Adjustment (as agreed between Buyer and Seller or
as determined by the above-referenced accounting firm or otherwise) is (i)
greater than the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment as paid by Buyer at
Closing, then Buyer shall pay to Seller within five Business Days after such
amounts are so agreed or determined, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by Seller, the amount of such
difference or (ii) less than the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment as paid
by Buyer at Closing, then Seller and Buyer shall execute a joint instruction
to the Working Capital Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer, within five Business Days
after such amounts are agreed or determined, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Buyer, the amount of such
difference (provided, however, that if such difference exceeds the amount of
funds in the Working Capital Escrow Account, then Seller shall pay the amount
of such shortfall to Buyer, it being agreed that (x) such amount shall be paid
by Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Buyer, and (y) such amount shall be paid directly by Seller and
not from the Indemnity Escrow Account).

  

  

2.7 Purchase Price Allocation. Seller and Buyer agree to allocate the Purchase
Price and any other items of consideration for federal income Tax purposes in
accordance with _Exhibit E_ (the "Allocation Principles"). Within sixty (60)
days after the determination of the Net Working Capital is agreed to or
determined in accordance with _Section 2.6_ , Seller shall prepare and deliver
to the Buyer an allocation of the Purchase Price and any other items of
consideration for federal income Tax purposes, which shall be allocated among
the Purchased IP, the stock of the Corporate Subsidiaries, the assets of the
Companies (other than the Corporate Subsidiaries), (taking into account any
adjustments for Tax purposes pursuant to _Section 2.6_ (the "Allocation"), and
thereafter, Buyer and Seller will act in good faith and reasonably cooperate
with each other to agree on the Allocation. If Buyer and Seller cannot agree
on the Allocation within thirty (30) days of the delivery of the Allocation to
Seller, Buyer and Seller will resolve the dispute in accordance with the
dispute resolution procedures contained in _Section 2.6(b)_. Any Allocation
determined by the Accounting Firm shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent
with the Allocation Principles. The cost of the Accounting Firm shall be borne
equally by Seller and Buyer. Buyer and Seller agree (a) to file, and to cause
their respective Affiliates to file, all Tax Returns in a manner consistent
with the Allocation agreed to by Buyer and Seller or, if applicable,
determined pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures contained in _Section
2.6(b)_ and not to take (and to cause their respective Affiliates not to take)
any position inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return, audit, examination,
claim, adjustment, litigation or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes,
unless required to do so by applicable Law or with prior written consent of
the other Party, and (b) that the Allocation shall be further revised, as
necessary and in a manner consistent with the Allocation, to reflect any
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 5.6(i)_ or otherwise
that is not reflected in the Allocation. In the event any Taxing Authority
disputes such Allocation, the Party receiving notice thereof shall promptly
notify and consult with the other Party concerning such dispute.

  

  

 

18  

  

2.8 Withholdings. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Purchase

is owed any amount from, owes any amount to, guarantees any amount owed by,
has any Contracts with or has any commitments to any other Company, Affiliate,
officer or director of a Company or any member of a family group of any of the
foregoing; provided, however, that the foregoing does not include amounts owed
by any Subsidiary to any other Subsidiary. Except as set forth on _Schedule
3.24_ , no officer, director or any Affiliate of a Company (except in his or
her capacity as such) has any direct or indirect interest in (a) any property

3.26 Securities Laws Matters.

  

  

(a) Seller has such knowledge, skill and experience in business, financial and
investment matters that Seller is capable of evaluating the merits and risks
of an investment in Kirby Common Stock. With the assistance of its own
professional advisors, to the extent that Seller has deemed appropriate,
Seller has made its own legal, Tax, accounting and financial evaluation of the
merits and risks of an investment in Kirby Common Stock. Seller has considered
the suitability of the Share Consideration as an investment in light of its
own circumstances and financial condition and is able to bear the risks
associated with an investment in the Share Consideration.

  

  

(b) Seller is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a) under the
Securities Act.

  

  

(c) Seller is acquiring the Share Consideration solely for its own beneficial
account, for investment purposes, and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution of the Share Consideration in a manner that
would require registration under or violate the registration requirements of
any state or federal securities Law. Seller understands that the shares of
Kirby Common Stock issued as Share Consideration have not been registered
under the Securities Act or any state securities Laws by reason of specific
exemptions under the provisions thereof which depend in part upon the
investment intent of Seller and the other representations made by Seller in
this Agreement. Seller understands that Buyer is relying upon the
representations and agreements contained in this _Section 3.26_ (and any
supplemental information provided by Seller) for the purpose of determining
whether this transaction meets the requirements for such exemptions.

  

  

(d) Seller understands that the shares of Kirby Common Stock issued hereunder
as Share Consideration are "restricted securities" under applicable federal
securities laws and that the Securities Act and the rules of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") provide in substance that
Seller may dispose of such shares only pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom, and Seller
understands that the Company has no obligation or present intention to
register any of such shares. Seller further understands that any certificates
representing such shares will be imprinted with a legend in substantially the
following form (and that similar restrictions will be noted in the transfer
agent's and registrar's records for any such shares issued in book-entry
form):

  

 

 

  

 

34  

  

"THE SECURITIES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT") OR THE
SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE
OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT (1) PURSUANT TO AN
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR (2) PURSUANT TO AN
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, IN EACH CASE IN
ACCORDANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND THE SECURITIES LAWS
OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS."

  


 

  

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing representations and warranties
of Seller set forth in subsections (a) through (d) shall not prohibit (i)
Seller from distributing all or any portion of the Share Consideration to any
of its members (a "Member Transferee") or (ii) Seller or such Member
Transferee from selling all or any portion of the Share Consideration at any
time pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement upon its effectiveness and
the Buyer agrees that any such actions undertaken shall not be a breach of
such representations and warranties of Seller (and certification of a Member
Transferee pursuant to subsection (f)).

  


 

  

(f) Seller has, prior to the time it sought to obtain the consent or vote of
any of its security holders or members regarding the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, obtained the written acknowledgement, representation and
agreement of each such security holder or member as to the matters set forth
in _Exhibit F_.

  


 

  

3.27 Broker's Commissions. Neither Seller nor any Company has, directly or
indirectly, entered into any Contract with any Person that would obligate a
Company or any of its Affiliates to pay any commission, brokerage fee or
"finder's fee" in connection with the transactions contemplated herein.

to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
commercially reasonable, including: (i) the taking of such commercially
reasonable actions as are necessary to obtain any requisite approvals,
consents, orders, exemptions or waivers by any Governmental Body or any other
Person, including the Company Consents and the Seller Approvals and (ii) using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the satisfaction of all conditions to
Closing; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall require the
Companies or the Sellers to make any payment to any third party in order to
secure such third party's consent to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Each of the Buyer and Sellers shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) keep the other party reasonably informed of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Body
and of any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding

to any Governmental Body or, in connection with any proceeding by a private

permitted by such applicable Governmental Body or other person, give the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences and (iv) permit the other party to review and approve, in advance
of submission, any written submissions to any Governmental Body or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, to any other Person.

  

  

 

37  

  

(c) In connection with any such filings, Buyer shall cooperate in good faith
with Governmental Authorities and undertake promptly any and all actions
required to complete lawfully the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

(d) Each of Seller and Buyer shall provide prompt notification to the other
when it becomes aware that any consent or approval referred to in this
_Section 5.1_ is obtained, taken, made, given or denied, as applicable.

  


 

  

(e) In furtherance of the foregoing covenants:

order permitting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, but
requiring any of the Assets or lines of business of Buyer, Seller or any of
their respective Affiliates to be held separate or sold or disposed of
thereafter (including the Business and Assets of the Companies), shall be
deemed a failure to satisfy the conditions specified in _Article VI_ or
_Article VII_.

  

  

 

38  

  

5.2 Access of Buyer.

  


 

  

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing (the "Interim Period"), Seller will
provide Buyer and its Representatives with full access, upon reasonable prior
notice and during normal business hours, to the Assets of the Companies and
the officers and employees of Seller and its Affiliates, but only to the
extent that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the business of
Seller or its Affiliates or the safe commercial operations of the Assets of
the Companies; provided, however, that (A) all such activities will be
coordinated through a single person designated for such purpose by Seller, (B)
Seller shall have the right to have a Representative present for any
communication with employees or officers of Seller or its Affiliates and (C)
Buyer shall and shall cause its Representatives to observe and comply with all
health, safety and security requirements of each of the Companies. Buyer shall
hold in confidence all such information on the terms and subject to the
conditions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, provided, however, if
the Confidentiality Agreement was executed by an Affiliate of Buyer, then
Buyer hereby agrees to be bound by and to comply with the terms and conditions
of such Confidentiality Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.2_ , Buyer
shall have no right of access to, and neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
shall have any obligation to provide any information the disclosure of which
(1) could reasonably be expected to jeopardize any privilege available to
Seller or its Affiliates, (2) would cause Seller or its Affiliates to breach a
confidentiality obligation, or (3) would result in a violation of Law.

  


 

  

5.3 Certain Restrictions. Except as required or permitted hereby, or as
consented to by Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), or as otherwise set forth in _Schedule 5.3_, during
the Interim Period, Seller will cause the Companies to operate in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices. Without limiting the
foregoing, except as otherwise required or permitted hereby or required by the
terms of any permit or any Material Contract or as consented to by Buyer,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
Seller will cause the Companies not to undertake any of the following without
the consent of Buyer:

(h) acquire by merger or consolidation with, or by purchase of a substantial
portion of the assets of, or by any other manner, any business or any Person
or any division thereof, or acquire any equity or debt interest in any Person,

(j) except in accordance with the 2017 Budget, agree to incur any capital
expenditure in excess of $1,000,000 (individually or in the aggregate);

  


 

  

(k) adopt, amend or modify any Benefit Plan of a Company except as otherwise

(l) materially increase in the compensation of the Companies' employees, other

have a material adverse effect on the ability of Seller to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

  


 

  

(p) agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

  


 

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may permit the Companies to take
commercially reasonable actions with respect to (i) emergency situations or
(ii) regulatory requirements and/or other requirements of Law and Seller
shall, upon receipt of notice of any such actions, promptly inform Buyer of
any such actions taken outside the ordinary course of business.

  

  

 

40  

  

5.4 Employee and Benefit Matters. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing Date, except as otherwise permitted under this
Agreement, the Companies will not enter into any additional Contracts with
employees, directors or consultants of the Companies that will create any
obligation to Buyer or the Purchased Entities after the Closing Date, or make
or agree to make any material changes to any existing Contracts or agreements
with employees, directors or consultants of the Companies without Buyer's
prior written consent; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
prohibit increases in compensation to employees in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices.

  


 

  

5.5 Transaction Expenses. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, on the Closing Date, contemporaneously with the Closing, Seller will
or will cause the applicable Company to pay all Transaction Expenses, it being
understood that, pursuant to _Section 2.6_ , for the purposes of calculating
Net Working Capital and the Working Capital Adjustment, such payments shall be
deemed to have been paid as of the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date.

  


 

  

5.6 Tax Matters.

  


 

  

(a) As a result of each Subsidiary (other than Stewart and Stevenson Canada
Inc., a New Brunswick corporation, and Stewart and Stevenson Funding Corp., a
Delaware corporation (collectively, the "Corporate Subsidiaries")) being a
Disregarded Entity at the time of the Closing for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes (and state, local, and foreign Tax purposes where applicable), Buyer
and Seller intend that the purchase of the Purchased IP and the Company
Interests pursuant to this Agreement be treated for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes (and state, local, and foreign Tax purposes where applicable) as the
fully taxable purchase by Buyer of the Purchased IP, the stock of the
Corporate Subsidiaries, and all the assets held by each Subsidiary (other than
the Corporate Subsidiaries) in exchange for the Purchase Price and other items
of consideration for U.S. federal income Tax purposes. Buyer and Seller agree
to report and file (and cause their Affiliates to report and file) their U.S.
federal income Tax Returns (and state and local income Tax Returns where
applicable) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with such intended
treatment. Buyer and Seller further agree not to take (and to cause their
respective Affiliates not to take) any position, whether in any Tax Return,
audit, examination, claim, adjustment, litigation or other Proceeding with
respect to U.S. federal income Tax (and state and local income Tax purposes
where applicable), which is inconsistent with such intended treatment.

  


 

  

(b) The Seller shall cause to be timely prepared and filed all Tax Returns for
U.S. federal or state income or franchise Taxes required to be filed for, by,
on behalf of or with respect to the Companies covering all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, whether due before or after the Closing Date, including for those
jurisdictions and Taxing Authorities that permit or require a short-period Tax
Return for income or franchise Taxes for the period ending on the Closing
Date.

  

  

 

41  

  

(c) Except in the case of any Tax Return covered by _Section 5.6(b)_ , Buyer
shall cause to be timely prepared and filed all Tax Returns required to be
filed by any of the Companies after the Closing Date with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the past practices of the Company, except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Buyer shall deliver a draft of
such Tax Returns to Seller for review and comment not less than thirty (30)
days prior to the date on which such Tax Returns are due to be filed (taking
into account any applicable extensions), including a calculation of the
portion of the Taxes shown as due allocable to the pre-Closing portion of a
Straddle Period. Buyer shall consider any reasonable comments in good faith.
In the event that Seller and Buyer are unable to agree on any comments to a
Tax Return (or allocation to the pre-Closing portion of a Straddle Period)
within ten (10) days after Seller has delivered its comments, Seller and Buyer
shall refer such dispute to the Accounting Firm for final determination and
the Accounting Firm shall resolve all remaining disputes pursuant to the
dispute resolution procedures contained in _Section 2.6(b)_. Seller and Buyer
shall split the Accounting Firm's fees equally. Buyer and Seller agree to file
any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, including for this purpose a Tax
Return covering a Straddle Period, or to amend any such Tax Return that was
required to be filed during the period the Accounting Firm was making its
determination, consistent with the Accounting Firm's determinations.

  


 

  

(d) In the case of Taxes of any Company with respect to any Straddle Period,
the portion of any such Tax that is attributable to the portion of the period
ending on the Closing Date shall be:

  


 

  

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income,
sales, revenue, production, receipts or similar items, or other Taxes not
described in _Section 5.6(d)(ii)_ or _Section 5.6(d)(iii)_ or (B) imposed in
connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible), deemed equal to the amount that would be
payable if the taxable years of the Companies ended with (and included) the
Closing Date; provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to
the number of days in each period;

  


 

  

(ii) in the case of any liability for any real property, personal property, ad
valorem and similar Taxes and Taxes that are otherwise imposed on a periodic
basis with respect to the assets of any of the Companies, deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire period; and

  


 

  

(iii) For purposes of the Texas franchise Tax, for the privilege period
beginning on or after January 1, 2017, the amount that would be owed by Seller
from January 1, 2017 to the Closing Date.

  


 

  

(e) After Closing, each Party shall grant or cause its respective Affiliates
to grant to the other Party (or its designees) access at all reasonable times
to all of the records relating to the Companies except Forms 1065 U.S. Return
of Partnership Income of Seller (and to the employees of the Companies for
explanation thereof), and shall afford such other Party (or its designees) the
right (at such other Party's expense) to take extracts therefrom and to make
copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to permit such other Party
(or its designees) to prepare Tax Returns, respond to Tax audits and
investigations, prosecute Tax protests, appeals and refund Claims and to
conduct negotiations with Taxing Authorities.

  

  

 

42  

  

(f) Unless required by applicable Laws, no amended Tax Return with respect to
a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period shall be filed by or on behalf of any
Company without the prior written consent of Seller if such amended Tax Return
would increase the obligations of Seller pursuant to _Article IX_ or decrease
the amount owed to Seller pursuant to _Section 5.6(g)_.

  


 

  

(g) The amount of any refunds of Taxes of the Companies for any Pre-Closing
Period shall be for the account of Seller, but only to the extent such refund
was not included in the final calculation of the Working Capital Adjustment
and was not included in the final calculation of the Purchase Price. The
amount of any refunds of Taxes of the Companies for any Tax period beginning
after the Closing Date shall be for the account of Buyer. The amount of any
refund of Taxes of the Companies for any Straddle Period shall be equitably
apportioned between Buyer and Seller in accordance with the principles set
forth in _Section 5.6(d)_. Each Party shall forward, and shall cause its
Affiliates to forward, to the Party entitled to receive a refund of Tax
pursuant to this _Section 5.6(g)_ the amount of such refund within 30 days
after such refund is received, net any Taxes, costs, or expenses incurred by
such Party or its Affiliates in procuring such refund. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no payment to Seller shall be required pursuant to this _Section
5.6(g)_ to the extent any such refund is attributable to Taxes paid on or
after the Closing Date to the extent Seller has not indemnified Buyer or the
Companies for such Taxes.

  


 

  

(h) Buyer and Seller shall each pay 50% of all documentary, sales, use,
registration and other transfer Taxes (including all applicable real estate
transfer or stock transfer Taxes) and fees incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes").
Each Party agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Taxing Authority or any other Person as
may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Transfer Tax.

  


 

  

(i) The Parties agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this
Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and
foreign income Tax purposes.

  


 

  

5.7 Public Announcements. The Parties will consult with each other prior to
issuing any publication or press release of any nature with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not make or issue,
or cause to be made or issued, any such publication or press release prior to
such consultation and without the prior written consent of the other Party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) except to the
extent, but only to such extent, that, in the opinion of the Party issuing
such publication or press release, such announcement or statement may be
required by Law, any listing agreement with any securities exchange or any
securities exchange regulation, in which case the Party proposing to issue
such publication or press release shall use its reasonable efforts to consult
in good faith with the other Party before issuing any such publication or
press release and shall reasonably cooperate with the other Party in good
faith with respect to the timing, manner and content of disclosure.

  

  

 

43  

  

5.8 Updating. From time to time prior to the Closing, Seller shall supplement
or amend and deliver updates to the Schedules to complete or correct any
information in such Schedules or in any representation or warranty in ARTICLE
III with regard to events, circumstances or matters that arose or occurred
after the date of this Agreement. Any such update made pursuant to this
_Section 5.8_ shall be disregarded for purposes of the conditions to closing
set forth in ARTICLE VI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of the
indemnity obligations of Seller in this Agreement, the Schedules shall be
deemed (i) to include all information contained in any such supplement,
amendment or update thereto that is delivered to Buyer on or before the tenth
(10th) Business Day preceding the Closing Date, and (ii) _not_ to include any
information contained in any such supplement, amendment or update thereto that
is delivered to Buyer after the tenth (10th) Business Day preceding the
Closing Date or is otherwise brought to the attention of Buyer after such
tenth (10th) Business Day.

  


 

  

5.9 Escrows. The Buyer is entitled to all or a portion of the Working Capital
Escrowed Cash to the extent of any obligations of the Seller under _Section
2.6_ and the Indemnity Escrowed Shares to the extent of any obligations of the
Seller under _Section 9.2_. To the extent funds or Indemnity Escrowed Shares,
as applicable, are due to Buyer, Buyer and Seller shall jointly instruct the
Working Capital Escrow Agent or the Indemnity Escrow Agent, as applicable, to
release such funds or Indemnity Escrowed Shares to Buyer that are specified
with reasonable detail by the Seller. In the event there is a dispute
regarding the amount of funds or shares to be released from the Working
Capital Escrow Account or the Indemnity Escrow Account, only that portion of
the funds or shares in dispute shall be held back and not released until
resolution of the dispute. If any Indemnity Escrowed Shares remains in the
Indemnity Escrow Account on the second anniversary of the Closing Date and
there is no indemnity Claim of the Buyer then still unresolved (or otherwise
once all such Claims are resolved), the Parties shall execute and deliver to
the Indemnity Escrow Agent joint written instructions promptly to deliver all
such remaining shares to Seller. If any Working Capital Escrowed Cash (or
interest thereon) remains in the Working Capital Escrow Account on the date
that such Working Capital Adjustment is resolved and there is no Working
Capital Adjustment payable to Buyer, the Parties shall execute and deliver to
the Working Capital Escrow Agent joint written instructions promptly to
deliver all such amounts by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
Seller. For the purposes of valuing any Indemnity Escrowed Shares to be
released from the Indemnity Escrow Account in satisfaction of an indemnity
claim under this Agreement, such Indemnity Escrowed Shares shall be valued
based upon the volume-weighted average price of a share of Kirby Common Stock
for the 20 trading day period ending at the close of trading on the NYSE
immediately preceding the date of the joint written instruction.

  


 

  

5.10 Excluded Assets. Seller shall retain all of its right, title and interest
in and to any Excluded Assets or, if any Excluded Asset is owned or otherwise
held by one of the Purchased Entities or their subsidiaries, Seller shall
cause such Purchased Entity or subsidiary to transfer, convey and assign any
and all right, title and interest of such Company in and to the Excluded
Assets to Seller or another Person designated by Seller, and shall cause such
transferee to assume the Excluded Liabilities.

  

  

 

44  

  

5.11 Use of Marks and Names. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, as
between Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and its
Affiliates, on the other hand, following the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Purchased Entities and their respective subsidiaries) shall
have the sole and exclusive worldwide right to the use of the name "Stewart and
Stevenson." Accordingly, within three (3) Business Days of the Closing, Seller
shall, and shall cause all of its Affiliates to, cease all use of the name
"Stewart and Stevenson" and any trademarks, servicemarks, tradenames, trade
dress or other use of any kind containing "Stewart and Stevenson," and shall
change its registered name in its state of organization to a name that does
not include "Stewart and Stevenson" or abbreviations of such name.

  


 

  

5.12 Employee Matters.

  


 

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, an Affiliate of Buyer designated by Buyer (which for
this purpose may include one or more of the Purchased Entities or their
subsidiaries), shall make an offer of employment pursuant to an offer letter
(an "Offer Letter") to each employee of Seller who:

  


 

  

(i) is then employed by Seller,

  


 

  

(ii) passes Buyer's (A) pre-employment background check, (B) drug and alcohol
screening, and (C) verification of employment eligibility using Form I-9;

  


 

  

(iii) is not a Scheduled Excluded Employee; and

  


 

  

(iv) is not an employee of Seller covered by the October 9, 2016 collective
bargaining agreement between Seller and International Union of Operating
Engineers, Local 15C ("CBA") ("Bargaining Unit Employees").

  


 

  

Each such employee to whom an offer is made pursuant to the foregoing is
referred to herein as an "Offered Employee." Such employment, if accepted,
shall commence as of the Closing Date and be contingent upon the completion of
the Closing. Each Offered Employee who accepts such offer of employment and is
employed by Buyer or one of its Affiliates at the Closing shall be referred to
herein as a "New Buyer Employee." Seller shall terminate each Offered
Employee's employment with Seller as of the Closing Date.

  


 

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall transfer the employment of all
Bargaining Unit Employees to Stewart and Stevenson Power Products LLC ("Power
Products"). In connection therewith, effective as of the Closing Date, Power
Products shall assume all of Seller's rights and obligations arising under the
CBA on and after the Closing and recognize the union party to the CBA.

  


 

  

(c) The terms of employment with Buyer's designated Affiliate for New Buyer
Employees shall be upon such terms and conditions as Buyer or its Affiliates
determine in their discretion; provided, however, that such terms shall be, at
the time of such offer, in the aggregate, comparable to the terms and
conditions of their employment by Seller (other than any terms with respect to
a particular term of employment). The terms of employment with Power Products
for Bargaining Unit Employees shall continue to be governed by the CBA.

  

  

 

45  

  

(d) No provision of this _Section 5.12_ shall create any third-party
beneficiary rights (including any rights of continued employment or rights to
a particular term of employment) in any employee or former employee (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of Seller or shall create or bestow any
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any Person other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing herein
shall (i) constitute or create an employment agreement, or (ii) constitute or
be deemed to constitute an amendment to any Benefit Plan or any employee
benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates.

  


 

  

(e) Effective as of the Closing Date, all liabilities related to the
employment or termination of employment of any Offered Employee or Bargaining
Unit Employee, whether arising before or after the Closing, shall be assumed
by Buyer (or Buyer's designated Affiliate or Affiliates), including, with
respect to Power Products, any potential withdrawal liability and all
liabilities under the CBA.

  


 

  

(f) Effective no later than one Business Day prior to the Closing Date (but
contingent on the occurrence of the Closing), Seller and one of the Purchased
Entities will take such action as is necessary (including amending the Benefit
Plans, obtaining any required consents, and providing any required notice to a
labor union or governmental entity) to transfer sponsorship of any and all
Benefit Plans sponsored by Seller to such Purchased Entity. In connection with
such transfer, all trust agreements, insurance contracts, and agreements with
third parties relating to administration of a Benefit Plan to which Seller is
a party also shall be transferred from Seller to the Purchased Entity which
assumes sponsorship of such Benefit Plan. For periods on and after the date of
such transfer, Seller shall have no liability related to the Benefit Plans.

  


 

  

(g) Buyer or its Affiliate shall assume, bear and discharge all liabilities
and obligations, and Seller and its Affiliates shall have no liability or
obligation whatsoever, for providing required notices and continuation
coverage pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601 through 609 of
ERISA to all employees of Seller and its Affiliates (including Scheduled
Excluded Employees) whose employment with Seller and its Affiliates is
terminated in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and to such employees' eligible spouses and dependents.

  


 

  

(h) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending January 31, 2019.
Buyer agrees that, unless a variance or exemption is in effect pursuant to
Section 4204(c) of ERISA, it will provide to and for the benefit of the
Central Pension Fund of the International Union of Operating Engineers and
Participating Employers ("Multiemployer Pension Plan") either a bond in the
amount of $1,099,367 issued by a corporate surety company that is an
acceptable surety for purposes of Section 412 of ERISA or an amount held in
escrow by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the
Multiemployer Pension Plan.

  

  

 

46  

  

5.13 Related Party Drilling Rigs. Buyer will store and preserve, consistent
with industry practice and as reasonably directed by Seller, the Rigs;
provided, however, that Buyer will not charge Seller any storage fees and
Seller will reimburse Buyer for any out-of-pocket costs incurred by Buyer
preserve the Rigs. Buyer will support Seller's efforts to market the Rigs, as
reasonably requested by Seller. Seller will provide broad form, all-risk
property and casualty insurance coverage for the Rigs with a coverage limit
not less than the greater of Seller's cost or full replacement value. Such
insurance will name Seller as loss payee. To the extent the Rigs are owned by
a Purchased Entity or one of its Subsidiaries, Seller will cause such entity
to convey the Rigs to Seller effective as of the Closing pursuant to an
instrument reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

  


 

  

5.14 Letters of Credit. Prior to the Closing, Buyer will make arrangements to
replace the letters of credit identified on _Schedule 5.14_ and will cause
such letters of credit to be returned to Seller at the Closing, or will make
alternate arrangements to enable Seller to obtain a release of the liens
specified on _Schedule 1.1-PL_.

  


 

  

5.15 Exclusivity.

  


 

  

(a) Seller will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates or
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate, or
encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any Person relating to
the acquisition of any interest in or any substantial portion of the assets of
Seller or any of the Companies (other than Excluded Assets), whether by way of
stock purchase, asset purchase, merger, reorganization, consolidation, share
exchange or otherwise (an "Acquisition Proposal"), or (b) participate in any
discussion or negotiation regarding, or furnish any information with respect
to, assist or participate in, directly or indirectly, or facilitate in any
other manner, any effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek to do any of
the foregoing.

  


 

  

(b) In addition to the other obligations under this _Section 5.15_ , Seller
shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day after receipt
thereof by such Seller or its Representatives), advise Buyer orally and in
writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any request for information with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or which could
reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the
identity of the Person making the same.

  


 

  

(c) Seller agrees that the rights and remedies of non-compliance with this
_Section 5.15_ shall include having such provision specifically enforced
against Seller, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or
threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to Buyer and that money
damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer.

  


 

  

5.16 Citizenship. Seller shall take all actions necessary for Seller to become
prior to, and remain through, the Closing Date a "citizen of the United
States" within the meaning of 46 U.S.C. § 50501(a), (b) and (d) and the
regulations promulgated thereunder. Seller shall provide to Buyer, upon
request, evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that all such actions have
been taken.

  

  

 

47  

  

5.17 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at any time or from time to time after the Closing, at either
Party's request and without further consideration, the other Party shall (and
in the case of Buyer, Buyer shall and shall cause the applicable Companies to)
execute and deliver to such Party such other instruments of sale, transfer,
conveyance, assignment and confirmation, provide such materials and
information and take such other actions as such Party may reasonably request
in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
particular, Seller agrees to assign and transfer to Buyer, and to cause its
Affiliates to assign and transfer to Buyer, in each case for no further
consideration, any Assets, rights or other properties owned or held by Seller
or its Affiliates and that have been used in the Business on or prior to the
Closing that have not otherwise been transferred to Buyer at the Closing. In
addition, if, after the Closing Date, Seller or any of its Affiliates receives
any payment or instrument that is for the account of a Purchased Entity,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly deliver such amount
or instrument to the applicable Purchased Entity. The Parties agree that they
will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Working
Capital Escrow Agent and the Indemnity Escrow Agent, respectively, to return
at the Closing a duly executed counterpart executed by each such Escrow Agent
to the Working Capital Escrow Agreement and Indemnity Escrow Agreement, as
applicable.

  


 

  

5.18 Certain Drilling Rigs. At or prior to the Closing, the Seller shall cause
Power Products and Energy Equipment International Ltd. ("EI") to enter into a
written agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer,
pursuant to which (i) EI will assign and transfer its interest in the Rigs to
Power Products, free and clear of all Liens, in exchange for a cash payment of
$12,000,000 from Power Products to EI, which payment will be due at the
Closing, and (ii) EI and Power Products will terminate (A) the Purchase
Contract dated October 30, 2009 between EI and Power Products (SandS Ref. No.
HOU09-0134-DIAJ), and (B) the Purchase Contract dated October 30, 2009 between
EI and Power Products (SandS Ref. No. HOU09-0135-DIAJ) (collectively, the "Rig
Construction Contracts"), which termination will provide that Power Products
will have no liabilities or obligations to EI of any kind with respect to the
Construction Contracts or the Rigs (the "Rig Agreement").

date, such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all
material respects (or in all respects in the case of any representation or
warranty containing any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualification)
as of such earlier date. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the foregoing
reference to "in all material respects" shall not refer to a Material Adverse

49  

  

7.3 Orders and Laws. No Governmental Authority will have enacted, issued,

by this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  


 

  

7.4 Consents and Approvals. HSR Approval, the Seller Approvals and the Company
Consents set forth on _Schedule 7.4_ shall have been duly obtained, made or

ARTICLE VIII 
  TERMINATION

  


 

  

8.1 Right of Termination. Prior to Closing, this Agreement may be terminated:

  


 

  

(a) Upon mutual written consent by the Parties;

  


 

  

(b) By Buyer, by providing Seller with written notice of such termination, if
there shall have been a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Seller or
the Companies;

  


 

  

(c) By either Seller or Buyer if the Closing has not occurred before August
14, 2017 (the "Outside Date"); provided, however, that a Party shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ if
such Party is then in material breach of this Agreement;

  


 

  

(d) By Seller or Buyer if consummation of the Transactions is enjoined,
prohibited or otherwise restrained by the terms of a final, non-appealable
order;

  


 

  

(e) By Buyer by delivering written notice to Seller at any time prior to the
Closing in the event (i) Seller or a Company is in breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement,
or if any representation or warranty of Seller shall have been untrue when
made or shall have become untrue, (ii) the Buyer has notified the Seller of
the breach or untruth in writing, (iii) there is a reasonable likelihood that
such breach or untruth will result in the failure of any conditions set forth
in _ARTICLE VI_ and (iv) such breach is incapable of cure by the Outside Date
or has continued without cure for a period of thirty (30) days after delivery
of such notice of breach; provided, however, that the Buyer shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ if the
Buyer is then in material breach of this Agreement; or

  

  

 

50  

  

(f) By Seller by delivering written notice to Buyer at any time prior to the
Closing in the event (i) Buyer is in breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or
warranty of Buyer shall have been untrue when made or shall have become
untrue, (ii) Seller has notified the Buyer of the breach or untruth in
writing, (iii) there is a reasonable likelihood that such breach or untruth
will result in the failure of any conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VIII_ and
(iv) such breach is incapable of cure by the Outside Date or has continued
without cure for a period of thirty (30) days after delivery of such notice of
breach; provided, however, that the Seller shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(f)_ if the Seller is
then in material breach of this Agreement.

  


 

  

8.2 Effect of Termination. If either Party terminates this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.1_, all obligations and liabilities of the Parties under this
Agreement shall terminate and become void; provided, however, that (a) nothing
herein shall relieve any Party from liability for fraud, (b) if this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ or _Section 8.1(f)_ due to a
material, willful, intentional and knowing breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, the breaching party will
pay to the terminating party within five Business Days after termination
$25,000,000 in cash (the "Termination Fee"), as liquidated damages to
compensate such terminating party for such breach of this Agreement, and (c)
the terms of _Sections 5.7_ , _8.2_ and _ARTICLE IX_ (other than _Section
11.12_ ) shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, a Party shall only be required to
pay the Termination Fee once. The Parties agree that quantifying and proving
damages resulting from a breach of this Agreement with respect to which the
Termination Fee is payable would be difficult and the Parties agree that the
Termination Fee is not a penalty or intended to punish the Party required to
pay the Termination Fee, but instead is a reasonable measure of damages based
on the experience of the Parties in the Business and the nature of the damages
that may result from such breach of this Agreement. Except in the case of
fraud, the Termination Fee will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Parties for breach hereunder in the event this Agreement is terminated.

  


 

  

ARTICLE IX 
  LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY, WAIVERS AND ARBITRATION

  


 

  

9.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and

its respective officers, managers, partners, directors, Affiliates, employees
or agents in connection with, arising out of or resulting from:

  


 

  

(a) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer
in this Agreement or in any certificate, document or agreement delivered
pursuant to _Section 2.5_ ; and

and Seller shall be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to _Sections 9.2(a)_,
_9.2(b)_ , _9.3(a)_ , and _9.3(b)_ , as applicable, for Losses only if and to
the extent that the aggregate amount of all such Losses incurred by Buyer or
Seller (as applicable) exceeds $5,000,000, and (ii) the maximum amount for
which Seller will be liable to the Buyer under _Section 9.2(a)_ or _9.2(b)_ or
Buyer will be liable to Seller under _Section 9.3(a)_ or _9.3(b)_ shall be
$50,000,000.

  

  

 

52  

  

(b) No indemnifying Person shall be liable for any Losses that are
indemnifiable under _Sections 9.2(a)_ or _9.3(a)_ unless a written demand for
indemnification under this Agreement is delivered by the indemnified Person to
the indemnifying Person with respect thereto prior to 5:00 p.m. on the final
date pursuant to _Section 9.1_ , if any, to assert a Claim for indemnification
on the basis asserted in such written demand.

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
under no circumstances shall any Party be entitled to double recovery under
this Agreement, and to the extent a Party is compensated for a matter through
the Working Capital Adjustment or insurance recovery, such Party shall not
have a separate right to indemnification such matter. Each Party agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to collect all amounts recoverable under any
applicable insurance policies.

  


 

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
limitations imposed by _Sections 9.4(a)_ shall not apply to indemnification
Claims with respect to Excluded Representations.

  


 

  

(e) In the event that, following the Closing, Buyer or a Company actually
recovers amounts from a third party (including an insurer) with respect to a
Claim for which Buyer or the Company have already received an indemnification
payment (from the Indemnity Escrow Account), then Buyer or such Company, as
applicable, will promptly return to the Indemnity Escrow Account the amount it
received from it with respect to such Claim if the Base Survival Period has
not expired at such time, or pay to the Seller the amount it received from the
Indemnity Escrow Account with respect to such Claim if the Base Survival
Period has expired at such time.

  


 

  

(f) For the purpose of determining the amount or value of a Claim for which
indemnification is available under this ARTICLE IX, any references or
qualifications in the underlying representation, warranty, covenant, or
agreement with respect to materiality (including Material Adverse Effect)
shall be disregarded; provided, however, that the representation of Seller in
_Section 3.10(a)_ shall not be considered to be qualified by Material Adverse
Effect.

  


 

  

9.5 Claims Procedures.

  


 

  

(a) Promptly after receipt by any indemnified Person of notice of the
commencement or assertion of any Claim or Proceeding by a third party or
circumstances which, with the lapse of time, such indemnified Person believes
is likely to give rise to a Claim or Proceeding by a third party or of facts
causing any indemnified Person to believe it has a Claim for breach hereunder
(an "Asserted Liability"), such indemnified Person shall give prompt written
notice thereof (the "Claims Notice") to the relevant indemnifying Person. The
Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and
shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of the Loss that has been
or may be suffered. The indemnified Person and the indemnifying Person agree
to keep each other reasonably appraised of any additional information
concerning any Asserted Liability.

  

  

 

53  

  

(b) As to an Asserted Liability arising from a third party action, the
indemnifying Person shall be, subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Section 9.5_ , entitled to assume control of and appoint lead counsel for
such defense; provided, however, that the indemnifying Person shall not have
the right to assume control of the defense of any Asserted Liability (i) to
the extent that the object of such Asserted Liability is to obtain an
injunction, restraining order, declaratory relief or other non-monetary relief
against the indemnified Person which, if successful, would materially
adversely affect the Business, operations, Assets, or financial condition of
the indemnified Person, or (ii) if the named parties to any such action or
proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both indemnified Persons
and the indemnifying Person and the former shall have been advised in writing
by counsel (with a copy to the indemnifying Person) that there are one or more
legal or equitable defenses available to them that are different from or
additional to those available to indemnifying Persons; provided, further,
however, that to exercise such rights the indemnifying Person must give notice
to the indemnified Person within 90 days after receipt of any such Claims
Notice whether it is assuming control of and appointing lead counsel for such
defense. If the indemnifying Person does not give such notice within such
90-day period, then the indemnified Person shall have the right to assume
control of the defense thereof at the cost and expense of the indemnifying
Person, subject to the limitations of liability and other limits set forth in
_Section 9.3(a)_.

  


 

  

(c) If the indemnifying Person shall assume the control of the defense of the
Asserted Liability in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 9.5_ ,
(i) the indemnifying Person shall obtain the prior written consent of the
indemnified Person (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) before entering into any settlement, compromise, admission or
acknowledgement of the validity of such Asserted Liability if the settlement
does not unconditionally release the indemnified Person and, if applicable,
any of the affected Companies, from all liabilities and obligations with
respect to such Asserted Liability or the settlement imposes any non-monetary,
injunctive or other equitable relief against the indemnified Person or, if
applicable, any Company and (ii) the indemnified Person shall be entitled to
participate, at its own cost and expense, in the defense of such Asserted
Liability and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose.

  


 

  

(d) If the indemnified Person shall assume the control of the defense of any
Asserted Liability in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 9.5_ ,
(i) the indemnified Person shall obtain the prior written consent of the
indemnifying Person (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) before entering into any settlement, compromise, admission or
acknowledgement of the validity of such Asserted Liability and (ii) the
indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate, at its cost and expense,
in the defense of such Asserted Liability and to employ separate counsel of
its choice for such purpose.

  


 

  

(e) Each Party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Asserted Liability arising
from a third party action and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such
records, information and testimony (subject to any applicable confidentiality
agreement), and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  

  

 

54  

  

9.6 Waiver of Remedies.

  


 

  

(a) The Parties hereby agree that no Party shall have any liability, and
neither Party nor any of their respective Affiliates shall make any Claim, for
any Loss or any other matter, under, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement (including breach of representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement) or any other Contract or other matter delivered pursuant hereto,
whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise,
except as expressly provided herein.

  


 

  

(b) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, NO PARTY NOR
ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES SHALL BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES THAT ARE NOT THE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE CONSEQUENCE OF THE
BREACH OR ACTION (OR INACTION) IN QUESTION, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OTHER LAW OR OTHERWISE AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM THE
OTHER PARTY'S OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES' SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE,
STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT, ("NON-REIMBURSABLE DAMAGES") PROVIDED
HOWEVER, THAT THE TERM "NON-REIMBURSABLE DAMAGES" SHALL NOT INCLUDE, AND THIS
_SECTION 9.6(b)_ SHALL NOT LIMIT AN INDEMNIFIED PERSON'S RIGHT TO
INDEMNIFICATION WITH RESPECT TO, ANY SUCH DAMAGES ACTUALLY INCURRED BY SUCH
INDEMNIFIED PERSON IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD PARTY CLAIM.

  


 

  

9.7 Access to Information. After the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall
grant each other (or their respective designees), and Buyer shall cause the
Companies to grant to Seller (or its designee), access at all reasonable times
to all of the records relating to the Companies in its possession or the
possession of the Companies, and shall afford such party the right (at such
party's expense) to take extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the
extent reasonably necessary to implement the provisions of, or to investigate
or defend any Claims among the Parties and/or their Affiliates arising under,
this Agreement. Buyer shall maintain, and shall cause the Companies to
maintain, such records until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date (or
for such longer period of time as Seller shall advise Buyer is necessary in
order to have records available with respect to Tax matters), or if any of the
records pertain to any Claim or Dispute pending on the seventh anniversary of
the Closing Date, Buyer shall maintain any of the records designated by Seller
or its Representatives until such Claim or Dispute is finally resolved and the
time for all appeals has been exhausted.

  


 

  

9.8 Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.

  


 

  

(a) In the event of any dispute, controversy or Claim among the Parties, or
any of them, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or
invalidity thereof (collectively, a "Dispute"), the Parties shall attempt in
the first instance to resolve such Dispute through friendly consultations
between senior management of the Parties. The Parties agree to attempt to
resolve all Disputes arising hereunder promptly, equitably and in a good faith
manner. The Parties further agree to provide each other with reasonable access
during normal business hours to any and all non-privileged records,
information and data pertaining to such Dispute, upon reasonable advance
notice.

  

  

 

55  

  

(b) If such consultations do not result in a resolution of the Dispute within
30 Business Days after written notice by a Party to the other Parties
describing the Dispute and requesting friendly consultation, then the Dispute
may be submitted by any Party to binding arbitration pursuant to the terms of
this _Section 9.8_ and _Section 9.9_ , irrespective of the magnitude thereof,
the amount in dispute or whether such Dispute would otherwise be considered
justifiable or ripe for resolution by any court or arbitral tribunal, by
giving written notice thereof to the other Parties; provided, however, that in
no event shall a Party have the right to submit the Dispute to arbitration if
the institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such Dispute would
be barred by any applicable statute of limitations or _Section 9.1_.

  


 

  

(c) Any Dispute shall be settled exclusively and finally by binding
arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 9.8_ and
_Section 9.9_ ; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the provisions of
this _Section 9.8_ and _Section 9.9_ , Buyer and Seller may seek specific
performance of the provisions of this Agreement in a court of competent
jurisdiction (including _Section 5.15_ and _ARTICLE X_ ) in accordance with
_Section 11.12_ without first attempting to resolve such matter through
arbitration.

  


 

  

9.9 Arbitration Procedures.

  


 

  

(a) Any Party electing to arbitrate a Dispute shall designate its nomination
for an arbitrator in its notice to the other Party electing to submit the
Dispute to arbitration. Each Party receiving such notice shall, within 10
Business Days thereafter, by return written notice to all Parties, state
whether it will accept such nomination, or decline to accept it and designate
its nomination for an arbitrator. One arbitrator shall control the proceedings
if such nomination of an arbitrator is accepted by all Parties or if the
receiving Party fails to nominate an arbitrator within the required 10
Business Day period. If the receiving Party timely nominates an arbitrator,
the arbitral tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, with one arbitrator
being selected by Seller and one arbitrator being selected by Buyer, within
five Business Days after the expiration of the 10 Business Day period
reference above, and the two selected arbitrators choosing a third arbitrator,
which third arbitrator must be a Person with the requisite knowledge and
experience to make a fair and informed determination with respect to the
matter in dispute, which Person shall not be an Affiliate of any Party, nor an
employee, director, officer, shareholder, owner, partner, agent or a
contractor of any Party or of any Affiliate of any Party, either presently or
at any time during the previous two years. In the event the arbitrators fail
to appoint the third arbitrator within 30 days after they have accepted their
appointment, the third arbitrator (meeting the qualifications specified in the
preceding sentence) shall be appointed by the Houston office of the American
Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with
the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as
supplemented to the extent necessary to determine any procedural appeal
questions by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United Stated Code).
If there is an inconsistency between this _Section 9.9_ and the Commercial
Arbitration Rules or the Federal Arbitration Act, the provisions of this
_Section 9.9_ shall prevail.

  

  

 

56  

  

(b) Within 10 Business Days after the selection of the arbitrator(s), each
Party shall submit to the arbitrator(s) such Party's proposal for resolution
of the Dispute, which such proposal shall not conflict with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, together with the supporting data, if any, that
was used to determine such proposal. Within 30 days after the proposals are
submitted, the arbitrator(s) shall hold a hearing during which the Parties may
present evidence in support of their respective proposals. The arbitrator(s)
(by majority rule if there are three arbitrators) will determine the outcome
of the Dispute. The cost of the arbitration shall be split between the Parties
equally and each Party shall pay for one half of the costs.

  


 

  

(c) The place of arbitration shall be Houston, Texas, unless in any particular
case the Parties agree upon a different venue.

  


 

  

(d) The arbitrator(s) shall have no right or authority to grant or award Non-
Reimbursable Damages.

  


 

  

(e) Any decision of the arbitrator(s) pursuant to this _Section 9.9_ shall be
final and binding upon the Parties. The Parties agree that the arbitral award
may be enforced against the Parties to the arbitration proceeding or their
Assets wherever they may be found and that a judgment upon the arbitral award
may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction thereof. The Parties
expressly submit to the jurisdiction of any such court. The Parties hereby
waive, to the extent permitted by Law, any rights to appeal or to review of
such award by any court or tribunal.

  


 

  

(f) When any Dispute occurs and is the subject of friendly consultations or
arbitration, the Parties shall continue to make payments of undisputed amounts
in accordance with this Agreement, and the Parties shall otherwise continue to
exercise their rights and fulfill their respective obligations under this
Agreement. While any friendly consultations or arbitration is pending, no
Party shall exercise any other remedies hereunder arising by virtue of the
matters in Dispute.

  


 

  

9.10 Determination of Amount of Damages; Mitigation. The Losses giving rise to
any indemnification obligation hereunder shall be limited to the actual loss
suffered by the indemnified Person and shall be reduced by any insurance
proceeds or other payment or monetary recoupment actually received by the
indemnified Person as a result of the events giving rise to the claim for
indemnification. Any indemnified Person that becomes aware of Losses for which
it intends to seek indemnification hereunder shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to collect any amounts to which it may be entitled under insurance
policies or from third parties (pursuant to indemnification agreements or
otherwise) and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such
Losses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Buyer nor any Company shall
be required to pursue any claims against any customer of any Company or
against any employees of any Company; provided, however, that, to the extent
neither Buyer nor the Company choose to pursue any such claim, Seller shall
have full rights of substitution and subrogation to pursue any such claims
against such customers and/or employees with the same rights as if they were
Buyer and Buyer shall (and shall cause the Companies to) execute powers of
attorney, assignments or such other documents as reasonably requested to
permit Seller to exercise such rights.

  


 

  

9.11 Set Off. In addition to any right that a Buyer Indemnified Party may have
to seek payment for amounts owed to it under this _Article IX_ from the
Indemnity Escrow Account, Buyer may, to the extent provided in this Agreement,
set off any amount to which it or any Buyer Indemnified Party may otherwise be
entitled under this _Article IX_ against any amount otherwise payable to
Seller under this Agreement.

  

  

 

57  

  

ARTICLE X 
  Noncompetition Agreement

  


 

  

10.1 Noncompetition.

  


 

  

(a) As a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement, Seller
agrees that, for a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, Seller
will not, directly or indirectly, as an employee, agent, representative,
consultant, advisor, lender, independent contractor, principal, owner,
partner, joint venturer, member, manager, officer, director, shareholder or
otherwise, engage in or have any financial interest in any Person (other than
Buyer) engaged in the Business in the United States or in any other country in
which Seller or any of its Affiliates has conducted business within the three
(3) years preceding the Closing Date, including solicitation of customers, or
potential customers or employees of the Companies, except as an employee or
authorized representative of a Company or any of its affiliated entities,
provided that nothing in this _Section 10.1_ shall prevent Seller from owning
in the aggregate less than 1% of any publicly traded company.

  


 

  

(b) Seller acknowledges that any remedy at law will not adequately compensate
Buyer for damages resulting from a breach of this noncompetition agreement and
agree that Buyer may obtain injunctive relief against the breach or threatened
breach of this noncompetition agreement, in addition to any other legal
remedies which may be available.

  


 

  

(c) Seller and Buyer agree that the restrictions contained in _Section
10.1(a)_ are reasonable with respect to time, geographical area and scope of
activity. However, if any court shall determine that the time, geographical
area or scope of activity of any restriction contained in _Section 10.1(a)_ is
unenforceable, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction shall
not thereby be terminated but shall be deemed amended to the extent required
to render it valid and enforceable.

and contains the sole and entire agreement between the Parties and their
respective Affiliates hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  

  

 

59  

  

11.3 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each
Party shall pay its own costs and expenses incurred in anticipation of,
relating to and in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

11.4 Waiver. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time
by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver shall
be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on
behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No waiver by either Party

11.5 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified only
by a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of Seller and Buyer.

  


 

  

11.6 No Third Party Beneficiary. The terms and provisions of this Agreement
are intended solely for the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the Parties to
confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other Person.

  


 

  

11.7 Assignment; Binding Effect. Any Party may assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to an Affiliate but such assignment shall not release
such Party from its obligations hereunder. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, neither this Agreement nor any right, interest or obligation
hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of
the other Party, and any attempt to do so will be void, except for assignments
and transfers by operation of Law. Subject to this _Section 11.7_, this
Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is enforceable by the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  


 

  

11.8 Invalid Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the
rights or obligations of any Party under this Agreement will not be materially
and adversely affected thereby, such provision shall be fully severable, this
Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its
severance herefrom and in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a
legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

  


 

  

11.9 Counterparts; Facsimile. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any facsimile or PDF
copies hereof or signature hereon shall, for all purposes, be deemed
originals.

  

  

 

60  

  

11.10 Exclusive Remedy. In the absence of actual fraud, should the Closing
occur, the indemnification provisions in _Article IX_ will be the sole and
exclusive remedy and recourse for any breach of this Agreement by the Buyer or
the Seller, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. In addition, any
Party shall be entitled to seek specific performance against any other Party
pursuant to _Section 11.12_.

  


 

  

11.11 Governing Law; Enforcement, Jury Trial Waiver. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
GOVERNED, CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CONFLICT OR CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION
THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION'S LAW. THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF DELAWARE SHALL GOVERN ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, REMEDY OR CLAIM
BETWEEN THE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH
THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE EXISTENCE, VALIDITY, PERFORMANCE, OR BREACH
THEREOF. WITH RESPECT TO ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING THE ENFORCEMENT

AWARD, BUT WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE TERMS OF _SECTIONS 9.8_ AND _9.9_ , EACH
PARTY HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY.

  


 

  

11.12 Specific Performance. Each Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that the
rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are
special, unique and of extraordinary character and that, if any Party violates
or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by it herein,
the non-breaching Party may be without an adequate remedy at law. If any Party
violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by such
Party herein, the non-breaching Party subject to the terms hereof and in
addition to any remedy at law for damages or other relief, may (at any time
prior to the earlier of valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_ARTICLE VIII_ and Closing) institute and prosecute an action in any court of
competent jurisdiction to enforce specific performance of such covenant or
agreement or seek any other equitable relief.
