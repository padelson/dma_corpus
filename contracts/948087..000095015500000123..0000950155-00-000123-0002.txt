receipts or certificates provided for in said statutes certifying that (i) the
applicable obligations have been paid or discharged, at which time the

Sellers, or (ii) funds out of the Cash Component sufficient for such purpose are
held by the Escrow Agent as the Regulatory Holdback, at which time the Escrow
Agent shall pay such funds for such purpose and release the balance of the
Regulatory Holdback (if any) to Sellers. If Sellers do not produce such
receipts, certificates or evidence within the time periods provided for in said
statutes, or if any lien or other claim therefor is asserted against Purchaser
or the Real Property (or any portion thereof), the Escrow Agent may pay out of
the Regulatory Holdback such sums as may be required by such statutes to the

months from the Closing Date (the "FIRST HOLDBACK EXPIRATION DATE"), in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement Purchaser may apply the Purchaser's
Holdback to pay, or to provide for the payment of, any liability of Parent or
Sellers to Purchaser resulting from (i) post-Closing adjustments of the Cash
Component or (ii) Parent's and Sellers' indemnification obligations under
SECTION 11.01. On the First Holdback Expiration Date, any portion of the

the Escrow Account shall be released to Sellers in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement or, in the event of a pending dispute, as provided in the Escrow
Agreement (the "FIRST Release"). From time to time between the First Holdback
Expiration Date and the date which is 12 months from the First Holdback
Expiration Date (the "FINAL HOLDBACK EXPIRATION DATE"), in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement and after giving effect to the First Release, Purchaser may
apply the remaining balance of the Purchaser's Holdback to pay, or to provide
for the payment of, any liability of Parent or Sellers to Purchaser resulting
from Parent's and Seller's indemnification obligations under SECTION 11.01 only
as they pertain to breaches of representations and warranties contained in
SECTIONS 2.07 OR 2.14 or breaches of covenants contained in SECTIONS 8.01, 8.02
OR 8.03. On the Final Holdback Expiration Date, any portion of the Purchaser's
Holdback remaining in the Escrow Account shall be released to Sellers in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement or, in the event of a pending dispute, as
provided in the Escrow Agreement. There shall be added to each and every payment

            1.04 PURCHASE PRICE; ALLOCATION.

            (a) The aggregate purchase price for the Assets and the FSELLC
Membership Interest MINUS the credit given to Purchaser for its agreement to
license to Parent and its Affiliates (pursuant to the License Agreement) the
Intellectual Property that is being assigned to Purchaser under this Agreement
(the "PURCHASE PRICE") shall consist of the following:

                  (i)   One Hundred Forty Nine Million Dollars
      ($149,000,000), subject to adjustment as provided in SECTIONS 1.05,
      1.06 AND 1.07 (the "CASH COMPONENT"); plus

                  (ii)  Purchaser's assumption of the Assumed Liabilities.

            (b) Upon execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall pay Two
Million Dollars ($2,000,000) of the Cash Component as a deposit (the "EARNEST
MONEY DEPOSIT") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Deposit
Escrow Account maintained by the Deposit Escrow Agent at the address or to the
account number specified in the Deposit Escrow Agreement, with the balance of
the Cash Component (including the portions of the Cash Component constituting
the Regulatory Holdback and the Purchaser's Holdback) due at the Closing, as
provided in SECTION 1.08. Purchaser on one side, and Sellers on the other side,
shall each pay directly to the Deposit Escrow Agent one half of the Deposit
Escrow Fees as and when due under the Deposit Escrow Agreement.

            (c) Prior to the Closing Date Purchaser shall prepare a schedule
which sets forth an initial allocation of the Purchase Price among the Assets,
the FSELLC Membership Interest and the License Agreement credit and Purchaser
and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to determine the final allocation of
the Purchase Price among the Assets, the FSELLC Membership Interest and the
License Agreement credit. Such allocation shall be made separately for the
Assets from each of the Las Vegas Business, the Black Hawk Business and the
Tunica Business. If the parties are unable to agree upon an allocation of the
Purchase Price prior to the Closing, the parties shall continue to cooperate in
the preparation of, and use their reasonable best efforts to agree upon, the
allocation, provided that any material issues with respect to the allocation
which have not been finally resolved within 30 days following the Closing shall
be referred for resolution to a nationally recognized independent public
accounting firm as to which Sellers and Purchaser mutually agree, whose
determination shall be final and binding upon the parties. The costs of such
accounting firm shall be shared equally by Purchaser on one side, and by Sellers
on the other side. Any subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be
allocated in a manner consistent with the final Purchase Price allocation and
ss.1060 of the Code. Each party hereto agrees (i) that any such allocation shall
be consistent with PARAGRAPH (A) of this Section and the requirements of ss.1060
of the Code and the regulations thereunder, (ii) to complete jointly and to file
separately IRS Form 8594 as part of such party's Federal Income Tax Return
consistently with such allocation for the tax year in which the Closing occurs,
and (iii) that no party will take a position on any income, transfer or gains
Tax Return, before any Governmental or Regulatory Authority charged with the
collection of any Tax or in any judicial or administrative proceeding, that is

<PAGE>

in any manner inconsistent with the terms of any such allocation without the
written consent of the other parties unless required to do so pursuant to a
determination (as defined in ss.1313(a) of the Code or any similar provision of
applicable state, local or foreign law).

            1.05. WORKING CAPITAL/LONG TERM DEBT ADJUSTMENTS.

            (a) Set forth as EXHIBIT B hereto is a Balance Sheet as of July 2,
2000 (the "ADJUSTED BALANCE SHEET"). At the Closing, Parent will deliver to
Purchaser a Balance Sheet as of the end of Parent's most recently ended
four-/five-week accounting period preceding the Closing Date for which it is
then practicable to report the Business' results of operations (the "UPDATED
BALANCE SHEET"). Within 60 days after the Closing, Purchaser will deliver to
Parent a Balance Sheet as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date
(the "FINAL BALANCE SHEET"). The Updated Balance Sheet and the Final Balance
Sheet will be prepared as if FLV, FBH and FM are going concerns and on a basis
consistent with the Adjusted Balance Sheet, as provided in SECTION 2.04;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Updated Balance Sheet and the Final Balance Sheet
shall exclude all Retained Liabilities. As calculated in accordance with
PARAGRAPHS (B), (C) AND (D) of this Section, the respective differences between
(x) the "Adjusted Totals" of "Current Assets," "Current Liabilities" and "Long
Term Debt, Net" (which excludes intercompany debt) reported in the Updated
Balance Sheet and the Final Balance Sheet and (y) such amounts reported in the
Adjusted Balance Sheet will form the basis for dollar-for-dollar Closing and
post-Closing adjustments of the Cash Component. For purposes of calculating such
adjustments, "WORKING CAPITAL" means the amount by which the aggregate "Adjusted
Total" of "Current Assets" exceeds the aggregate "Adjusted Total" of "Current
Liabilities" reported on a Balance Sheet as of a specified date.

            (b) At the Closing, the Cash Component will be (i) increased by the
increase, if any, in Working Capital reported on the Updated Balance Sheet
("UPDATED WORKING CAPITAL") as compared to Working Capital reported on the
Adjusted Balance Sheet ("ADJUSTED WORKING CAPITAL") or (ii) reduced by the
decrease, if any, in Updated Working Capital as compared to Adjusted Working
Capital.

            (c) At the Closing, the Cash Component will be (i) increased by the
decrease, if any, in the aggregate "Adjusted Total" of "Long Term Debt, Net"
reported on the Updated Balance Sheet ("UPDATED LONG TERM DEBT") as compared to
the aggregate "Adjusted Total" of "Long Term Debt, Net" reported on the Adjusted
Balance Sheet ("ADJUSTED LONG TERM DEBT") or (ii) reduced by the increase, if
any, in Updated Long Term Debt as compared to Adjusted Long Term Debt.

            (d) Within a mutually agreed time period after Purchaser delivers
the Final Balance Sheet to Parent, but in no event later than ten days after any
disagreements with the Final Balance Sheet or the calculation of Final EBITDA
are resolved pursuant to SECTION 1.07, the following post-Closing adjustments to
the Cash Component will be made through either a cash payment by Purchaser to
Sellers in the case of a net increase in the Cash Component or a cash payment on
behalf of Sellers to Purchaser out of the Purchaser's Holdback in the case of a
net decrease in the Cash Component:

<PAGE>

                  (i)   The Cash Component will be (A) increased by the
      increase, if any, in Working Capital reported on the Final Balance
      Sheet ("FINAL WORKING CAPITAL") as compared to Updated Working Capital
      or (B) decreased by the decrease, if any, in Final Working Capital as
      compared to Updated Working Capital.

                  (ii)  The Cash Component will be decreased by the amount of
      any prepaid expenses or other current assets relating to the Business
      which are included in Final Working Capital, but are not transferable
      or assignable to Purchaser.

                  (iii) The Cash Component will be (A) increased by the
      decrease, if any, in the aggregate "Adjusted Total" of "Long Term Debt,
      Net" reported on the Final Balance Sheet ("FINAL LONG TERM DEBT") as
      compared to Updated Long Term Debt or (B) decreased by the increase, if
      any, in Final Long Term Debt as compared to Updated Long Term Debt.

            (e) The parties hereto acknowledge that Adjusted Working Capital
equals $2,941,895 and Adjusted Long Term Debt equals $158,878.

            1.06. EBITDA Adjustments.

            (a) At the Closing, Parent will deliver to Purchaser the EBITDA
Financial Statements prepared internally by Parent for the 12-month period
ending on the last day of Parent's last four-/five-week accounting period
preceding the Closing Date for which it is then practicable to report the
Business' results of operations (the "INTERIM EBITDA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS").
Within 60 days after the Closing and together with the Final Balance Sheet,
Purchaser will deliver to Parent the EBITDA Financial Statements for the
12-month period ending on the last day of Parent's last four-/five-week
accounting period preceding the Closing Date (the "FINAL EBITDA FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS"). The Interim EBITDA Financial Statements and the Final EBITDA
Financial Statements will be prepared as if FLV, FBH and FM are going concerns
and on a basis consistent with the manner in which Purchaser, Parent and Sellers
mutually calculated Benchmark EBITDA for the Business for purposes of this
Agreement. As calculated in accordance with PARAGRAPHS (B) AND (C) of this
Section, the respective variances between Adjusted EBITDA and Benchmark EBITDA,
and between Final EBITDA and Benchmark EBITDA, will form the basis for Closing
and post-Closing adjustments of the Cash Component.

            (b) If EBITDA as reported on the Interim EBITDA Financial Statements
PLUS the Corporate Expense Adjustment ("ADJUSTED EBITDA") varies by more than 5%
from $30,400,000 ("BENCHMARK EBITDA"), then the Cash Component will be adjusted
at the Closing by an amount ("INTERIM ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT") equal to the product
of (x) Adjusted EBITDA MINUS Benchmark EBITDA, multiplied by (y) four. The Cash
Component will be reduced by a negative Interim Adjustment Amount or increased
by a positive Interim Adjustment Amount, as the case may be. No Cash Component
adjustment will be made under this PARAGRAPH (B) if Adjusted EBITDA does not
vary by more than 5% from Benchmark EBITDA.

<PAGE>

            (c) Within a mutually agreed time period after Purchaser delivers
the Final EBITDA Financial Statements to Parent, but in no event later than ten
days after any disagreements with the Final Balance Sheet or the calculation of
Final EBITDA are resolved pursuant to SECTION 1.07, the following post-Closing
adjustments to the Cash Component will be made through either a cash payment by
Purchaser to Sellers in the case of an increase in the Cash Component or a cash
payment on behalf of Sellers to Purchaser out of the Purchaser's Holdback in the
case of a decrease in the Cash Component:

                  (i)   If EBITDA as reported on the Final EBITDA Financial
      Statements PLUS the Corporate Expense Adjustment ("FINAL EBITDA")
      varies by more than 5% from Benchmark EBITDA, then the Cash Component
      will be adjusted by an amount ("FINAL ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT") equal to (I)
      the product of (x) Final EBITDA minus Benchmark EBITDA, multiplied by
      (y) four, MINUS (II) the Interim EBITDA Adjustment Amount.  The Cash
      Component will be reduced by a negative Final Adjustment Amount or
      increased by a positive Final Adjustment Amount, as the case may be.

                  (ii)  If Final EBITDA does not vary by more than 5% from
      Benchmark EBITDA, then the only Cash Component adjustment that shall be
      made pursuant to CLAUSE (I) of this PARAGRAPH (C) shall be a reversal
      of the Cash Component adjustment that was made under PARAGRAPH (B) of
      this Section based on the Interim Adjustment Amount, with a
      reimbursement by the party that received the payment for such
      adjustment.

            1.07. POST-CLOSING AUDIT AND ADJUSTMENT. Parent will have the right
to review or audit the Final Balance Sheet and the calculation of Final EBITDA.
Any appropriate corrections or restatements resulting from such review or audit
that affect the Cash Component adjustments specified in SECTION 1.05 or SECTION
1.06 will require a corresponding cash payment by Purchaser to Sellers in the
case of an increase in the Cash Component, or reimbursement by or on behalf of
Sellers to Purchaser in the case of a reduction of the Cash Component. If Parent
disagrees with the Final Balance Sheet or with the calculation of Final EBITDA,
it shall notify Purchaser of such disagreement in writing, specifying in detail
the particulars of such disagreement, within 15 Business Days after Parent's
receipt of the Final Balance Sheet and calculation of Final EBITDA (the "DISPUTE
NOTICE"). To the extent that any portion of the Final Balance Sheet or
calculation of Final EBITDA is not in dispute, within 15 Business Days after
Parent's receipt of the Final Balance Sheet and the calculation of Final EBITDA,
Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid to Purchaser or Purchaser shall pay or
cause to be paid to Sellers, as the case may be, that portion of the adjustment
to the Cash Component which is not in dispute. Any such payment owed by Sellers
shall be made from the Purchaser's Holdback as provided in SECTION 1.03(B), to
the extent that the Purchaser's Holdback is sufficient for that purpose.
Purchaser and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of
30 days after Parent's delivery of the Dispute Notice (or such longer period as
Purchaser and Sellers mutually agree upon) to resolve any disagreements raised
by Parent with respect to the Final Balance Sheet or the calculation of Final
EBITDA. If, at the end of such period, Purchaser and Sellers are unable to
resolve such disagreements, Deloitte & Touche and Price Waterhouse Coopers,
independent auditors of Sellers and Purchaser, respectively, shall jointly
select a third independent auditor from a recognized national standing "Big-5"
accounting firm to resolve any remaining disagreements. The determination by
such third independent auditor shall be final, binding and conclusive on

<PAGE>

Purchaser, Parent and Sellers. Purchaser and Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such third independent auditor to make its
determination within 30 days of accepting its selection. If Parent or any
Sellers determine that a delay in this dispute resolution mechanism threatens to
delay the closing of their cases in the Bankruptcy Proceedings, then Parent or
any Sellers may seek means from the Bankruptcy Court to enforce such independent
auditor's determination. The parties hereto, Sellers' and Purchaser's respective
independent auditors, and such third selected independent auditor shall agree to
be subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court for this purpose. Within
ten days after the date of determination of such third independent auditor,
Purchaser shall pay Sellers, or Sellers shall pay Purchaser, as the case may be,
the amount of the adjustment to the Cash Component that is determined to be due
and payable. Any such payment owed by Sellers shall be made from the Purchaser's
Holdback as provided in SECTION 1.03(B), to the extent that the Purchaser's
Holdback is sufficient for that purpose. Fees and expenses of such third
independent auditor shall be borne equally by Purchaser on one side, and Sellers
on the other side.

            1.08. CLOSING; ESCROW.

            (a) The Closing will commence at the office of Parent in Las Vegas,
Nevada, or at such other place as the parties hereto mutually agree in writing,
at 9:00 a.m. Nevada time, on the Closing Date and shall be deemed to have
occurred for each of the Las Vegas Business, the Black Hawk Business and the
Tunica Business at 11:59 p.m., Nevada time, on the Closing Date (the "TRANSFER
TIME"), giving effect, retroactively to the Transfer Time, to tabulations of
Assets, Liabilities and income and expense amounts allocable to Sellers for the
period prior to the Transfer Time that will commence at 1:00 a.m., local time at
the respective Business locations on the day after the Closing Date.

            (b) At the Closing, Purchaser will deliver the Cash Component (less
the Earnest Money Deposit), as adjusted pursuant to SECTIONS 1.05(B) AND (C) AND
1.06(B), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Escrow Account
maintained by the Escrow Agent at the address or to the account number specified
in the Escrow Agreement. The Cash Component, MINUS the Regulatory Holdback,
MINUS the Purchaser's Holdback, MINUS one half of the Escrow Fees, plus all
interest earned on the Earnest Money Deposit shall then be released from the
Escrow Account and the Deposit Escrow Account and paid to Sellers simultaneously
with the actions specified in PARAGRAPH (D) of this Section. Also at the
Closing, one half of the Escrow Fees shall be paid to the Escrow Agent from the
Cash Component and the other half of the Escrow Fees shall be paid directly by
Purchaser to the Escrow Agent.

            (c) The Regulatory Holdback and the Purchaser's Holdback shall
remain in the Escrow Account and shall be applied against the obligations
specified in PARAGRAPHS (A) AND (B), respectively, of SECTION 1.03 during the
applicable periods specified therein, in accordance with SECTION 1.03 and the
Escrow Agreement. Upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in SECTION
1.03(A), any remaining balance of the Regulatory Holdback plus all interest
earned on the Regulatory Holdback shall be released from the Escrow Account and
paid immediately to Sellers. On the First Holdback Expiration Date, any
remaining balance of the Purchaser's Holdback in excess of $1,000,000 shall be
released from the Escrow Account and paid immediately to Sellers unless a
dispute is pending, in which case the Escrow Agreement shall govern. On the

<PAGE>

Final Holdback Expiration Date, any remaining balance of the Purchaser's
Holdback shall be released from the Escrow Account and paid immediately to
Sellers unless a dispute is pending, in which case the Escrow Agreement shall
govern.  There shall be added to each and every payment out of the
Purchaser's Holdback a proportionate share of the interest earned on the
Purchaser's Holdback through the date of such payment.

            (d) Simultaneously with the remittance by Purchaser of the Cash
Component (less the Earnest Money Deposit) to the Escrow Account pursuant to
PARAGRAPH (B) of this Section, (i) Sellers will, and Parent will cause Sellers
to, assign and transfer to Purchaser all of Sellers' rights, title and interests
in and to the Assets (free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens)
and FFEC will assign and transfer to Purchaser the FSELLC Membership Interest by
delivery of (A) General Assignments and Bills of Sale substantially in the form
of EXHIBIT C hereto (the "GENERAL ASSIGNMENTS"), duly executed by Sellers, (B)
grant, bargain and sale deeds (or the substantial equivalent thereof in Colorado
and Mississippi if grant, bargain and sale deeds are not used in those
jurisdictions) in proper statutory form for recording and otherwise in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, conveying title to the Real
Property, (C) the documentation required by the FSELLC Organizational Documents,
duly executed by FFEC, for the transfer of the FSELLC Membership Interest to
Purchaser, and (D) subject to SECTION 1.12, such other instruments of
conveyance, assignment and transfer, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Purchaser, as shall be effective to vest in Purchaser all of Sellers' rights,
title and interests in and to the Assets and all of FFEC's rights, title and
interest in and to the FSELLC Membership Interest (the General Assignments and
the other instruments referred to in SUB-CLAUSES (B), (C) AND (D) of this CLAUSE
(I) are collectively referred to herein as the "ASSIGNMENT INSTRUMENTS"), and
(ii) Purchaser will assume from Sellers the due payment, performance and
discharge of the Assumed Liabilities and will acquire and accept from FFEC the
FSELLC Membership Interest by delivery of (A) an Assumption Agreement
substantially in the form of EXHIBIT D hereto (the "ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT"), duly
executed by Purchaser, (B) such other instruments of assumption, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Sellers and Parent, as shall be effective to
cause Purchaser to assume the Assumed Liabilities as provided in SECTION
1.02(A), and (C) the documentation required by the FSELLC Organizational
Documents, duly executed by Purchaser, for Purchaser's acquisition of all of
FFEC's rights, title and interest in and to the FSELLC Membership Interest (the
Assumption Agreement and such other instruments referred to in SUB-CLAUSES (B)
AND (C) of this CLAUSE (III) are collectively referred to herein as the
"ASSUMPTION INSTRUMENTS"). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
PARAGRAPH (D) regarding the FSELLC Membership Interest, the parties' respective
obligations in this regard are subject to the provisions of SECTION 1.14 . If
the consents specified in SECTION 1.14 have not been obtained prior to the
Closing Date, this Agreement shall not require the transfer of the FSELLC
Membership Interest to, or the acquisition of the FSELLC Membership Interest by,
Purchaser at the Closing.

            (e) At the Closing, there shall also be delivered to Sellers, Parent
and Purchaser the certificates and other contracts, documents and instruments
required to be delivered under ARTICLES VI AND VII.

            1.09. "AS IS" CONDITION. Except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement to the contrary, all of the Assets are being sold to Purchaser

<PAGE>

in "as is" condition, and neither Sellers nor Parent make any representations
or warranties of any kind and disclaim any and all implied warranties with
respect to any of the Assets.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that: (a) neither Sellers nor
Parent make any representation or warranty with respect to the
transferability of any Assets other than the Real Property, Improvements,
Real Property Leases, Tangible Personal Property, Intangible Personal
Property, Vehicles, Advance Reservation Deposits, Customer Lists, and
Business Books and Records or of the FSELLC Membership Interest; (b)
Purchaser has been given an adequate opportunity to make such investigations
as Purchaser deemed appropriate with respect to the Business and the Assets;
and (c) Purchaser has been provided with the Title Reports, has reviewed the
Title Reports, and has knowledge of all easements, restrictions and other
exceptions to title of record.

            1.10 FURTHER ASSURANCES; POST-CLOSING COOPERATION.

            (a) From time to time after the Closing, at Purchaser's request and
without further consideration, Sellers shall, and Parent shall cause Sellers to,
execute and deliver to Purchaser such other instruments of sale, transfer,
conveyance, assignment and confirmation, provide such materials and information
and take such other actions consistent with this Agreement as Purchaser may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order more effectively to transfer,
convey and assign to Purchaser, and to confirm Purchaser's title to, the Assets
and, to the full extent permitted by Law, to put Purchaser in actual possession
and operating control of the Business and the Assets and to assist Purchaser in
exercising all rights with respect thereto, and otherwise to cause Sellers to
fulfill their obligations under this Agreement and the Operative Agreements.

            (b) Following the Closing, each party will afford the other parties,
their counsel and their accountants, during normal business hours, reasonable
access to the books, records and other data relating to the Business in its
possession with respect to periods prior to the Closing and the right to make
copies and extracts therefrom, to the extent that such access may be reasonably
required by the requesting party in connection with (i) the preparation of Tax
Returns, (ii) the determination or enforcement of rights or obligations under
this Agreement, (iii) compliance with the requirements of any Governmental or
Regulatory Authority, (iv) the determination or enforcement of the rights or
obligations of any party to this Agreement or any of the Operative Agreements or
(v) in connection with any actual or threatened Action or Proceeding. Each party
further agrees for a period of five years commencing on the Closing Date not to
destroy or otherwise dispose of any such books, records and other data unless
such party first offers in writing to surrender such books, records and other
data to the other parties and such other parties do not agree in writing to take
possession thereof within ten days after such offer is made.

            (c) If, in order to properly prepare its Tax Returns, other
documents or reports required to be filed with Governmental or Regulatory
Authorities or its financial statements or to fulfill its obligations hereunder,
a party needs to be furnished with additional information, documents or records
relating to the Business not referred to in PARAGRAPH (b) of this Section, and
such information, documents or records are in the possession or control of
another party hereto, such other party shall make its best efforts to furnish or
make available such information, documents or records (or copies thereof) at the
recipient's request, cost and expense.

<PAGE>

            (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, if the
parties are in an adversarial relationship in litigation or arbitration, the
furnishing of information, documents or records shall be governed by applicable
rules relating to discovery, rather than by PARAGRAPHS (B) AND (C) of this
Section.

            (e) Each of Sellers and Purchaser acknowledge that if any of the
Sellers shall fail to take, or cause to be taken, any such action, fail to do,
or cause to be done, any such thing, or fail to execute any such documents,
instruments or conveyances within a reasonable time as reasonably requested by
Purchaser, Purchaser may move the Bankruptcy Court for an order directing the
provision of such items on an emergency basis upon not less than five Business
Days' notice by telecopy or other electronic facsimile transmission received by
Sellers. Sellers agree not to oppose the scheduling of a hearing relating to
such a motion on the basis of shortened notice or method of notice, provided
Sellers are permitted to appear at such hearing telephonically. Sellers and
Purchaser further agree that the Bankruptcy Court shall retain jurisdiction to
adjudicate any such motion of Purchaser.

            1.11. INSURANCE PROCEEDS. If prior to the Closing any Assets are
destroyed, damaged or taken in condemnation, the insurance proceeds or
condemnation award, or any transferable or assignable claim for insurance
proceeds or condemnation award with respect thereto shall constitute an Asset.
At the Closing, Sellers shall, and Parent shall cause Sellers to, pay or credit
to Purchaser any such insurance proceeds or condemnation awards received by any
of them on or prior to the Closing and shall assign to or assert for the benefit
of Purchaser all of their rights against any insurance companies, Governmental
or Regulatory Authorities and others with respect to such damage, destruction or
condemnation.

            1.12. THIRD-PARTY CONSENT. To the extent that any Real Property
Lease, Business Contract or Business License is not assignable pursuant to the
Bankruptcy Code or otherwise without the consent of another party, this
Agreement shall not constitute an assignment or an attempted assignment thereof
if such assignment or attempted assignment would constitute a violation or
breach thereof or a default thereunder. Parent and Sellers shall make
commercially reasonable efforts (including, without limitation, prosecution of
appropriate motions pursuant to ss.365 of the Bankruptcy Code) to obtain the
consent of such other party to the assignment to Purchaser of any such Real
Property Lease, Business Contract or Business License in all cases in which such
consent is or may be required; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that to obtain any such
consent, Parent and Sellers shall not be required to pay or incur more than
nominal expenses plus (i) amounts required to cure any defaults under the Real
Property Lease, Business Contract or Business License in question; and (ii)
reasonable attorneys' fees. If any such consent is not obtained, Parent and
Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser in any reasonable arrangement designed to
provide for Purchaser the benefits intended to be assigned to Purchaser under
the relevant Real Property Lease, Business Contract or Business License,
including enforcement at the cost and for the account of Purchaser of any and
all rights of Sellers against the other party thereto arising out of the breach
or cancellation thereof by such other party or otherwise. If and to the extent
that such arrangement cannot be made, Purchaser shall have no obligation with
respect to any such Real Property Lease, Business Contract or Business License.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, Purchaser shall be obligated to

<PAGE>

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement if the condition to
its obligations hereunder contained in SECTION 6.05 has been fulfilled.

            1.13. BLACK HAWK BUSINESS EXPANSION. No adjustment will be made to
the Purchase Price for any costs incurred by or on behalf of Purchaser in
connection with securing or acquiring entitlements necessary for the
contemplated expansion of the Black Hawk Business. Sellers shall have no
obligation to secure or acquire any such entitlements or incur any costs or
expend any amounts in connection with such proposed expansion.

            1.14. FSELLC MEMBERSHIP INTEREST. The parties hereto acknowledge
that although a transfer of the FSELLC Membership Interest to Purchaser is an
appropriate incident to Purchaser's acquisition of the Las Vegas Business, such
transfer is subject to the prior consent of members of FSELLC and Purchaser's
agreement to be bound by the terms of the FSELLC Organizational Documents, as
provided therein. FLV, FFEC and Purchaser covenant to make commercially
reasonable efforts to satisfy all conditions and obtain all consents required to
transfer the FSELLC Membership Interest to Purchaser at the Closing. If,
notwithstanding such commercially reasonable efforts, any required conditions
have not been satisfied or any required consents have not been obtained by the
Closing Date, this Agreement shall not require the FSELLC Membership Interest to
be transferred to Purchaser at the Closing; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that FLV, FFEC
and Purchasers shall continue to make commercially reasonable efforts from and
after the Closing Date to satisfy such conditions, obtain such consents and
effect such transfer as soon thereafter as practicable.

                                  ARTICLE II

             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SELLERS

Seller relate, refer or pertain to the Bankruptcy Code or any aspect of the
Bankruptcy Proceedings, as to matters involving the Bankruptcy Code or the
Bankruptcy Proceedings such representations and warranties are not effective
until commencement of the Bankruptcy Proceedings and do not apply to any period
prior to such commencement. To the extent that any representations or warranties
by Parent or any Seller relate, refer or pertain to the transfer of the FSELLC
Membership Interest to Purchaser, such representations and warranties are made
only as of the Closing Date.

Condition of the Business.

            2.07. TAXES.

SECTION 2.07(A) OF THE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE, Parent, each Seller and FFEC have

            4.08. NON-COMPETITION.

            (a) Provided that the Restructuring Agreement has not been
terminated prior to or within 30 days after the Petition Date and except as
permitted in this SECTION 4.08, during the period commencing on the Closing Date
and ending on the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date with respect to the
following CLAUSES (I) AND (II) and ending on the 12-month anniversary of the
Closing Date with respect to the following CLAUSE (III), Parent, Sellers, Philip
D. Griffith, Michael E. McPherson, Max L. Page and Paul H. Manske (collectively,
the "SUBJECT PARTIES") each agree not to, directly or indirectly through any of
their present or future Affiliates, (i) engage in the operation of any Competing
Business (as defined in PARAGRAPH (E) of this Section) within Downtown Las Vegas
(as defined in PARAGRAPH (E) of this Section) or within a 75-mile radius of the
Black Hawk Business or the Tunica Business (in each case, a "TERRITORY," and
collectively, the "TERRITORIES"), (ii) acquire, lease, be a controlling owner,

<PAGE>

controlling shareholder, controlling partner, controlling member or controlling
equity holder of, exercise management control over, provide consulting services
for, or acquire or maintain a controlling interest in, any Competing Business
that is located in any of the Territories or (iii), except as provided in
PARAGRAPH (B) of this Section, hire, seek to hire, or recommend or solicit the
hiring of, any Employees who are hired by Purchaser as of the Closing or
encourage any of such Persons to terminate their employment with Purchaser
unless Purchaser has first terminated such Persons' employment. This SECTION
4.08 shall continue to apply to Parent and each Seller if any of them are
acquired by or merged with or into any other Person who owns or operates a
Competing Business (provided that the Restructuring Agreement has not been
terminated prior to or within 30 days after the Petition Date), but shall not
apply to the Competing Business (including Persons who own or operate the
Competing Business). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this SECTION 4.08 shall not
apply to any Person who succeeds to a substantial portion of Parent's or any
Seller's or any of their Affiliates' assets. As used herein, "controlling" means
having possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through ownership
of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

            (b) The obligations of the Subject Parties specified in clause (iii)
of PARAGRAPH (A) of this Section regarding Employees shall not apply to hiring
such Employees for other than hotel or casino employment. Furthermore, such
obligations shall not apply to any business establishments in which Philip D.
Griffith, Michael E. McPherson, Max L. Page or Paul H. Manske are employed or to
which they provide services after the Closing Date if such establishments are
not, directly or indirectly, under the control of the Subject Parties (however,
the obligations will be applicable to these four individuals even if not
applicable to the business establishments).

            (c) Each Subject Party recognizes that the covenants in this SECTION
4.08 and the territorial, time and other limitations with respect thereto are
reasonable and properly required for the adequate protection of the acquisition
of the Assets by Purchaser, and agrees that such limitations are reasonable with
respect to its activities, business and public purpose. Each Subject Party
agrees and acknowledges that the violation of the covenants or agreements in
this SECTION 4.08 would cause irreparable injury to Purchaser and that the
remedy at law for any violation or threatened violation thereof would be
inadequate and that, in addition to whatever other remedies may be available
against the violating Subject Party at law or in equity, Purchaser shall be
entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive or other equitable relief against
the violating Subject Party without the necessity of proving actual damages or
posting bond. Each Subject Party also waives any requirement of proving actual
damages in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other
equitable relief.

            (d) Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent or limit the right of
any Subject Party or any of its Affiliates to engage in any of the activities
otherwise prohibited by CLAUSE (I) OR (II) OF PARAGRAPH (A) of this Section if
the applicable Competing Business is being constructed, operated, leased, owned,
managed or consulted to by any Subject Party or its Affiliates as of the Closing
Date (after giving effect to the sale of Assets contemplated hereby). In

<PAGE>

addition, the covenants in PARAGRAPH (A) of this Section will not apply to (x)
any Persons or hotel or casino assets or facilities that cease to be owned,
directly or indirectly, by Parent or any Seller, including hotel or casino
assets or facilities that may be divested or spun off by any Subject Party or
any of its Affiliates, (y) any services (including consulting services) provided
by or on behalf of any Subject Party to (I) any such Person or assets or
facilities referred to in CLAUSE (X) above or (II) any Persons in which any
Subject Party or its Affiliates have, directly or indirectly, any minority
ownership interest or (z) reasonable expansions and extensions of existing
exempt operations of the type referred to in this PARAGRAPH (D).

            (e) It is the intention of each party hereto that the provisions of
this Section shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws
and the public policies of the States of Colorado, Mississippi and Nevada,
respectively, and of any other jurisdiction in which enforcement may be sought,
but that the unenforceability (or the modification to conform with such laws or
public policies) of any provisions hereof shall not render unenforceable or
impair the remainder of this Agreement. Accordingly, if any term or provision of
this Section is determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, either in
whole or in part, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to delete or modify, as
necessary, the offending provisions and to alter the balance of this Agreement
in order to render the same valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permissible as aforesaid.

            (f) For purposes of this SECTION 4.08, "COMPETING BUSINESS" means
the business of owning or operating one or more establishments conducting a
"gaming" (as defined in NRS ss.463.0153) or race book or sports book business,
and "DOWNTOWN LAS VEGAS" means the area commonly known as Downtown Las Vegas,
which consists of the area of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada bounded by Stewart
Avenue on the north, Bridger Avenue on the south, Sixth Street on the east and
Main Street on the west.

            (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this
SECTION 4.08 shall be of no force or effect if the Restructuring Agreement has
been terminated prior to or within 30 days after the Petition Date.

            4.09. TITLE INSURANCE POLICIES AND EXCEPTIONS.

            (a) EXHIBIT F hereto contains preliminary title reports for the Real
Property and the Real Property Leases (the "TITLE REPORTS"). All title
exceptions shown on the Title Reports are hereinafter referred to as the
"PERMITTED EXCEPTIONS." The Permitted Exceptions shall also include those other
title exceptions which are disclosed or become apparent to Purchaser after the
date hereof, which are not already Permitted Exceptions, which cannot be removed
by the payment of a sum of money, which are not caused by the intentional act of
a Seller or any Affiliate of a Seller after the date hereof, and which do not
materially adversely affect the value of the Real Property or Improvements, or
the continued use thereof as currently conducted, or as to which Purchaser has
not timely objected.

            (b) Sellers shall cause all title exceptions shown on the Title
Reports (other than Permitted Exceptions) not approved by Purchaser to be
removed on or before the Closing. Sellers, however, shall have the right to (i)
cause the Title Companies to remove any Liens by bonding over such Liens

<PAGE>

or (ii) obtain the commitment of the appropriate Title Companies to insure
Purchaser against loss or damage that may be occasioned by such exceptions
that are not Permitted Exceptions.

            (c) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall obtain ALTA extended
owner's policies of title insurance covering the Real Property owned by any
Seller (the "OWNED REAL PROPERTY") and lessee's policies of title insurance
covering Real Property in which any Seller has a leasehold interest (the "LEASED
REAL PROPERTY") (Forms B-1970) (Amended 4-6-90), with gap coverage for any Real
Property that will be conveyed to Purchaser at the Closing before the
corresponding deeds or Real Property Leases are recorded with the appropriate
local recording office, issued by title insurance companies reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers in their respective reasonable discretion
(the "TITLE COMPANIES"), insuring that Purchaser has fee title to the Owned Real
Property and Improvements thereon and valid leasehold interests in the Leased
Real Property and Improvements thereon, subject only to (i) the Permitted
Exceptions, (ii) liens for taxes not yet due and payable, (iii) all standard
exceptions, exclusions, conditions and stipulations from coverage for the Title
Companies' Extended Coverage Form ALTA Owner's Policy of Title Insurance or
Lessee's Policy of Title Insurance, as the case may be, including any and all
endorsements (excluding zoning endorsements) and affirmative coverage customary
in real estate sale transactions involving the magnitude and type of the Assets
as Purchaser shall reasonably request, and (iv) those exceptions arising after
the Transfer Time and approved by Purchaser as provided above (the "TITLE
Policies"). The aggregate coverage amount of the Title Policies for the Real
Property and Improvements shall be the Purchase Price.

            (d) Sellers and Purchaser shall share equally the cost of the
premiums for the Title Policies and the endorsements up to the aggregate
coverage amount specified in paragraph (c) of this Section and the cost of the
surveys specified in PARAGRAPH (E) of this Section. Sellers and Purchaser shall
cooperate diligently to provide customary documents required by the Title
Companies as condition to the issuance of the Title Policies.

            (e) If reasonably required in order for Purchaser to obtain the
Title Policies, Sellers shall order surveys to be prepared and be certified as
having been prepared in accordance with "Minimum Standard Detail Requirements
for ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys" jointly established and adopted by the ALTA
and ACSM in 1997 and including all ALTA optional items except No. 5 (Contour
Maps) and No. 12 (Governmental Agency Survey Requirements). Any such surveys
shall include a certification as to whether any of the Real Property and
Improvements are located in a floodplain or designated floodway and such
information as may be required by any of the Title Companies to issue extended
coverage (consistent with all matters shown on the survey) over all general
printed exceptions to title.

            4.10. NOTICE AND CURE. Sellers shall notify, and Parent shall cause
Sellers to notify, Purchaser in writing (where appropriate, through updates to
the Disclosure Schedule) of, and contemporaneously will provide Purchaser with
true and complete copies of any and all information or documents relating to,
and will use all commercially reasonable efforts to cure before the Closing, any
development, event, transaction or circumstance occurring after the date of this
Agreement that causes any covenant or agreement of Parent or Sellers under this
Agreement to be breached in any material respect or that renders untrue in any
material respect any representation or warranty of Parent or Sellers contained

<PAGE>

in this Agreement as if the same were made on or as of the date of such
development, event, transaction or circumstance. The notification required by
this Section (the "DEVELOPMENT NOTIFICATION") shall be given to Purchaser within

each Operative Agreement that Parent or Sellers are required hereby to execute
and deliver as a condition to the Closing, shall take all commercially
reasonable steps necessary or desirable and proceed diligently and in good faith
to satisfy each other condition to the obligations of Purchaser contained in
this Agreement and will not take or fail to take any action that could
reasonably be expected to result in the nonfulfillment of any such condition.
This Agreement shall not obligate Parent or Sellers collectively to incur more
than $50,000 of costs and expenses to satisfy the conditions specified in
SECTION 6.09; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that regardless of the amount of costs and
expenses necessary to satisfy the conditions specified in SECTION 6.09.

indicating the check number applicable thereto; and (iii) deliver the
Inventoried Baggage to an authorized representative of Purchaser and secure a

for such Inventoried Baggage.

            4.13. SAFE DEPOSITS. On or before the Transfer Time, Sellers shall
remove, and Parent shall cause Sellers to remove, all items stored by any
Seller, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates in safe deposit boxes
located at the Property, and all such safe deposit boxes shall be made available
for Purchaser's use thereafter. Safe deposit boxes in use by customers at the
Property at the Transfer Time will be sealed in a reasonable manner mutually
agreeable to Purchaser and Sellers. At the Transfer Time, Purchaser and Sellers
shall designate in writing their initial safe deposit representatives.
Representatives of both Sellers and Purchaser are to be present when a seal is
broken. Sellers will make a representative available within one (1) hour after
Purchaser notifies Sellers that the representative is required. Purchaser shall
have no responsibility for loss or theft from a safe deposit box whose seal was
broken in the presence of Sellers' representatives. All safe deposit keys,
combinations and records shall be delivered at the Transfer Time to Purchaser.

            4.14. VALET PARKING. At the Transfer Time, authorized

Development Notification with respect to a development, event, transaction or
circumstance that causes a breach of any of their respective representations and
warranties in SECTIONS 2.04 THROUGH 2.11, 2.16, 2.18 AND 2.19, then unless
Purchaser has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to SECTION 12.01(C)
by reason thereof and exercises that right within 30 days after such Development
Notification is given, such Development Notification will be deemed to have
amended the Disclosure Schedule, to have qualified the representations and
warranties contained in SECTIONS 2.04 THROUGH 2.11, 2.16, 2.18 AND 2.19, and to
have cured any misrepresentation or breach of representation or warranty that
otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of such development, event,
transaction or occurrence.

Knowledge of Purchaser, occurring after the date of this Agreement that causes
any covenant or agreement of Purchaser under this Agreement to be breached or
that renders untrue in any material respect any representation or warranty of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement as if the same were made on or as of the
date of such event, transaction or circumstance. No notice given pursuant to
this Section shall have any effect on the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement for purposes of determining

waived).

Closing Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this condition shall not apply to the
extent that ARTICLE IV or other provisions of this Agreement authorize Parent or
Sellers to take certain actions or authorize certain events to occur between the

by Purchaser for their periods of employment with any Sellers through the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date for purposes of determining seniority and
eligibility for employee benefits (other than pension plans) provided generally
by Purchaser's Parent or subsidiaries of Purchaser's Parent to their employees
performing the same or substantially similar duties. For at least 90 days after
the Closing, Purchaser shall not, directly or indirectly, take any actions that

specified in CLAUSES (I) AND (II), at the Las Vegas Business, the Black Hawk
Business or the Tunica Business to incur an "EMPLOYMENT LOSS," as defined in
SECTION 9.03:

                  (i)   The greater of (A) 49 or (B) 32.9% of all Covered

            (b)   For the period between the Closing Date and the end of the
calendar year in which the Closing takes place, Purchaser shall adopt and
maintain in effect the Bonus Plan for Employees that Purchaser hires pursuant
to PARAGRAPH (A) of this Section.

            (c) From time to time after the execution of this Agreement, Sellers
shall be entitled to notify Employees of Purchaser's obligations under
PARAGRAPHS (A) AND (B) of this Section.

            9.02. PURPOSE AND INTENT. The provisions of this ARTICLE IX are
intended to, among other things, effect a smooth transition of the ownership of
the Business from Sellers to Purchaser and of the employment of the Employees
such that in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Employees at each of the three Business locations will not be deemed to have
incurred an Employment Loss for which any Sellers had or will have obligations,
Liabilities or responsibilities under WARN. Purchaser shall perform its
obligations under this ARTICLE IX in a spirit of cooperation and utmost good
faith with a view towards achieving this intent.

            9.03. CERTAIN DEFINED TERMS. For purposes of this ARTICLE IX, the
following terms have the following meanings:

            (a) "COVERED EMPLOYEES" means all Employees other than "part-time
employees," as defined under WARN.

            (b) "EMPLOYMENT LOSS" has the meaning ascribed to such term under
WARN.

            9.04. ENFORCEMENT OF OBLIGATIONS. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that a violation of any covenants or agreements in this ARTICLE IX would cause
irreparable injury to Parent, Sellers and their Affiliates and that the remedy
at law for any violation or threatened violation thereof would be inadequate and
that, in addition to whatever other remedies may be available at law or in
equity, Parent and Sellers shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
injunctive or other equitable relief without the necessity of proving actual
damages or posting bond. Purchaser also waives any requirement of proving actual
damages in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other
equitable relief.

            9.05. EXCEPTION TO HIRING OBLIGATIONS. This ARTICLE IX shall not
require Purchaser to hire any Employees who freely and voluntarily choose not to
be employed by Purchaser, so long as Purchaser has neither taken actions nor
expressed an intention to take actions with respect to such Employees that would
reasonably be expected to cause such Employees to incur an Employment Loss if
they were to accept employment by Purchaser. This SECTION 9.05 shall not,
however, limit or otherwise affect Purchaser's obligations under SECTION 5.04
with respect to Leased Employees.

            9.06. WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY. It is the intention of Parent, Sellers
and Purchaser to satisfy the provisions of ss. 4204 of ERISA with respect to any

<PAGE>

obligation that Sellers may have under any Multiemployer Pension Plan with
respect to Employees. Therefore, Parent, Sellers and Purchaser agree as follows:

                  (i)   Purchaser shall continue making contributions to each
      Multiemployer Plan in accordance with the terms of any applicable
      collective bargaining agreement obligating Parent or Sellers to make
      contributions to such Multiemployer Plan for substantially the same
      number of contribution base units for which Parent or Sellers or both
      had an obligation to contribute to the Multiemployer Plan as of the
      Closing Date; and

                  (ii)  unless exempt under Pension Benefit Guaranty
      Corporation Regulations ss.ss. 4204.11 or 4204.21, Purchaser shall post a
      bond or hold in escrow in favor of the Multiemployer Plan for a period
      of five plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning after
      the Closing Date in an amount and form that satisfies the requirements
      of ss. 4204(a)(1)(B) or ERISA; and

                  (iii) in the event that Purchaser withdraws in a complete
      or partial withdrawal under ss. 4201 of ERISA from a Multiemployer Plan
      during the first five years beginning after the Closing Date, and
      Purchaser fails to make any withdrawal liability payments when due,
      Sellers shall be secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability that
      Sellers would have had to the Multiemployer Plan but for the provisions
      of this SECTION 9.06 and ss. 4204 of ERISA subject, however, for any
      limitations on such liability under the Bankruptcy Code or any
      applicable bar Orders of the Bankruptcy Code.

      Nothing in this SECTION 9.06 shall constitute or be construed as a
post-Bankruptcy Court petition assumption or reaffirmation of any withdrawal
or other Liabilities.

            9.07. BONUS PROGRAM.

            (a) For the calendar year in which the Closing takes place,
Purchaser shall pay directly to the Employees hired by Purchaser the amounts
payable to them under the Bonus Program for the period between the Closing Date
and the end of such calendar year. Purchaser shall make such payments as and
when due under the Bonus Program.

            (b) For purposes of Purchaser's post-Closing obligations under this
SECTION 9.07, the Bonus Program shall be deemed applicable to the Business, and
shall take into account the results of operations of the Business, as owned by
Purchaser.

                                  ARTICLE X

                   SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES,
                           COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

            Notwithstanding any right of Purchaser (whether or not exercised) to
investigate the Business or any right of any party (whether or not exercised) to
investigate the accuracy of the representations and warranties of any other
party or parties contained in this Agreement, Sellers and Parent on one side and
Purchaser on the other side have the right to rely fully on the representations,

<PAGE>

warranties, covenants and agreements of each other contained in this Agreement.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Sellers, Parent and
Purchaser contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing until, and
terminate on, the First Holdback Expiration Date with respect to all matters
except representations and warranties contained in SECTIONS 2.07 OR 2.14 and
covenants and agreements contained in ARTICLE VIII, which will survive the
Closing until, and terminate on, the Final Holdback Expiration Date; provided
that any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that would otherwise
terminate in accordance with the above provisions of this ARTICLE X will
continue to survive if a Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice (as applicable) shall
have been timely given under ARTICLE XI on or prior to such termination date,
until the related claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise
resolved as provided in ARTICLE XI.

                                  ARTICLE XI

                               INDEMNIFICATION

            11.01. INDEMNIFICATION.

            (a) Subject to PARAGRAPH (C) of this Section and the other Sections
of this ARTICLE XI, Parent and Sellers shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties in respect of, and hold each of them harmless from and against, any and
all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by any of them or to which any of
them becomes subject, resulting from, arising out of, or relating to, (i) any
breach of representation or warranty or nonfulfillment of or failure to perform
any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Sellers contained in this
Agreement, (ii) any and all other Liabilities, obligations and costs of Sellers
arising prior to the Closing Date other than the Assumed Liabilities and (iii)
any and all other Liabilities, obligations and costs of Sellers arising prior to
the Closing Date (other than the Assumed Liabilities) but which are brought
against Purchaser prior to or after the Closing Date.

            (b) Subject to the other Sections of this ARTICLE XI, Purchaser
shall indemnify Sellers Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold each of them
harmless from and against, any and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by
any of them or to which any of them becomes subject, resulting from, arising out
of or relating to (i) any breach of representation or warranty or nonfulfillment
of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement or (ii) after the Closing, any Assumed Liability.

            (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no amounts of indemnity shall be payable as a result of any claim in
respect of a Loss arising under SECTION 11.01(A) unless and until (i) the
Closing has occurred and (ii) Purchaser Indemnified Parties have suffered,
incurred, sustained or become subject to Losses referred to in this SECTION
11.01 in excess of $200,000 in the aggregate (except as provided in the next
sentence), in which event Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall, to the extent
provided in SECTION 1.03(B) and the Escrow Agreement, be entitled to claim
indemnity (including all related fees and costs) solely from the balance of the
Purchaser's Holdback, if any, then remaining in the Escrow Account. The $200,000
threshold specified in the preceding sentence for entitlement to claim indemnity
shall not apply to a breach of a representation or warranty contained in
SECTIONS 2.02, 2.03, 2.07 OR 2.14, or to a breach of a covenant contained in

<PAGE>

SECTIONS 8.01, 8.02, 8.03, 15.04 OR 15.05; however, such indemnity claims shall
be limited to the remaining balance of the Purchaser's Holdback, as provided in
the preceding sentence.

            11.02. METHOD OF ASSERTING CLAIMS. All claims for indemnification by
any Indemnified Party under SECTION 11.01 shall be asserted and resolved only as
follows:

            (a) In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an
Indemnified Party might seek indemnity under SECTION 11.01 is asserted against
or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than a
Seller or any Affiliate of a Seller or of Purchaser (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), the
Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice with reasonable promptness to the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to provide the Claim Notice
with reasonable promptness after the Indemnified Party receives notice of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party's ability to defend has been irreparably prejudiced by such
failure of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will notify the
Indemnified Party as soon as practicable within the Dispute Period whether the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under SECTION
11.01 and whether the Indemnifying Party desires, at its sole cost and expense,
to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim.

                  (i)   If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified
      Party within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to
      defend the Indemnified Party with respect to the Third Party Claim
      pursuant to this SECTION 11.02(A), then the Indemnifying Party will
      have the right to defend, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
      Indemnified Party, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
      Party, such Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which
      proceedings will be vigorously and diligently prosecuted by the
      Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or will be settled at the
      discretion of the Indemnifying Party (but only with the consent of the
      Indemnified Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, in
      the case of any settlement that provides for any relief other than the
      payment of monetary damages as to which the Indemnified Party will be
      indemnified in full).  The Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have
      waived its right to dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party
      under SECTION 11.01 with respect to any Third Party Claim as to which
      it elects to control the defense.  The Indemnifying Party will have
      full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise
      or settlement thereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Indemnified Party
      may, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnified Party, at any time
      prior to the Indemnifying Party's delivery of the notice referred to in
      the first sentence of this SECTION 11.02(A)(I), file any motion, answer
      or other pleadings or take any other action that the Indemnified Party
      reasonably believes to be necessary or appropriate to protect its
      interests; and provided further, that if requested by the Indemnifying
      Party, the Indemnified Party will, at the sole cost and expense of the
      Indemnifying Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnifying
      Party in contesting any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party
      elects to contest.  The Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel
      to represent it in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any
      Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this

<PAGE>

      SECTION 11.02(A)(I), and the Indemnified Party will bear its own costs
      and expenses with respect to such separate counsel except as provided
      in the preceding sentence and except that the Indemnifying Party will
      pay the costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (x) in the
      Indemnified Party's good faith judgment, it is advisable, based on
      advice of counsel, for the Indemnified Party to be represented by
      separate counsel because a conflict or potential conflict exists
      between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party which makes
      representation of both parties inappropriate under applicable standards
      of professional conduct or (y) the named parties to such Third Party
      Claim include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and
      the Indemnified Party determines in good faith, based on advice of
      counsel, that defenses are available to it that are unavailable to the
      Indemnifying Party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified
      Party may retain or take over the control of the defense or settlement
      of any Third Party Claim the defense of which the Indemnifying Party
      has elected to control if the Indemnified Party irrevocably waives its
      right to indemnity under SECTION 11.01 with respect to such Third Party
      Claim.

                  (ii)  If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the
      Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party
      desires to defend the Third Party Claim pursuant to SECTION 11.02(A),
      or if the Indemnifying Party gives such notice but fails to prosecute
      vigorously and diligently or settle the Third Party Claim, then the
      Indemnified Party will have the right to defend, at the sole cost and
      expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Third Party Claim by all
      appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be prosecuted by the
      Indemnified Party in good faith or will be settled at the discretion of
      the Indemnified Party (with the consent of the Indemnifying Party,
      which consent will not be unreasonably withheld).  The Indemnified
      Party will have full control of such defense and proceedings, including
      any compromise or settlement thereof; provided, however, that if
      requested by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party will, at the
      sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, provide reasonable
      cooperation to the Indemnified Party and its counsel in contesting any
      Third Party Claim which the Indemnified Party is contesting.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this SECTION 11.02(A)(II),
      if the Indemnifying Party has notified the Indemnified Party within the
      Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability
      hereunder to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party
      Claim and if such dispute is resolved in favor of the Indemnifying
      Party in the manner provided in CLAUSE (III) below, the Indemnifying
      Party will not be required to bear the costs and expenses of the
      Indemnified Party's defense pursuant to this SECTION 11.02(A)(II) or of
      the Indemnifying Party's participation therein at the Indemnified
      Party's request, and the Indemnified Party will reimburse the
      Indemnifying Party in full for all reasonable costs and expenses
      incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with such litigation.
      The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense
      or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
      SECTION 11.02(A)(II), and the Indemnifying Party will bear its own
      costs and expenses with respect to such participation.

                  (iii) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified
      Party that it does not dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party
      with respect to the Third Party Claim under SECTION 11.01 or fails to
      notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period whether the
      Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party with

<PAGE>

      respect to such Third Party Claim, the Loss arising from such Third
      Party Claim will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying
      Party under SECTION 11.01 and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the
      amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party on demand following the
      final determination thereof.  If the Indemnifying Party has timely
      disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying
      Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to negotiate
      a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations
      within the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be resolved by
      arbitration in accordance with SECTION 11.02(C).

            (b) In the event any Indemnified Party has a claim under SECTION
11.01 against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice with reasonable
promptness to the Indemnifying Party. The failure by any Indemnified Party to
give the Indemnity Notice shall not impair such party's rights hereunder except
to the extent that an Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been
irreparably prejudiced thereby. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party that it does not dispute the claim described in such Indemnity
Notice or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period
whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described in such Indemnity
Notice, the Loss arising from the claim specified in such Indemnity Notice will
be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under SECTION 11.01
and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified
Party on demand following the final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying
Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations
within the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be resolved by the Bankruptcy
Court.

                                 ARTICLE XII

                                 TERMINATION

            12.01. TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated, and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned before the Closing:

Agreement and fails to cure such breach within 20 Business Days after receipt of
written notice thereof from Sellers and Parent and (ii) at the time of such
termination each Seller and Parent are neither materially in breach of, nor

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that with respect to any development, event, transaction or
circumstance of which Parent or Sellers have given to Purchaser a Development
Notification specified in SECTION 4.15, Purchaser's right to terminate this
Agreement and abandon the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed
exclusively by SECTION 12.01(C);

            (c) by Purchaser if (i) within 30 days immediately preceding such
termination, Parent or Sellers have given Purchaser a Development Notification
specified in SECTION 4.15, (ii) the development, event, transaction or
circumstance that is the subject of such Development Notification has had a
material adverse effect on the Condition of the Business, and (iii) at the time

any such condition is not caused by a breach, active participation or deliberate
nonfeasance by any Sellers or Parent, and (ii) at the time of such termination
each Seller and Parent are neither materially in breach of, nor materially in
default under this Agreement, in which case Sellers shall be entitled to the
Earnest Money Deposit and all interest earned thereon, and Purchaser shall not
be entitled to the Expense Reimbursement or the Breakup Fee;

            (e) by Sellers and Parent if (i) Purchaser withdraws, without
demonstrating an intention to amend and refile or resubmit promptly, any

any Governmental or Regulatory Authority that are necessary for the conditions
specified in SECTION 6.04 or SECTION 7.04 to be satisfied or (ii) any

            14.01 PROTECTIONS FOR PURCHASER.

            (a) Parent and Sellers acknowledge that Purchaser would not agree to
pursue the purchase of the Assets on the terms contemplated hereby without
certain protections and rights, as Parent and Sellers intend to commence the
Bankruptcy Proceedings promptly after the execution of this Agreement. Purchaser
has advised Sellers that it would not incur the expense or suffer the
uncertainty of attempting to purchase the Assets in the Bankruptcy Proceedings
except as hereinafter set forth. In accordance with the Restructuring Agreement
contemplated to be entered into with the Consenting Noteholders who, as of
November 22, 2000, were the holders of not less than 75% of the outstanding
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes, Sellers have determined that under the

REIMBURSEMENT"  means the amount to be paid to Purchaser in cash or  immediately
available funds (but not to exceed $800,000),  on account of amounts incurred by
Purchaser as actual  out-of-pocket  expenses in connection with the negotiation,

Expense  Reimbursement  is due to Purchaser as provided  hereunder,  it shall be
paid five  Business Days after the delivery by Purchaser to Sellers of a written
request for  payment of the Expense  Reimbursement,  accompanied  by  reasonably
detailed and accurate  supporting  documentation  for such  request.  If Sellers

Fee shall not be payable if the Bid  Protection  Order has not been issued,  nor

has been  issued  and is still in  effect,  nor  shall it be  payable  under any
circumstances  besides  those  specified in  PARAGRAPHS  (G), (I), (K) OR (M) of
SECTION 12.01 or PARAGRAPH (C) of this SECTION 14.01  (provided,  however,  that

      locations is consummated by another Person or Persons other than an

      Reorganization. Occurrence of  such an event shall entitle Purchaser to
      the Breakup Fee, Expense Reimbursement and Earnest Money Deposit, as
      provided herein, but shall not constitute a breach of, or a default
      under, this Agreement by Parent or Sellers.

                  (ii)  Purchaser shall not be entitled to the Breakup Fee,
      Expense Reimbursement or the Earnest Money Deposit if Purchaser is
      materially in breach of, or is materially in default under, this
      Agreement at the time of the occurrence of the event specified in
      CLAUSE (I) of this PARAGRAPH (C).

                  (iii) Purchaser shall not be entitled to the Breakup Fee if
      the Bid Protection Order has not been issued.  Purchaser shall not be
      entitled to the Expense Reimbursement unless the Cash Collateral Order
      has been issued or the Interim Cash Collateral Order has been issued
      and is still in effect (provided, however, that under the circumstances
      specified in PARAGRAPH (L) of SECTION 12.01, Purchaser's entitlement to
      the Noteholders' Undertaking Expense Reimbursement from Consenting
      Noteholders shall be determined under the Noteholders' Undertaking).

                  (iv)  Except as provided in CLAUSE (III) of this PARAGRAPH
      (C), Purchaser shall be entitled to the Breakup Fee, the Expense
      Reimbursement and a return of the Earnest Money Deposit (plus all
      interest thereon) if (A) Purchaser has terminated this Agreement
      pursuant to PARAGRAPHS (B), (C), (G) OR (M) of SECTION 12.01 and
      (B) within nine months after such termination, all or substantially all
      of the Assets at one or more of the three Business locations are
      acquired by another Person or Persons other than an Affiliate of
      Purchaser pursuant to a Subsequent 363 Motion or a Subsequent Plan of

      Reorganization at a price in excess of $149,000,000 (the "SUBSEQUENT
      PRICE").

      circumstances under which Purchaser is entitled to, or Sellers can be
      held liable for, the Breakup Fee.

      contained in this Agreement;

Deposit and all interest thereon shall be immediately released to Purchaser. The

            15.05. CONFIDENTIALITY. Except as otherwise required by the

will hold, and will use its best efforts to cause its Affiliates, and in the
case of Purchaser, any Person who has provided, or who is considering providing,
financing to Purchaser to finance all or any portion of the Purchase Price, and
their respective Representatives to hold, in strict confidence from any Person
(other than any such Affiliate, Person who has provided, or who is considering
providing, financing or Representative), unless (i) compelled to disclose by
judicial or administrative process (including, without limitation, in connection
with obtaining the necessary approvals of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby of Governmental or Regulatory Authorities) or by other
requirements of Law or (ii) disclosed in an Action or Proceeding brought by a
party hereto in pursuit of its rights or in the exercise of its remedies
hereunder, all documents and information concerning the other party or any of
its Affiliates furnished to it by the other party or such other party's
Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, except to the extent that such documents or information can
be shown to have been (A) previously known by the party receiving such documents
or information, (B) in the public domain (either prior to or after the
furnishing of such documents or information hereunder) through no fault of such
receiving party or (C) later acquired by the receiving party from another source
if the receiving party is not aware that such source is under an obligation to
another party hereto to keep such documents and information confidential;
provided that following the Closing the foregoing restrictions will not apply to
Purchaser's use of documents and information concerning the Business, the Assets
or the Assumed Liabilities furnished by Parent or Sellers hereunder. In the
event the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, upon the request
of the other parties, each party hereto will, and will cause its Affiliates, any
Person who has provided, or who is considering providing, financing to such
party and their respective Representatives to, promptly (and in no event later
than five Business Days after such request) redeliver or cause to be redelivered
all copies of documents and information furnished by the other party in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
destroy or cause to be destroyed all notes, memoranda, summaries, analyses,
compilations and other writings related thereto or based thereon prepared by the

            15.06. CERTAIN TUNICA BUSINESS PLANS.

            (a) The parties hereto acknowledge and accept that between the
execution of this Agreement and the Closing, Parent and FM have certain plans
regarding the Tunica Business and certain of the Assets located therein, as
described in PARAGRAPH (B) of this Section. Provided that such plans are carried
out in accordance with the provisions of this Section and FM's rights, interests
and obligations under the boat dock lease and sublease, as described in
PARAGRAPH (B) of this Section, become a part of the Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities and are transferred to Purchaser at the Closing in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, carrying out such plans and the transactions
incidental thereto shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or require a
modification of the Purchase Price.

<PAGE>

            (b) FM plans to convey to the County of Tunica, Mississippi (the
"COUNTY") approximately 50 acres of land (the "SUBJECT LAND") that is part of
the Real Property included in the Tunica Business, but is outside of the
Existing Levee (as defined in PARAGRAPH (C) of this Section). The County intends
to construct a boat dock and nature park on the Subject Land. The sole or
principal consideration that the County will pay to FM for the Subject Land will
be the granting to FM of a (i) lease to use the boat dock, with FM having no
obligation to make lease payments thereunder; and (ii) perpetual easement
allowing ingress and egress between the Tunica Business and the boat dock. FM
will negotiate with the County for a lease term of at least 15 years, but no
representations, warranties or covenants are made to Purchaser as to the actual
length of the lease term. FM, in turn, plans to sublease to one or more Persons
(which may include Affiliates of Parent or Sellers) the right to use the boat
dock for boat docking and riverboat cruises in return for sublease payments to
FM and other sublease terms and conditions that FM will negotiate in good faith
and on reasonable terms with the sublessees. If Parent and FM carry out the
plans described in this PARAGRAPH (B) prior to the Closing, the following
restrictions and obligations shall apply:

                  (i)   Without Purchaser's prior written consent, no Real
      Property located within the Existing Levee shall be conveyed, or
      committed to be conveyed, to the County nor shall FM grant, or commit
      to grant to the County, any rights to use such Real Property.

                  (ii)  FM shall give Purchaser (A) prompt written notice of
      the specific details of the plans, the Subject Land conveyance, and the
      boat dock lease and subleases as they become known to Purchaser and
      (B) a reasonable opportunity to consult and have discussions with FM
      regarding such matters other than the subleases.

            (c) "EXISTING LEVEE" means the area designated as "Existing Levee
[208]" on the map attached hereto as EXHIBIT J.

            15.07. COMPUTER SYSTEMS. Parent and FR covenant to Purchaser that
for a six-month period commencing on the Closing Date or for such shorter period
designated by Purchaser as provided below, FR shall, on a transitional basis,
lease to the Black Hawk Business FR's computer systems and provide to the Black
Hawk Business FR's MIS administrative support and maintenance to the same extent
and on the same terms as under the arrangement between FR and FBH that was in
effect in the ordinary and regular course of FR's and FBH's business prior to
the execution of this Agreement, as described in EXHIBIT K hereto, with the fees
and other costs specified therein prorated for the number of days during which
this post-Closing transitional arrangement remains in effect. Purchaser may
terminate this arrangement at any time prior to the expiration of this six-month
transitional period by (i) delivering to Parent or to FR written notice of
termination at least 30 days prior to the termination date, (ii) returning to FR
on or before the termination date all Books and Records (together with all
copies thereof in whatever form they exist) in Purchaser's or the Black Hawk
Business' possession or under its control that are owned or were provided by FR
pursuant to this arrangement, and (iii) paying to FR all fees and costs owed for
the period ending on the termination date, as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence.

<PAGE>

            15.08. AUTHORIZED PRE-CLOSING ACTIONS AND ACTIVITIES.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and Sellers
(and their respective Affiliates) are authorized under this Agreement to take
the following actions and conduct the following activities at any time or from
time to time prior to the Closing:

            (a) commencing, continuing and concluding the Bankruptcy
Proceedings, including the filing with the Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court of
applications, motions and plans seeking or providing relief not inconsistent
with the Bankruptcy Code, the transactions at the Closing contemplated by this
Agreement or the proceedings contemplated by SECTION 14.02;

            (b) taking all actions necessary or appropriate to comply with the
Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, local rules of
practice promulgated by the Bankruptcy Court and Orders of the Bankruptcy Court
so long as such actions are not inconsistent with the transactions at the
Closing contemplated by this Agreement or with the proceedings contemplated by
SECTION 14.02;

            (c) liquidating in an orderly manner Parent's, Sellers' and their
respective Affiliates' assets, stock and other equity interests; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Assets shall be dealt with in accordance with, and as
contemplated by, this Agreement;

            (d) entering into Contracts with existing creditors, lessors,
licensors and licensees regarding the restructuring of their claims against
Parent, Sellers or their respective Affiliates in a manner not inconsistent with
the transactions at the Closing contemplated by this Agreement;

            (e) adopting a retention and severance program for members of
management of Parent, Sellers or their respective Affiliates; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that such program and the obligations thereunder shall be Retained Liabilities;

            (f) paying success fees to the Subject Parties for the sale or other
disposition of stock or other equity interests in Parent, Sellers or any of
their respective Affiliates; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the obligations to make
such payments shall be Retained Liabilities;

            (g) not making regular payments that are due to the Indenture
Trustee for the benefit of holders of the Senior Secured Notes;

            (h) making payments to the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of
holders of the Senior Secured Notes; and

            (i) retaining and paying professionals in connection with the
matters described in PARAGRAPHS (A) THROUGH (E) of this SECTION.

            The taking of any such actions or the conduct of any such activities
by Parent or Sellers (or their respective Affiliates) shall not constitute a
breach of this Agreement or require a modification of the Purchase Price.

<PAGE>

            15.09. WAIVER; REMEDIES. Any term or condition of this Agreement may
be waived at any time by the party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but
no such waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly
executed by or on behalf of the party waiving such term or condition. No waiver
by any party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any
other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion. All remedies,
either under this Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded, will be cumulative
and not alternative.

            15.10. AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or
modified only by a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of each
party hereto.

            15.11. NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each party hereto and their
respective successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the
parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other Person other
than any Person entitled to indemnity under ARTICLE XI.

            15.12. NO ASSIGNMENT; BINDING EFFECT. Neither this Agreement nor any
right, interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned by Purchaser without the
prior written consent of Sellers and Parent and any attempt to do so will be
void, except (i) for assignments and transfers by operation of Law and (ii) that
Purchaser may assign any or all of its rights, interests and obligations
hereunder (including, without limitation, its rights under ARTICLE XI) to (A)
any financial institution providing purchase money or other financing to
Purchaser from time to time as collateral security for such financing and (B) a
wholly-owned subsidiary in each of Nevada, Colorado and Mississippi. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of
and is enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

            15.13. DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. This Agreement shall confer no
obligation on the part of any directors or officers of Parent, Sellers or any of
their Affiliates to remain employed by, or to remain on the board of directors
or as managers of, any such entities after the date of this Agreement.

            15.14. HEADINGS. The headings used in this Agreement have been
inserted for convenience of reference only and do not define or limit the
provisions hereof.

            15.15. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; VENUE. Each party hereto irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court in any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
Operative Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
and agrees that any such action, suit or proceeding shall be brought only in
such court. Each party irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue
of any such action, suit or proceeding brought in such a court and any claim
that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in such a court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

<PAGE>

            15.16. INVALID PROVISIONS. If any provision of this Agreement is
held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law,
and if the rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Agreement will
not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (i) such provision will be
fully severable, (ii) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof
and (iii) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force
and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision or by its severance herefrom.

            15.17. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the (i) Laws of the State of Nevada applicable to a
contract executed and performed exclusively in such State, without giving effect
to the conflicts of laws principles thereof, and (ii) the Bankruptcy Code, to
the extent applicable.

            15.18. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument.

            15.19. EMPLOYEES. Until the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement, other than termination because of a material breach by Purchaser,
Purchaser shall not, and Purchaser shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly
or indirectly, hire or seek to hire any Employees or any officers or employees
of Parent, any Seller or any Affiliate of Parent or of any Seller (collectively,
the "SUBJECT EMPLOYERS") or encourage any of the foregoing Persons to terminate
their employment with any of the Subject Employers unless the Subject Employers
have first terminated such Persons' employment.

            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the duly authorized officer of each party as of the date first
above written.

                              FIRST AMENDMENT TO

                         PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT

      This FIRST  AMENDMENT TO PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT  (this  "Amendment"),
dated as of December 4, 2000,  is entered into by and among  MAJESTIC  INVESTOR,
LLC, a Delaware limited-liability company ("Purchaser");  FITZGERALDS LAS VEGAS,
INC., a Nevada corporation ("FLV"); 101 MAIN STREET LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, a
Colorado  limited-liability  company ("FBH");  FITZGERALDS MISSISSIPPI,  INC., a
Mississippi  corporation ("FM" and collectively with FLV and FBH,  "Sellers" and
each, a "Seller");  and FITZGERALDS  GAMING  CORPORATION,  a Nevada  corporation
("Parent").  Capitalized  terms not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to
them in the  Purchase  and Sale  Agreement,  dated as of November  22, 2000 (the
"Agreement"),  by and among the parties to this Amendment and certain Affiliates
of Parent or Sellers named on the signature pages of the Agreement.

      In  consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth in this
Amendment,  and for other  good and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  and
sufficiency  of which are  hereby  acknowledged,  the  parties  hereto  agree as
follows:

      1. INCONSISTENCIES. If any inconsistencies exist between the provisions of
this Amendment and the provisions of the Agreement,  then the provisions of this
Amendment  shall  control  and  supersede  the  inconsistent  provisions  of the
Agreement. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all references to Paragraphs
and  Subparagraphs are to Paragraphs and Subparagraphs of the Agreement and such
Paragraphs  and  Subparagraphs  referred  to shall  include  the  effect  of the
amendments hereunder.

      2. AMENDMENTS. The Agreement is hereby amended as follows:

            A.  PARAGRAPH  (B) of SECTION  1.03 is amended  and  restated in its
entirety as follows:

                     (b) (i) There  shall be  withheld  from the Cash  Component
                  payable to Sellers at the Closing  Three  Million Five Hundred
                  Thousand Dollars  ($3,500,000) (the  "Purchaser's  Holdback"),
                  which amount  shall be deposited by Purchaser  and held in the
                  Escrow  Account.  From time to time prior to the date which is
                  nine  months  from  the  Closing  Date  (the  "First  Holdback
                  Expiration Date"), in accordance with the Escrow Agreement (A)
                  Purchaser  may apply the  Purchaser's  Holdback  to pay, or to
                  provide for the payment of, any liability of Parent or Sellers
                  to Purchaser  resulting from (I)  post-Closing  adjustments of
                  the Cash  Component  other than the Hotel  Adjustment  Amount,
                  (II) Parent's and Sellers'  indemnification  obligations under
                  SECTION 11.01 or (III) Underestimated  Re-Flagging Costs under
                  SECTION  1.16  and  (B)  Sellers  may  apply  the  Purchaser's
                  Holdback  to pay,  or to  provide  for  the  payment  of,  any
                  liability   of   Purchaser   to  Sellers   for   Overestimated
                  Re-Flagging  Costs as  provided in SECTION  1.16.  Between the
                  12-month and 14-month  anniversaries  of the Closing  Date, in

<PAGE>

                  accordance with the Escrow Agreement,  Purchaser may apply the
                  Purchaser's Holdback to pay, or to provide for the payment of,
                  any liability of Sellers to Purchaser for the Hotel Adjustment
                  Amount under SECTION 1.15. From time to time between the First
                  Holdback  Expiration Date and the date which is 12 months from

                  Expiration  Date"),  in accordance with the Escrow  Agreement,
                  Purchaser may apply up to One Million Dollars  ($1,000,000) of
                  the remaining  balance of the Purchaser's  Holdback to pay, or
                  to provide  for the  payment  of, any  liability  of Parent or
                  Sellers to  Purchaser  resulting  from  Parent's  and Seller's
                  indemnification  obligations  under SECTION 11.01 only as they
                  pertain  to  breaches  of   representations   and   warranties
                  contained  in SECTIONS  2.07 OR 2.14 or breaches of  covenants
                  contained in SECTIONS 8.01, 8.02 OR 8.03.

                          (ii) On the 14-month  anniversary of the Closing Date,
                  any  portion  of the  Purchaser's  Holdback  in  excess of One
                  Million Dollars  ($1,000,000)  remaining in the Escrow Account
                  shall be  released  to Sellers in  accordance  with the Escrow
                  Agreement or, in the event of a pending  dispute,  as provided
                  in the Escrow  Agreement (the "First  Release").  On the Final
                  Holdback  Expiration  Date,  any  portion  of the  Purchaser's
                  Holdback  remaining in the Escrow Account shall be released to
                  Sellers in  accordance  with the Escrow  Agreement  or, in the
                  event  of  a  pending  dispute,  as  provided  in  the  Escrow
                  Agreement.

                          (iii) There  shall be added to each and every  payment
                  to  Purchaser  or  Sellers  out  of the  Purchaser's  Holdback
                  pursuant to this SECTION 1.03(B) a proportionate  share of the
                  interest earned on the Purchaser's  Holdback  through the date
                  of such payment.

            B.  CLAUSE (I) of SECTION  1.04(A) is amended  and  restated  in its
entirety as follows:

                           (i)  One   Hundred   Forty   Nine   Million   Dollars
                  ($149,000,000),  subject to adjustment as provided in SECTIONS
                  1.05, 1.06, 1.07, 1.15 AND 1.16 (the "Cash Component"); plus

            C. The  following  sentence  is inserted at the end of CLAUSE (I) of
SECTION  1.06(C):  "Final  EBIDTA shall be subject to  adjustment as provided in
PARAGRAPH (D) of this SECTION 1.06."

            D. The following new PARAGRAPH (D) is inserted  after  PARAGRAPH (C)
of SECTION 1.06:

                     (d) (i) The  provisions  of this  PARAGRAPH (D) shall apply
                  only if the  Closing  Date is prior to July 31, 2001 and as of

<PAGE>

                           (ii) Final EBITDA shall be reduced by an amount equal
                  to (I)  the  amounts  that  were  payable  by  Sellers  to the
                  companies  listed in  SECTION  1.06(D)(II)  OF THE  DISCLOSURE
                  SCHEDULE (the "Hotel  Companies")  under the original terms of
                  the Contracts listed in SECTION  1.06(D)(II) OF THE DISCLOSURE
                  SCHEDULE  (the  "Hotel  Contracts")  for the  12-month  period
                  covered by the Final EBITDA  Financial  Statements (the "Final
                  EBITDA  Period")  minus  (II)  the  amounts  actually  paid by
                  Sellers to the Hotel  Companies  under the Hotel Contracts for
                  the Final EBITDA Period.

            E. SECTION 1.07 is amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

                     1.07. Post-Closing Audit and Adjustment.

                     (a) Parent will have the right to review or audit the Final
                  Balance  Sheet,  the  calculation  of Final EBITDA,  the Hotel
                  Calculations  under  SECTION  1.15 and the Actual  Re-Flagging
                  Costs under  SECTION  1.16.  Any  appropriate  corrections  or
                  restatements  resulting  from such review or audit that affect
                  the Cash  Component  adjustments  specified in SECTIONS  1.05,
                  1.06, 1.15 OR 1.16 will require a  corresponding  cash payment
                  by Purchaser to Sellers in the case of an increase in the Cash
                  Component,  or  reimbursement  by or on behalf of  Sellers  to
                  Purchaser in the case of a reduction of the Cash Component. If
                  Parent disagrees with the Final Balance Sheet, the calculation
                  of Final EBITDA,  any of the Hotel  Calculations or the Actual
                  Re-Flagging  Costs,  Parent  shall  notify  Purchaser  of such
                  disagreement in writing,  specifying in detail the particulars
                  of such  disagreement,  within 15 Business Days after Parent's
                  receipt of the Final Balance Sheet,  the  calculation of Final
                  EBITDA or the Hotel  Calculations in question or documentation
                  supporting the Actual  Re-Flagging  Costs,  as the case may be
                  (each such notification,  a "Dispute  Notice").  To the extent
                  that any portion of the Final Balance Sheet or  calculation of
                  Final EBITDA is not in dispute,  within 15 Business Days after
                  Parent's   receipt  of  the  Final   Balance   Sheet  and  the
                  calculation of Final EBITDA,  Sellers shall pay or cause to be
                  paid to Purchaser  or Purchaser  shall pay or cause to be paid
                  to Sellers, as the case may be, that portion of the adjustment
                  to the  Cash  Component  which  is not in  dispute.  Any  such
                  payment  owed by  Sellers  shall be made from the  Purchaser's
                  Holdback as provided  in SECTION  1.03(B),  to the extent that
                  the  Purchaser's  Holdback is sufficient for that purpose.  To
                  the extent  that any  portion of the Hotel  Adjustment  Amount
                  under  SECTION  1.15 is not in  dispute,  such  portion not in
                  dispute  shall  be paid to  Purchaser  out of the  Purchaser's
                  Holdback,  as provided in SECTION  1.03(B),  after 15 Business
                  Days have  elapsed  from the date of  Parent's  receipt of the
                  calculation  of  Post-Closing  Hotel  Revenues.  To the extent
                  there are any  Underestimated Re-Flagging  Costs which are not

<PAGE>

                  in dispute,  they shall be  reimbursed to Purchaser out of the
                  Purchaser's Holdback, as provided in SECTION 1.03(B), after 15
                  Business  Days have elapsed from the date of Parent's  receipt
                  of supporting  documentation for the Actual Re-Flagging Costs.
                  To the extent there are any  Overestimated  Re-Flagging  Costs
                  that  Purchaser  has not paid to  Sellers  within  the  10-day
                  period  specified  in SECTION  1.16,  at Sellers'  option they
                  shall be paid by Purchaser  to Sellers out of the  Purchaser's
                  Holdback,  as provided in SECTIONS 1.03(B) AND 1.16; PROVIDED,
                  HOWEVER,  that  if  Sellers  do  not  obtain  payment  of  the
                  Overestimated   Re-Flagging   Costs  out  of  the  Purchaser's
                  Holdback,  Purchaser  shall remain  liable to Sellers for such
                  payment.

                     (b) Purchaser and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
                  efforts for a period of 30 days after  Parent's  delivery of a
                  Dispute Notice (or such longer period as Purchaser and Sellers
                  mutually  agree upon) to resolve any  disagreements  raised by
                  Parent  with  respect  to  the  Final   Balance   Sheet,   the
                  calculation  of Final EBITDA,  the Hotel  Calculations  or the
                  Actual  Re-Flagging  Costs, as the case may be. If, at the end
                  of such  period,  Purchaser  and Sellers are unable to resolve
                  such  disagreements,  Deloitte & Touche  and Price  Waterhouse
                  Coopers,   independent  auditors  of  Sellers  and  Purchaser,
                  respectively, shall jointly select a third independent auditor
                  from a recognized national standing "Big-5" accounting firm to
                  resolve any remaining disagreements. Fees and expenses of such
                  third independent  auditor shall be borne equally by Purchaser
                  on one side and Sellers on the other side.  The  determination
                  by such third independent auditor shall be final,  binding and
                  conclusive  on  Purchaser,  Parent and Sellers.  Purchaser and
                  Sellers  shall use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to cause
                  such  third  independent  auditor  to make  its  determination
                  within 30 days of accepting  its  selection.  If Parent or any
                  Sellers  determine  that a delay  in this  dispute  resolution
                  mechanism threatens to delay the closing of their cases in the
                  Bankruptcy  Proceedings,  then  Parent or any Sellers may seek
                  means from the  Bankruptcy  Court to enforce such  independent
                  auditor's  determination.  The parties  hereto,  Sellers'  and
                  Purchaser's  respective  independent auditors,  and such third
                  selected  independent auditor shall agree to be subject to the
                  jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court for this purpose.  Within
                  ten  days  after  the  date of  determination  by  such  third
                  independent  auditor,  Purchaser shall pay Sellers, or Sellers
                  shall  pay or cause to be paid to  Purchaser,  as the case may
                  be, the amount of the  adjustment to the Cash Component or the
                  amount   of   the    Overestimated    Re-Flagging   Costs   or
                  Underestimated  Re-Flagging Costs, as the case may be, that is
                  determined  to be due and payable.  Any such  payments owed by
                  Sellers  shall  be  made  from  the  Purchaser's  Holdback  as
                  provided   in  SECTION   1.03(B),   to  the  extent  that  the
                  Purchaser's Holdback is sufficient for that purpose. Any such

<PAGE>

                  payment of Overestimated  Re-Flagging  Costs owed by Purchaser
                  shall be made as  provided  in  SECTIONS  1.03(B) AND 1.16 and
                  PARAGRAPH (A) of this SECTION 1.07.

            F. In the  first  sentence  of  SECTION  1.08(B),  the  phrase  "AND
1.06(B)," is changed to ",1.06(B)  AND  1.16(B),"  and in the third  sentence of
SECTION  1.08(C),  the term  "First  Holdback  Expiration  Date" is  changed  to
"14-month anniversary of the Closing Date."

            G. The  following  new  SECTIONS  1.15 AND 1.16 are  inserted  after
SECTION 1.14:

                     1.15 Hotel Cash Component Adjustments:

                     (a) A  post-Closing  reduction  of the Cash  Component  and
                  delivery by Purchaser to Parent of the Hotel Calculations,  as
                  provided in this SECTION 1.15, shall be made only if the Hotel
                  Consents have not been obtained as of the Closing.

                     (b) The Cash  Component  shall be reduced by an amount (the
                  "Hotel Adjustment Amount") equal to the product of (i) the Las
                  Vegas  Business'  hotel  room  revenues  for the Final  EBITDA
                  Period (the "Pre-Closing  Hotel Revenues") minus the Las Vegas
                  Business'   hotel  room  revenues  for  the  12-month   period
                  commencing  on  the  Closing  Date  (the  "Post-Closing  Hotel
                  Revenues")  minus Sellers'  payments under the Hotel Contracts
                  for the Final EBITDA Period (the "Hotel Contracts  Payments"),
                  multiplied by (ii) four. The Hotel Adjustment  Amount shall be
                  paid to Purchaser solely out of the Purchaser's  Holdback,  as
                  provided  in SECTION  1.03(B).  No Cash  Component  adjustment
                  shall be made under this SECTION  1.15 if the amount  computed
                  under CLAUSE (I) of this PARAGRAPH (B) is a negative number or
                  if the Hotel Consents have been obtained as of the Closing.

                     (c) Purchaser shall deliver to Parent written  calculations
                  of the Pre-Closing  Hotel  Revenues,  the  Post-Closing  Hotel
                  Revenues and the Hotel Contracts Payments  (collectively,  the
                  "Hotel  Calculations")  in  sufficient  detail  to  facilitate
                  Parent's  review  or audit of such  calculations  pursuant  to
                  SECTION 1.07.  Purchaser shall deliver the  Pre-Closing  Hotel
                  Revenues calculation to Parent together with the Final Balance
                  Sheet and the Final  EBITDA  Financial  Statements.  Purchaser
                  shall deliver the Post-Closing  Hotel Revenues  calculation to
                  Parent  within 15 Business  Days after the end of the 12-month
                  period  that   commenced  on  the  Closing  Date.   The  Hotel
                  Calculations  shall  be made in a manner  consistent  with the
                  calculation  of  revenues  in  the  Interim  EBITDA  Financial
                  Statements and the Final EBITDA Financial Statements.

                     1.16 HOTEL RE-FLAGGING AFTER THE CLOSING.

                     (a) The  provisions  of this  SECTION 1.16 shall only apply
                  if,  as of the  Closing,  the  Hotel  Consents  have  not been
                  obtained and the Re-Flagging Changes have not been implemented
                  pursuant to SECTION 15.20.

                     (b) Sellers  shall  present to Purchaser at or prior to the
                  Closing  a  reasonably   detailed   written  estimate  of  the
                  anticipated costs to be incurred by Purchaser to implement the
                  Re-Flagging   Changes   after  the  Closing  (the   "Estimated
                  Re-Flagging  Costs"). At the Closing,  the Cash Component will
                  be decreased by the Estimated Re-Flagging Costs.

                     (c) As promptly as reasonably  practicable  after Purchaser
                  has  implemented  the  Re-Flagging  Changes,  Purchaser  shall
                  deliver  to  Parent  supporting  documentation  for the  costs
                  actually  incurred by Purchaser to implement  the  Re-Flagging
                  Changes (the "Actual  Re-Flagging Costs") in reasonable detail
                  to  facilitate  a  review  or audit by  Parent  of the  Actual
                  Re-Flagging  Costs  pursuant to SECTION 1.07.  The amount,  if
                  any,  by  which  the  Actual   Re-Flagging  Costs  exceed  the
                  Estimated  Re-Flagging Costs (the "Underestimated  Re-Flagging
                  Costs")  shall  be paid to  Purchaser  out of the  Purchaser's
                  Holdback,  as provided in SECTION 1.03(B). The amount, if any,
                  by which the  Estimated  Re-Flagging  Costs  exceed the Actual
                  Re-Flagging  Costs  (the  "Overestimated  Re-Flagging  Costs")
                  shall be paid by  Purchaser  to Sellers  within ten days after
                  Purchaser  delivers  to Sellers the  supporting  documentation
                  specified in this  PARAGRAPH  (B). If Purchaser  does not make
                  such payment  within this ten-day  period,  Sellers shall have
                  the  right  to  obtain  such  payment  of  the   Overestimated
                  Re-Flagging Costs out of the Purchaser's  Holdback. If Sellers
                  do not obtain  such  payment  from the  Purchaser's  Holdback,
                  Purchaser  shall  remain  liable to Sellers for payment of the
                  Overestimated Re-Flagging Costs.

                     (d) Purchaser  shall  complete the removal of the Las Vegas
                  Business' existing hotel signs, logos,  uniforms and amenities
                  that are necessary to implement the Re-Flagging Changes within
                  60 days after the Closing Date.  Purchaser shall submit to the
                  appropriate  vendors or suppliers all purchase  orders for new
                  hotel signs, logos,  uniforms and amenities that are necessary
                  to complete the  Re-Flagging  Changes within 90 days after the
                  Closing and shall  deliver to Parent  copies of such  purchase
                  orders within ten days after they have been  submitted to such
                  vendors or suppliers. The Re-Flagging Changes shall be made in
                  a  commercially  reasonable  manner,  consistent  with the Las
                  Vegas   Business'   normal   and   customary   practices   and
                  expenditures prior to the Closing.

            H. In the second  sentence of SECTION  2.05,  "OR SECTION  15.20" is
inserted immediately after "SECTION 15.08."

            I. At the end of the first  sentence of SECTION  4.04 and at the end
of CLAUSE (II) of SECTION 4.06, "OR SECTION 15.20" is inserted immediately after
"SECTION 15.08."

            J.  SECTION  4.09(A) is amended  and  restated  in its  entirety  as
follows:

                     (a) (i) EXHIBIT F contains  preliminary  title  reports for
                  the Real  Property  and the Real  Property  Leases (the "Title
                  Reports").

                         (ii)  Purchaser  shall  have  30 days  (the  "Exception
                  Review Period") from the date Purchaser receives a copy of the
                  ALTA  surveys  for the Real  Property  and the  Real  Property
                  Leases and all documents of record listed as title  exceptions
                  in the Title Reports (the "Title  Exceptions") within which to
                  review  and  approve  the Title  Exceptions.  Purchaser  shall
                  notify Sellers in writing  within the Exception  Review Period
                  if Purchaser  disapproves of any of the Title  Exceptions (the
                  "Title Exception  Objections").  If Purchaser fails to deliver
                  the Title  Exception  Objections  within the Exception  Review
                  Period,   the  Title  Exceptions  shall  be  deemed  Permitted
                  Exceptions.   If  Purchaser   delivers  the  Title   Exception
                  Objections  to Sellers  within the  Exception  Review  Period,
                  Sellers  shall have 15 days (the  "Objection  Review  Period")
                  from the date of the receipt of the Title Exception Objections
                  to  notify  Purchaser  in  writing  of  Sellers'  approval  or
                  disapproval of the Title Exception Objections. If Sellers fail
                  to notify  Purchaser of their approval or  disapproval  within
                  the Objection  Review Period,  Sellers shall be deemed to have
                  disapproved all of the Title Exception Objections.  If Sellers
                  do not accept all of the Title Exception Objections, Purchaser
                  shall have five days (the "Termination  Notification  Period")
                  from the earlier of (x) the expiration of the Objection Review
                  Period or (y) the date that  Purchaser  receives  notice  from
                  Sellers  of  their  disapproval  of some  or all of the  Title
                  Exception  Objections,  to terminate  the  Purchase  Agreement
                  pursuant to SECTION 12.01(P).  If Purchaser does not terminate
                  the Purchase Agreement pursuant to SECTION 12.01(P) within the
                  Termination  Notification Period, Purchaser shall be deemed to
                  have withdrawn the Title Exception  Objections not approved by
                  Sellers.

                         (iii)  Following  expiration  of the  Exception  Review
                  Period,  Permitted  Exceptions  shall also include those other
                  title exceptions which (A) are disclosed or become apparent to
                  Purchaser after the date hereof, (B) are not already Permitted
                  Exceptions,  (C) cannot be removed by the  payment of a sum of
                  money,  (D) are not caused by the  intentional act of a Seller
                  or any Affiliate of a Seller after the date hereof,  and which
                  do not  materially  adversely  affect  the  value  of the Real

<PAGE>

                  Property  or  Improvements,  or the  continued  use thereof as
                  currently  conducted,  or as to which Purchaser has not timely
                  objected.

            K. The following new SECTIONS 4.19, 4.20 AND 4.21 are inserted after
SECTION 4.18:

                  CONSENTS.  If prior to the Closing it becomes readily apparent
                  to  Sellers  that  any of the  consents  (or in  lieu  thereof
                  waivers or appropriate  Orders of the Bankruptcy Court) listed
                  in SECTION  6.05 of the  DISCLOSURE  SCHEDULE  that pertain to
                  Sellers' Contracts with GE Capital Modular Space (the "Modular
                  Space  Consents")  will, as of the Closing,  (i) not have been
                  obtained, (ii) be subject to the satisfaction of any condition
                  that has not been  satisfied or waived or (iii) not be in full
                  force and effect, Sellers shall so notify Purchaser in writing
                  and shall  negotiate  with Purchaser in a spirit of good faith
                  and cooperation  with a view towards  reaching an amicable and
                  fair  agreement  on a  financial  remedy or  accommodation  to
                  Purchaser or a substitute  for the Modular Space Consents that
                  is reasonably  satisfactory  to Purchaser.  Any such agreement
                  between  Sellers  and  Purchaser  with  respect to the Modular
                  Space Consents shall constitute satisfaction of the conditions
                  specified in SECTION 6.05 as they pertain to the Modular Space
                  Consents.

                     4.20. BLACK HAWK BUSINESS CONDITION OF IMPROVEMENTS.  Prior
                  to the Closing,  Sellers shall remedy in all material respects
                  the conditions  described in SECTION 2.08(I) OF THE DISCLOSURE
                  SCHEDULE  (including the descriptions in  correspondence  from
                  consultant Harry L. Siebert  contained  therein),  in a manner
                  reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser.

                     4.21.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CONVEYANCE  Documents.  Parent
                  and Sellers shall execute any  documents  necessary,  make any
                  filings necessary,  and otherwise cooperate in good faith with
                  Purchaser,  to  establish  an  effective  chain of title  with
                  respect to the trademark  Intellectual Property to be conveyed
                  to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.

            L. The following new SECTION 5.08 is inserted after SECTION 5.07:

                     5.08  PURCHASER'S  OBLIGATIONS  REGARDING THE MODULAR SPACE
                  CONSENTS.  If prior to the Closing Purchaser  receives written
                  notification  from Sellers that it has become readily apparent
                  that the Modular Space Consents  will, as of the Closing,  (i)
                  not have been obtained, (ii) be subject to the satisfaction of
                  any condition  that has not been  satisfied or waived or (iii)
                  not be in full force and  effect,  Purchaser  shall  negotiate
                  with Sellers in a spirit of good faith and cooperation  with a
                  view  towards  reaching an amicable  and fair  agreement  on a

<PAGE>

                  financial remedy or accommodation to Purchaser or a reasonably
                  satisfactory substitute for the Modular Space Consents that is
                  reasonably  satisfactory  to  Purchaser.  Any  such  agreement
                  between  Purchaser  and  Sellers  with  respect to the Modular
                  Space Consents shall constitute satisfaction of the conditions
                  specified in SECTION 6.05 as they pertain to the Modular Space
                  Consents.

            M. The following is inserted at the end of SECTION 6.05:

                  If it becomes readily  apparent to Sellers that any conditions
                  specified in SUB-CLAUSES (A), (B) AND (C) of this Section will
                  not be satisfied (and waivers or Bankruptcy  Court Orders will
                  not  be  obtained)  as of  the  Closing  with  respect  to any
                  consents that (i) are listed in SECTION 6.05 OF THE DISCLOSURE
                  SCHEDULE and pertain to Sellers'  Contracts with International
                  Game Technology  ("IGT") or (ii) pertain to FM's Contract with
                  Hotel  Information  Systems  ("HIS"),  Sellers  shall have the
                  right to provide  Purchaser with  reasonably  comparable  slot
                  machine player tracking  systems in substitution  for any such
                  IGT  Contracts or a reasonably  comparable  hotel  information
                  system for the Tunica  Business  in  substitution  for the HIS
                  Contract, as the case may be; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such
                  substituted system shall be subject to Purchaser's  reasonable
                  approval.  The  substitution  of any player  tracking or hotel
                  information  system  pursuant to the preceding  sentence shall
                  constitute  satisfaction  of the conditions  specified in this
                  Section  as  they  pertain  to  the  corresponding  IGT or HIS
                  Contract.

            N. The following new SECTION 6.12 is inserted after SECTION 6.11:

                     6.12.  CERTAIN  DOMAIN  NAME  REGISTRATIONS.  Prior  to the
                  Closing, Sellers shall make commercially reasonable efforts to
                  (i) cause the  respective  registrants  to transfer the domain
                  name registrations listed in SECTION 2.10(A) OF THE DISCLOSURE
                  SCHEDULE  ("Domain  Name  Registrations")  to Sellers and (ii)
                  avoid the loss of any Intellectual Property rights, including,
                  but not  limited  to,  those  registrations  listed in SECTION
                  1.01(A)(V)  OF  THE  DISCLOSURE   SCHEDULE  arising  from  the
                  registration  and use of the Domain Name  Registrations.  Such
                  efforts  shall include any one or more of the  following:  (A)
                  purchasing the Domain Name  Registrations,  (B) arbitration or
                  (C)   litigation   against  any  owners  of  the  Domain  Name
                  Registrations   who  refuse  to   transfer   the  Domain  Name
                  Registrations  and  attempt to benefit  commercially  from the
                  Domain Name Registrations. Sellers shall consult in good faith
                  with  Purchaser  with respect to their  efforts to satisfy the
                  conditions  specified in this Section. Any and all Domain Name
                  Registrations  acquired  by Parent or any  Sellers at any time

<PAGE>

                  shall be transferred  and assigned to Purchaser  together with
                  the other  Intellectual  Property listed in SECTION 1.01(A)(V)
                  OF THE DISCLOSURE  SCHEDULE at the Closing pursuant to SECTION
                  1.01(A)(V)  or  by  separate  agreement  if  the  Domain  Name
                  Registrations  are  acquired  by Parent or  Sellers  after the
                  Closing.

            O. The  second  sentence  of ARTICLE X is amended  and  restated  as
follows:

                     The representations,  warranties,  covenants and agreements
                  of Sellers,  Parent and Purchaser  contained in this Agreement

                  Holdback  Expiration  Date with respect to all matters  except
                  (i) the covenants and  agreements  herein  regarding the Hotel
                  Adjustment  Amount,  which will survive the Closing until, and
                  terminate   on,  the  date  of  the  First  Release  and  (ii)
                  representations  and warranties  contained in SECTIONS 2.07 OR
                  2.14 and covenants and  agreements  contained in ARTICLE VIII,
                  which will survive the Closing  until,  and  terminate on, the
                  Final   Holdback    Expiration   Date;   provided   that   any
                  representation,  warranty,  covenant or  agreement  that would
                  otherwise terminate in accordance with the above provisions of
                  this  ARTICLE X will  continue to survive if a Claim Notice or
                  Indemnity Notice (as applicable)  shall have been timely given
                  under ARTICLE XI on or prior to such  termination  date, until
                  the related claim for  indemnification  has been  satisfied or
                  otherwise resolved as provided in ARTICLE XI.

            P.  SECTION  12.01(P)  is amended and  restated  in its  entirety as

<PAGE>

                  to being provided in the Cash  Collateral  Stipulation),  then
                  the Cash  Collateral  Order shall also include the Final Order
                  granting such motion.

                     "Cash Collateral Stipulation" means the Agreement Regarding

                  authorizing, among other things, the use by Parent and Sellers
                  of Cash  Collateral  and further (x)  consenting to the use of

                  super-priority   administrative   claim  status  for  (i)  the
                  Fitzgeralds   Undertaking  Expense  Reimbursement,   (ii)  the

                  of the Lien in favor of the Indenture  Trustee for the benefit
                  of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes; PROVIDED, however,
                  that   at  the   option   of   Sellers,   the   super-priority
                  administrative   claim   status   for  (i)   the   Fitzgeralds
                  Undertaking   Expense   Reimbursement,    (ii)   the   Expense
                  Reimbursement,  and (iii) the  Break-up  Fee in respect of the

                  holders  of the  Senior  Secured  Notes may be  obtained  by a
                  separate  motion brought under  ss.364(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy
                  Code  (as  opposed  to  being  granted  by  means  of the Cash
                  Collateral Stipulation).

                     "Interim  Cash  Collateral   Order"  means  an  interim  or
                  preliminary  Order of the Bankruptcy  Court approving the Cash
                  Collateral    Stipulation,    and   if   the    super-priority
                  administrative  claim status for the  Fitzgeralds  Undertaking
                  Expense  Reimbursement  in respect of the Lien in favor of the
                  Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Senior
                  Secured Notes is obtained by a separate  motion  brought under
                  ss.364(c)(1)  of the  Bankruptcy  Code  (as  opposed  to being
                  provided  in the Cash  Collateral  Stipulation),  then for the
                  purpose of this  Agreement  the term Interim  Cash  Collateral
                  Order shall also include the interim  Order of the  Bankruptcy
                  Court  granting  such  motion;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  in either
                  event, the super-priority administrative claim status for such
                  Expense Reimbursement shall be considered a post-petition loan
                  entitled to the  protection  of ss.  364(e) of the  Bankruptcy
                  Code.
