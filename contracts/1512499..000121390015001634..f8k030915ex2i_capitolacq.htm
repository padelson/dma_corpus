Article III. 
 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

  

3.1 _Conversion of Shares of Company Stock_ _and Options_.

  

(a) At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the Initial Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of Common Stock, (i) each share
(a " _Common Share_ ") of Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the First Effective Time (other than (x) shares of
Common Stock, if any, held in the treasury of the Company, which treasury
shares shall be canceled as part of the Mergers, and (y) shares of Common
Stock, if any, owned by the Company's Subsidiaries, which shares shall be
converted into that number of shares of common stock, no par value per share,
of the Interim Corporation that bears the same ratio to the aggregate number
of outstanding shares of common stock, no par value per share, of the Interim
Corporation immediately after the First Effective Time as the number of
shares of Common Stock held by such Subsidiaries bore to the aggregate number
of outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the First
Effective Time, which shares described in clauses (x) and (y) shall not
constitute "Common Shares" hereunder), shall thereupon be converted into and
become the right to receive the applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration, as determined pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_, and (ii)
each option to purchase shares of Common Stock that is unexercised and
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time (each an " _Option_
") shall thereupon be canceled and converted into and become the right to
receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, as determined
pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_.

  

(b) At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the Initial Merger and
without any action on the part of Acquiror, LLC Sub or Merger Sub, each share
of common stock, no par value per share, of Merger Sub shall be converted
into one share of common stock, no par per share, of the Interim Corporation.

  

(c) The " _Merger_ _Consideration_ " shall comprise collectively (i)
the Cash Merger Consideration, (ii) the Acquiror Common Stock Consideration
and (iii) the Converted Options (if any).

  

(d) At the First Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall be
allocated among the Lindblad Owners as set forth below in this _Section
3.1(d),_ subject to the Cash Election described below in _Section 3.1(g)_ :
(i) each Lindblad Owner of Common Shares shall be entitled to receive in
respect of each Common Share held by such Lindblad Owner immediately prior to
the First Effective Time (A) the Per Share Cash Consideration and (B) the Per
Share Common Share Consideration; and (ii) each Lindblad Owner of Options
shall be entitled to receive in respect of each such Option held by such
Lindblad Owner immediately prior to the First Effective Time an option to
acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the
corresponding Option immediately prior to the First Effective Time (but not
including the anti-dilution protection provisions thereof), a number of shares
of Acquiror Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share, determined
by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Option
immediately prior to the First Effective Time (determined without regard to
any applicable anti-dilution protection provisions thereof) by the Conversion
Ratio, at a per share exercise price, rounded up to the nearest whole cent,
determined by dividing the per share exercise price of such Option, by the
Conversion Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, the adjustments provided in this _Section
3.1_ with respect to the Options (whether or not they are "incentive stock
options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be effected in a manner
that is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code and Section 409A of the
Code.

   

16 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(e) All of the shares of Common Stock and Options converted into the
right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Article III shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate previously representing any such shares of Common Stock shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities, except
the right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration into which such
shares of Common Stock shall have been converted in the Initial Merger.

  

(f) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Subsequent Merger and
without any action on the part of LLC Sub, the Interim Corporation, the
Surviving Company, Acquiror or the holder of any equity interests of the
Interim Corporation or the Surviving Company, each share of common stock in
the Interim Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

  

(g) Each Lindblad Owner shall be entitled to elect to receive, with
respect to all such Lindblad Owner's Common Shares, a portion of applicable
Merger Consideration in the form of cash (the " _Cash Election_ "), with the
remaining percentage provided in Acquiror Common Stock Consideration in
accordance with _Section 3.1(d) _ and the definition of "Stock Election".
Each Lindblad Owner shall make his, her or its Cash Election in a signed,
written notice delivered to Acquiror on the date hereof, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Acquiror, declaring such Lindblad Owner's
irrevocable Cash Election (each, a " _Cash Election Statement_ "). To the
extent the collective Cash Elections of all Lindblad Owners would result in a
value either greater or less than value of the Cash Merger Consideration,
then (i) such amount that is either greater or less than the amount of Cash
Merger Consideration shall be allocated to or subtracted from, as applicable,
each Lindblad Owner pro rata based on such Lindblad Owner's initial
Cash Election relative to all Cash Elections, and (ii) each such Lindblad
Owner's Cash Election shall be adjusted correspondingly to reflect the
percentage equal to the quotient of (A) the resulting amount of the Cash
Merger Consideration to which such Lindblad Owner is entitled after the
adjustment in foregoing clause (i), _divided by_ (B)(1) the number of Common
Shares owned by such Lindblad Owner _multiplied by_ (2) Per Share
Consideration.

  

3.2 _Payment and Exchange of Certificates_.

  

(a) At the First Effective Time, Acquiror shall pay or deliver or
cause to be paid to each Lindblad Owner in accordance with _Section 3.1(d)_
(x) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
in writing by such Lindblad Owner no less than three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, an amount (collectively, the " _Funding Amount_ ") equal
to such Lindblad Owner's Per Share Cash Consideration in respect of each
Common Share beneficially owned by such Lindblad Owner immediately prior to
the First Effective Time and (y) stock certificates representing such
Lindblad Owner's Per Share Common Share Consideration, in each case, in
respect of each Common Share beneficially owned by such Lindblad Owner
immediately prior to the First Effective Time.

5.6 _Financial Ability; Trust Account_.

  

(a) There is at least $200,000,000 (less, as of the Closing, payments
to stockholders of Acquiror who have validly exercised their right to receive
payment pursuant to the Offer) invested in a trust account at J.P. Morgan
Securities (the " _Trust Account_ "), maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer and Trust Company, a New York corporation, acting as trustee (the "
_Trustee_ "), pursuant to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated May
10, 2013, by and between Acquiror and the Trustee (the " _Trust Agreement_
"). Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account may be
released except in accordance with the Trust Agreement, Acquiror
Organizational Documents and Acquiror's final prospectus dated May 10, 2013.
Amounts in the Trust Account are invested in United States Government
securities or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule
2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
Acquiror has performed all material obligations required to be performed by
it to date under, and is not in material default or delinquent in
performance or any other respect (claimed or actual) in connection with, the
Trust Agreement, and no event has occurred which, with due notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute such a default thereunder. There are no claims
or proceedings pending with respect to the Trust Account. Since May 15, 2013,
Acquiror has not released any money from the Trust Account (other than
interest income earned on the principal held in the Trust Account as
permitted by the Trust Agreement). As of the Effective Time, the obligations
of Acquiror to dissolve or liquidate pursuant to the Acquiror Organizational
Documents shall terminate, and as of the Effective Time, Acquiror shall have
no obligation whatsoever pursuant to the Acquiror Organizational Documents to
dissolve and liquidate the assets of Acquiror by reason of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and following the Effective Time, no
Acquiror Stockholder shall be entitled to receive any amount from the Trust
Account except to the extent such Acquiror Stockholder is a Converting
Stockholder or is seeking repayment of outstanding promissory notes for
amounts advanced by such Acquiror Stockholder to Acquiror for
Acquiror's working capital needs prior to the Effective Time.

  

(b) As of the date hereof, and assuming the rights of the holders of
Acquiror Common Stock to cause Acquiror to redeem their shares of Acquiror
Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Acquiror Organizational Documents are
not exercised, available cash in the Trust Account is sufficient for Merger
Sub, LLC Sub and the Surviving Company to complete the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all fees, prepayment
premiums, costs (including breakage costs and termination amounts) and
expenses required to be paid by Acquiror, LLC Sub or Merger Sub in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date hereof,
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
contained herein and the compliance by the Company with its obligations
hereunder, none of Acquiror, LLC Sub nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe
that any of the conditions to the use of funds in the Trust Account will not
be satisfied or funds available in the Trust Account will not be available to
Acquiror, LLC Sub and Merger Sub on the Closing Date.

  

5.7 _Brokers ' Fees_. Except fees described on _Schedule 5.7_

defraud either present or future creditors. Assuming that the representations
and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement are true and
correct in all material respects, and after giving effect to the Mergers, at
and immediately after the Effective Time, each of Acquiror and the Surviving
Company and each of its Subsidiaries (a) will be solvent (in that both the
fair value of its assets will not be less than the sum of its debts and that
the present fair saleable value of its assets will not be less than the
amount required to pay its probable liability on its recourse debts as they
mature or become due), (b) will have adequate capital and liquidity with
which to engage in its business and (c) will not have incurred and does not
plan to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature or become due.

registration statements, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since May 15, 2013
(collectively, as they have been amended since the time of their filing and
including all exhibits thereto, the " _SEC Reports_ "). None of the SEC
Reports, as of their respective dates (or if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, then on the
date of such filing), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. The audited financial statements
and unaudited interim financial statements (including, in each case, the
notes and schedules thereto) included in the SEC Reports complied as to form
in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto and except with respect to unaudited
statements as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly present (subject,
in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements included therein, to
normal year-end adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes) in all
material respects the financial position of Acquiror as of the respective
dates thereof and the results of their operations and cash flows for the
respective periods then ended.

  

(b) Acquiror has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to Acquiror is made known to Acquiror's principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared. To Acquiror's knowledge, such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective in timely alerting Acquiror's principal
executive officer and principal financial officer to material information
required to be included in Acquiror's periodic reports required under the
Exchange Act.

  

(c) Acquiror has established and maintained a system of internal
controls. To Acquiror's knowledge, such internal controls are sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Acquiror's financial
reporting and the preparation of Acquiror's financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP.

Sub or to which Acquiror, LLC Sub or Merger Sub is a party which has or would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or impairing any
business practice of Acquiror, any acquisition of property by Acquiror or
the conduct of business by Acquiror as currently conducted or as contemplated
to be conducted as of the Closing other than such effects, individually or in
the aggregate, which have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the ability of Acquiror, LLC Sub or Merger
Sub to enter into and perform their obligations under this Agreement.

  

(b) Except for Merger Sub and LLC Sub, Acquiror does not own directly
or indirectly any interest or investment (whether equity or debt) in any
corporation, partnership, joint venture, business, trust or other entity.

  

5.11 _Proxy Statement_. None of the information to be included in
the Proxy Statement (other than any information provided by or on behalf of
the Company or its Subsidiaries) will, as of the date the Proxy Statement (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to Acquiror's
stockholders, at the time of the Special Meeting, or at the Effective Time,
contain any statement which, at the time and in light of the circumstances
under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein not false or misleading in any material respect.

  

5.12 _No Outside Reliance_. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this _Article V_ or any other provision hereof, each of Acquiror, LLC Sub and
Merger Sub, and any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, partners, members or representatives, acknowledge and agree

presentations that have been or shall hereafter be provided to Acquiror or any
of its Affiliates, agents or representatives are not and will not be deemed
to be representations or warranties of the Company, and no representation or
warranty is made as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing
except as may be expressly set forth in this Agreement. Except as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, Acquiror understands and
agrees that any inventory, equipment, Vessels, assets, properties and
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries are furnished "as is", "where is"
and subject to and except as otherwise provided in the representations and
warranties contained in _Article IV_ or any certificate delivered in

the Company contained in the Proxy Statement to be incorrect or inaccurate
in any material respect; _provided_ , _that_ , if any such action shall be
taken or fail to be taken or such development shall otherwise occur,

made to the Proxy Statement such that such information is no longer incorrect
or inaccurate in any material respect with respect to any information
concerning the Company required to be included in the Proxy Statement;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that no information received by Acquiror
hereto pursuant to this _Section 6.9_ shall operate as a waiver or otherwise
affect any representation, warranty or agreement given or made by the party

deliver, among other items, to its equity holders a disclosure statement
intended to satisfy the shareholder approval requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code. The form of waiver, solicitation of approval, and
disclosure materials shall be subject to the approval of Acquiror, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

efforts to consummate the Restructuring prior to the Closing Date as set
forth on _Annex A_ , and shall not amend, modify or waive any provision of any
agreement related to the Restructuring or the steps set forth on _Annex A_
without the prior written consent of Acquiror.

practicable (but in any event prior to the Termination Date) and any and all
action necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the

7.2 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
the Company and its Subsidiaries against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been
permitted under applicable Law and its respective certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents in effect on the
date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (including the advancing of
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law). Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror shall cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries (i) to maintain for a period of not less than
six years from the Effective Time provisions in its certificate
of incorporation, bylaws and other organizational documents concerning the
indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating to expense
advancement) of the Surviving Company's and its Subsidiaries' former and
current officers, directors, employees, and agents that are no less favorable
to those Persons than the provisions of the certificates of incorporation,
bylaws and other organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, in each case, as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) not to
amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would
adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case,
except as required by Law. Acquiror shall assume, and be liable for, and
shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to honor, each of the
covenants in this _Section 7.2_.

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time,
Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Company to maintain in effect directors'
and officers' liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently
covered by the Company's or its Subsidiaries' directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies (true, correct and complete copies of
which have been heretofore made available to Acquiror or its agents or
representatives) on terms not less favorable than the terms of such current
insurance coverage, except that in no event shall Acquiror be required to pay
an annual premium for such insurance in excess of 250% of the aggregate annual
premium payable by the Company for such insurance policy for the year ended
December 31, 2014; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) Acquiror or the
Surviving Company may cause coverage to be extended under the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail"
policy containing terms not materially less favorable than the terms of such
current insurance coverage with respect to claims existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) if any claim is asserted or made within
such six-year period, any insurance required to be maintained under this
_Section 7.2_ shall be continued in respect of such claim until the final
disposition thereof.

contrary, this _Section 7.2_ shall survive the consummation of the Mergers
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on Acquiror and the
Surviving Company and all successors and assigns of Acquiror and the
Surviving Company. In the event that Acquiror or the Surviving Company or any
of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Acquiror and the Surviving Company shall ensure that proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section 7.2_.

information in the Proxy Statement shall have become false or misleading and
cause the Proxy Statement, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of shares of Acquiror Common
Stock, in each case pursuant to the Federal Securities Laws and subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Acquiror Organizational
Documents. Acquiror shall provide the Company with copies of any written
comments, and shall inform the Company of any material oral comments, that
Acquiror receives from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall give the
Company a reasonable opportunity under the circumstances to review and
comment on any proposed written or material oral responses to such
comments. Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the

registration, value added or other similar Taxes incurred in connection with
the Mergers. The Company shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax
Returns with respect to all such Taxes, and, if required by applicable Law,
Acquiror and Lindblad Owners will join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns.

  

(b) Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment.

  

(i)  Acquiror, the Company, Merger Sub and LLC Sub intend that the
Initial Merger and the Subsequent Merger, considered together as a single
integrated transaction for United States federal income Tax purposes, shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, and each shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Initial Merger and the Subsequent Merger
to so qualify and shall file all Tax Returns consistent with, and take no
position inconsistent with (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise), such
treatment unless required to do so by applicable Law. Each of the parties
further agrees to promptly notify the other party of any challenge to the
Intended Tax Treatment by any Governmental Authority.

or recess of the meeting);

  

(e) by written notice from the Company to Acquiror (i) within two (2)
Business Days of April 20, 2015 (the " _Debt Commitment Target Date_ "), if
despite its reasonable best efforts to obtain a debt commitment letter, on
customary terms reasonably acceptable to the Company and Acquiror, for not
less than eighty million dollars ($80,000,000) in the aggregate (the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ "), the Company has failed to obtain such Debt
Commitment Letter; provided, however, that such termination right shall
expire should the Company thereafter obtain the Debt Commitment Letter on such
terms prior to exercise of such right or (ii) within two (2) Business Days of
May 1, 2015 (" _Debt Financing Target Date_ "), if despite its

their respective Subsidiaries relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby. No representations, warranties, covenants, understandings,
agreements, oral or otherwise, relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement exist between the parties except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

11.10 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole
or in part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed in the
same manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement.
The approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of any of the parties shall

party to enter into an amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
11.10_.

  

11.11 _Publicity_. All press releases or other public communications
of any nature whatsoever relating to the transactions contemplated by this

11.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The

intent of the parties.

arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions

exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such Action, waives any
objection it may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to

Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in any other court. Nothing herein contained shall be
deemed to affect the right of any party to serve process in any
manner permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed
against any other party in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce
judgments obtained in any Action brought pursuant to this _Section 11.13_.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (AND IN THE CASE OF ACQUIROR, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF
AND EACH ACQUIROR PARTY) HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL

11.14 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the parties do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement)
in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to
an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.1_ , this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement, and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right,
neither the Company nor Acquiror would have entered into this Agreement. Each
party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have an
adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The parties acknowledge
and agree that any party seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this Section shall not be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection with any such injunction.

  

11.15 _Non-Recourse_. Without limiting the rights of the Company under
and to the extent provided under _Section 11.14_ , this Agreement may only be
enforced against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out
of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may
only be brought against, the entities that are expressly named as parties
hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein
with respect to such party. Without limiting the rights of the Company under
and to the extent provided under _Section 11.14_ , except to the extent a
named party to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the specific
obligations undertaken by such named party in this Agreement), (i) no past,
present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any named party to this Agreement and (ii) no past, present or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in
contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of the Company or Acquiror under this
Agreement of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

11.16 _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. None
of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this
Agreement or in any instrument, document or certificate delivered pursuant to
this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time and shall expire upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time, except for those covenants and agreements
contained herein and therein which by their terms expressly apply in whole or
in part after the Effective Time and then only to such extent.
