CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; PAYMENT  OF AGGREGATE
MERGER CONSIDERATION   3.1 Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") or any
shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:   (a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub.
Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation and such shares shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time.   (b)
Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of Company
Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (c) Capital Stock
of Company. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Dissenting Shares and
those shares cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(b), shall automatically be
converted into the right to receive, upon surrender of the certificate (a
"Certificate") representing such share of Company Common Stock, an amount in
cash equal to the Total Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, as
provided herein (subject to the Per Share Escrow Contributions with respect
to each such share being deposited with the Escrow Agents and being held and
distributed in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreements). At
the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Total Per Share
Merger Consideration with respect to each share represented by such
Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (subject to the
Per Share Escrow Contributions with respect to each such share being
deposited with the Escrow Agents and being held and distributed in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreements).   (d) Dissenting Shares. No
Dissenting Share shall be converted into the right to receive any of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration unless the applicable holder of such
Dissenting Share shall have forfeited its right to appraisal under the DGCL,
or properly withdrawn its demand for appraisal, with respect to such
Dissenting Share. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to    
12     receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. If any holder of Dissenting
Shares has forfeited or properly withdrawn its right to appraisal of such
Dissenting Shares, then, (i) as of the occurrence of such event, such
Dissenting Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted
into and represent the right to receive the Total Per Share Merger
Consideration payable in respect of each such share of Company Common Stock
(subject to the Per Share Escrow Contributions with respect to each such
share being deposited with the Escrow Agents and being held and distributed
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreements) pursuant to, and in
accordance with the provisions of, Section 3.2, and (ii) promptly following
the occurrence of such event, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall, or
shall cause the Exchange Agent to, deliver to such holder promptly after
receipt from such holder of a duly executed letter of transmittal and
surrendered Certificates, a payment representing the Closing Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2. The
Company (and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall serve
prompt notice to Parent (and after the Effective Time, the
Stockholder Representative) of any demands received by the Company (or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be) for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company (and after the
Effective Time, the Stockholder Representative) shall have the sole right to
direct any negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands, and to
settle or otherwise reach an agreement with respect to any such demands, with
the applicable holder of Dissenting Shares; provided however that Parent
shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands, and any settlement or agreement with respect to any
such demands shall be subject to the consent of Parent, not to be
unreasonably withheld. In the event any such appraisal of Dissenting Shares
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL assigns a value to any Dissenting
Share in excess of the Total Per Share Merger Consideration, or the Company
or the Stockholder Representative settles any such demands in excess of the
Total Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to any Dissenting Share,
such excess amount (the "Appraisal Excess Amount") shall (A) to the extent it
is paid to the holder of such Dissenting Share on the Closing Date, form part
of Company Transaction Expenses and (B) to the extent it is paid to the
holder of such Dissenting Share after the Closing Date, be paid solely from
the Indemnity Escrow Deposit.   3.2 Exchange Fund; Exchange of Certificates;
Payment of Merger Consideration.   (a) Exchange Agent. As of the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with Mellon Investor Services LLC or such other
bank or trust company of similar size as may be designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for exchange in
accordance with Articles III and IV, through the Exchange Agent, an amount in
cash (the "Exchange Fund") equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration less
(i) the Indemnity Escrow Deposit, and (ii) the Stockholder Escrow Deposit. As
of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent an amount
equal to the Closing Payoff Amount or, if directed by the Company, make
payment of the Closing Payoff Amount to the Persons entitled to receive the
Closing Payoff Amount. If Parent shall deposit the Closing Payoff Amount with
the Exchange     13     Agent, the Exchange Agent shall deposit with
the Surviving Corporation on the Closing Date an amount equal to the Closing
Payoff Amount or shall, if directed by the Surviving Corporation, make
payments directly to the Persons entitled to receive the Closing Payoff
Amount.   (b) Exchange Procedures; Right to Receive Merger Consideration.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail or cause to be delivered to each holder of record
of a Certificate, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be substantially
in the form of Exhibit 3.2(b), together with changes reasonably requested by
the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering such
Certificate in exchange for the Total Per Share Merger Consideration payable
with respect to each share of Company Common Stock represented by
such Certificate (subject to the Per Share Escrow Contributions with respect
to each such share being deposited with the Escrow Agents and being held and
distributed in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreements). At or
after the Effective Time, upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the Total Per Share
Merger Consideration, less the Per Share Escrow Contributions, with respect
to each share of Company Common Stock then held by such holder under such
Certificate so surrendered (such Total Per Share Merger Consideration, less
the Per Share Escrow Contributions, with respect to all shares represented by
such Certificate, the "Closing Merger Consideration"), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue on any cash payable hereunder to holders of Company Common Stock
(except with respect to the Escrow Deposits in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreements). In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the Closing Merger Consideration with respect to such shares may be
issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if, upon presentation to the Exchange Agent, such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Closing Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
3.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Closing Merger
Consideration with respect to such Certificate (and the Per Share
Escrow Contributions with respect to each share represented by such
Certificate subject to, and in accordance with, the terms of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreements).   (c) Payment of Merger Consideration. The
applicable Closing Merger Consideration shall be paid, without interest, to
holders of Company Common Stock promptly following valid tender of
Certificates and the appropriately completed letter of transmittal (and on
the Closing Date for Certificates accompanying appropriately completed
letters of transmittal validly tendered at least two Business Days prior to
the     14     Effective Time) by check or, in the case of a holder
who receives at least $25,000 of Closing Merger Consideration, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing
by such holder.   3.3 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.
The Aggregate Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
Article III and Article IV (including the deposit of the Escrow Deposits
pursuant to Section 4.3) shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to all shares of Company Common Stock
(and all Vested Options), and after the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article III.   3.4 Termination of Exchange
Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
holders of Certificates for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate who has not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to
Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of any such holder\'s
claim for the Closing Merger Consideration with respect to such Certificate,
without interest thereon, in accordance with this Article III. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on
which any Closing Merger Consideration with respect thereto would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Body, any such Closing
Merger Consideration (and the portion of the Escrow Indemnity Deposit equal
to the aggregate Per Share Indemnity Escrow Contributions with respect
to such Closing Merger Consideration) shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   3.5 Investment of
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest the then balance of any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis in
money market funds or securities issued or guarantied by the United States of
America. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall
be the property of, and shall be paid to, Parent.   3.6 Lost Certificates.
If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact (and, if required by Parent, upon the provision
of a contractual indemnity against any claims that may be made against Parent
or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate), by the Person
claiming to be the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Closing Merger Consideration to which such holder would be
entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(b) of this Agreement.     15     
3.7 Withholding Rights. The Exchange Agent (and to the extent any portion of
the Exchange Fund is distributed to Parent pursuant to Section 3.4, Parent)
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of any state
or foreign Law with respect to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent (or Parent, as
the case may be).   3.8 Fractional Shares. Fractional shares of Company
Common Stock shall be entitled to the Total Per Share Merger Consideration
(subject to the Per Share Escrow Contributions) on the same basis as whole
shares of Company Common Stock except that any amounts payable with respect
to such fractional shares (including the Total Per Share Merger Consideration
and the Per Share Escrow Contributions) shall be the amount otherwise payable
with respect to a whole share of Company Common Stock multiplied by the
applicable fraction of a share of Company Common Stock represented by such
fractional share.   ARTICLE IV - DETERMINATION OF AGGREGATE MERGER
CONSIDERATION;  OPTIONS; ESCROW; PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT   4.1
Determination of Aggregate Merger Consideration and Total Per Share Merger
Consideration.   (a) The "Aggregate Merger Consideration" shall be equal
to:   (i) $340,000,000;   (ii) minus Company Indebtedness (net of Company
Cash) (such amount, "Closing Net Indebtedness"); and   (iii) minus Company
Transaction Expenses.   The Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be subject
to adjustment prior to the Closing as provided in Sections 4.4(a) and (b).
The Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be subject to further adjustment
following the Closing pursuant to Sections 4.4(c) - (h).   (b) The "Total
Per Share Merger Consideration" shall be equal to X, where   X = AMC +
AOEA  --------------  CS + VO   and the abbreviations in the equation
above have the following meanings:     16      AMC: Aggregate Merger
Consideration;  AOEA: Aggregate Option Exercise Amount;   CS: Number of
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 3.1(b)); and   VO: Number of shares of Company Common Stock for
which the Vested Options are exercisable.   4.2 Options.   (a) At the
Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, (i) upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Exchange Fund
pursuant to Section 3.2(a), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deposit
with the Surviving Corporation from the Exchange Fund an amount of funds
equal to the Aggregate Option Consideration, (ii) each Vested Option which is
then outstanding shall be cancelled, (iii) in consideration of
such cancellation, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to the
holders of such cancelled Vested Options within two Business Days of the
Closing an amount in cash in respect of each Vested Option equal to the
product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such
Vested Option is exercisable, and (B) the excess of the Total Per Share
Merger Consideration (subject to any adjustment thereto pursuant to Sections
4.4(a) and (b)) over the exercise price of such Vested Option (such payment
to be net of Taxes required by Law to be withheld with respect thereto), and
(iv) any options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock which are not
Vested Options shall be cancelled without any right to receive consideration
with respect thereto.   (b) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed
to by the parties, the Company shall cause the Company\'s 1999 Amended and
Restated Equity Award Plan to terminate and any options, warrants or rights
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock, and securities convertible into
or exchangeable for shares of Company Common Stock, to be cancelled as of the
Effective Time without any right to acquire any equity securities of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of either of them.   4.3 Escrow
Deposits.   (a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit in escrow
with the Indemnity Escrow Agent $18,000,000 of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration (the "Indemnity Escrow Deposit"), which amount shall be held
and distributed in accordance with the terms of the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement. The Indemnity Escrow Deposit represents the aggregate of all of
the Per Share Indemnity Escrow Contributions, where "Per Share Indemnity
Escrow Contribution" means an amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow Deposit
divided by the total number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with Section 3.1(b)). An amount equal to the Banker\'s
Percentage of the Per Share Indemnity Escrow Contribution shall represent
contingent fees     17     owing to the Bankers if the Indemnity
Escrow Deposit is not otherwise subject to claims of Buyer Indemnified
Parties under the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and the remaining Per Share
Indemnity Escrow Contribution shall represent part of the Total Per Share
Merger Consideration distributable to the stockholders of the Company in
accordance with the terms of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement; provided,
however, that if the management bonus transactions referred to at item (b)(v)
of Schedule 8.2 (the "Proposed Transaction Bonuses") are adopted and approved
by the stockholders of the Company, then an amount equal to the Banker\'s
Percentage of the Per Share Indemnity Escrow Contribution shall represent
contingent fees owing to the Bankers if the Indemnity Escrow Deposit is not
otherwise subject to claims of Buyer Indemnified Parties under the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement, 8.5% of the Per Share Indemnity Escrow Contribution shall
represent a contingent portion of Proposed Transaction Bonuses if
the Indemnity Escrow Deposit is not otherwise subject to claims of Buyer
Indemnified Parties under the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and the remainder
shall represent part of the Total Per Share Merger Consideration
distributable to the stockholders of the Company in accordance with the terms
of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Contingent Expense Amounts included in the Indemnity Per Share Escrow
Contribution do not constitute consideration payable to holders of Company
Common Stock and such Contingent Expense Amounts shall either be paid to the
service providers entitled to them under the Engagement Letters or Proposed
Transaction Bonuses, as the case may be, or to Buyer Indemnified Parties
pursuant to the Indemnity Escrow Agreement.   (b) At the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit in escrow with an escrow agent determined by the
Stockholder Representative in its sole discretion (the "Stockholder Escrow
Agent" and, together with the Indemnity Escrow Agent, the "Escrow Agents")
$3,000,000 of the Aggregate Merger Consideration (the "Stockholder Escrow
Deposit" and together with the Indemnity Escrow Deposit, the "Escrow
Deposits"), pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreement concerning such
escrow to be entered into between the Stockholder Representative and the
Stockholder Escrow Agent (the "Stockholder Escrow Agreement" and, together
with the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, the "Escrow Agreements"). The
Stockholder Escrow Deposit represents the aggregate of all of the Per Share
Stockholder Escrow Contributions, where "Per Share Stockholder Escrow
Contribution" (and together with Per Share Indemnity Escrow Contribution, the
"Per Share Escrow Contributions") means an amount equal to the
Stockholder Escrow Deposit divided by the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.1(b)). An
amount equal to the Banker\'s Percentage of the Per Share Stockholder Escrow
Contribution shall represent contingent fees potentially owing to the Bankers
by the Company and the remaining Per Share Stockholder Escrow Contribution
shall represent part of the Total Per Share Merger Consideration
distributable to the stockholders of the Company in accordance with the terms
of the Stockholder Escrow Agreement; provided, however, that if the Proposed
Transaction Bonuses are adopted and approved by the stockholders of the
Company, then an amount equal to the Banker\'s Percentage of the Per Share
Stockholder Escrow Contribution shall represent contingent fees potentially
owing to the Bankers by the Company, 8.5% of the Per Share Stockholder Escrow
Contribution shall represent a contingent portion of Proposed Transaction
Bonuses and the remainder shall represent part of the Total Per Share Merger
Consideration distributable to the stockholders of the Company in accordance
with the terms of the Stockholder Escrow Agreement.     18      4.4
Purchase Price Adjustment.   (a) The parties agree that the determination of
the amount of Aggregate Merger Consideration was based on Net Assets as of
June 30, 2004 in the amount of $92,226,000 ("Target Net Assets") which
excludes from such calculation the net assets of McCurdy Radio Industries
Limited in the amount of $124,000, as of June 30, 2004. A calculation of such
Net Assets is set forth on Exhibit 4.4(1). No less than three Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent
for Parent\'s review an estimated balance sheet including the Company\'s good
faith estimate of (i) Closing Net Indebtedness, (ii) Company Transaction
Expenses, and (iii) Net Assets as of the close of business on the Closing
Date ("Estimated Net Assets").   "Net Assets" means the aggregate book value
of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding Cash), less the
aggregate book value of liabilities of the Company (excluding Closing Net
Indebtedness and Company Transaction Expenses), subject to the following: Net
Assets as of the close of business on the Closing Date (including Estimated
Net Assets and Closing Net Assets) shall be calculated in the same way, using
the same accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies, as the
line items comprising assets and liabilities included in Target Net Assets
and set forth on Exhibit 4.4(l) and which are in all material respects
consistent with GAAP and all accounting principles, practices, methodologies
and policies used in the preparation of the Draft 2003 Statements; provided
that:   (A) Net Assets as of the close of business on the Closing
Date (including the calculation of Estimated Net Assets and Closing Net
Assets) shall include the Transaction Tax Benefits notwithstanding that such
amounts were not included in Target Net Assets,   (B) in no case shall Net
Assets (including Estimated Net Assets and Closing Net Assets) include any
deferred tax asset in respect of net operating loss carryforwards, tax
credits or similar attributes other than the Transaction Tax Benefits,
and   (C) Net Assets as of the close of business on the Closing
Date (including Estimated Net Assets and Closing Net Assets) shall be
calculated such that the line item in Target Net Assets on Exhibit 4.4(1)
with respect to "Capitalized software cost, net" remains unchanged from the
amount stated in Target Net Assets.   "Transaction Tax Benefits" means
certain Tax benefits arising out of payments made or accrued by the Company
or its Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date, calculated in the manner
set forth in Exhibit 4.4(2), consisting exclusively of (A) payments made or
owing to the holders of Vested Options pursuant to Section 4.2 hereof, (B)
bonus payments made or owing to employees in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, to the extent there are any such bonus payments (the
"Transaction Bonuses"), and (C) other costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby which are deductible by
the Company as expenses for Federal Tax purposes (each a "Transaction-Related
Tax Deduction" and collectively the "Transaction-Related Tax Deductions").
The Contingent Expense Amounts shall be included in Transaction Tax Benefits
as if they were fully accrued and paid at Closing. Any dispute    
19     as to the deductibility of any Transaction-Related Tax Deduction
to be included in the calculation of Transaction Tax Benefits shall be
referred to and resolved by the Accounting Referee in connection with the
determination of Final Net Assets.   (b) If Estimated Net Assets is less
than Target Net Assets, then the Aggregate Merger Consideration payable at
the Closing will be decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of
such deficiency. If Estimated Net Assets is greater than Target Net Assets,
then the Aggregate Merger Consideration payable at the Closing will be
increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such excess.   (c)
As promptly as practicable, but no later than 60 days after the Closing Date,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to prepare and deliver to the
Stockholder Representative the Closing Statement and a certificate based on
such Closing Statement setting forth the Surviving Corporation\'s calculation
of Closing Net Assets. The closing statement (the "Closing Statement") shall
present the Net Assets as of the close of business on the Closing Date
("Closing Net Assets"). Closing Net Assets shall be determined using the same
accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies, as the line
items comprising assets and liabilities included in Target Net Assets and set
forth on Exhibit 4.4(l) (except as provided in the definition of
"Net Assets"). The adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration
contemplated by Section 4.4(g) is intended to show the change in Net Assets
from June 30, 2004 to the Closing Date, and the parties agree that such
change can only be measured if the calculation is done in the same way, using
the same methods, for both dates, subject to the acknowledgement of the
parties that the calculation of Target Net Assets attached as Exhibit 4.4(l)
did not include provision for the Transaction Tax Benefits.   (d) Upon the
Stockholder Representative\'s review of the Closing Statement, if the
Stockholder Representative disagrees with the Surviving Corporation\'s
calculation of Closing Net Assets delivered pursuant to Section 4.4(c), the
Stockholder Representative may, within 15 days after delivery of the Closing
Statement, deliver a notice to Parent disagreeing with such calculation and
setting forth the Stockholder Representative\'s calculation of such amount (a
"Notice of Disagreement"). Any such Notice of Disagreement shall specify
those items or amounts as to which the Stockholder
Representative disagrees.   (e) If a Notice of Disagreement shall be duly
delivered pursuant to Section 4.4(d), the Stockholder Representative and
Parent shall, during the 15 days following such delivery, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing Net
Assets. If during such period, the Stockholder Representative and Parent are
unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause
PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP or another nationally-recognized accounting firm
mutually acceptable to Parent and the Stockholder Representative (the
"Accounting Referee") to review this Agreement and the disputed items or
amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing Net Assets (it being
understood that in making such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall be
functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator). In making such
calculation, the Accounting Referee shall consider only those items or
amounts in the Closing Statement and the     20     Surviving
Corporation\'s calculation of Closing Net Assets as to which Stockholder
Representative has disagreed. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to the
Stockholder Representative and Parent, as promptly as practicable (but in any
case no later than 30 days from the date of engagement of the
Accounting Referee), a report setting forth its reasoned written decision;
provided however, that the Accounting Referee\'s determination as to any item
or amount disputed by the Stockholder Representative shall not be more
beneficial to Parent than the determination of that item or amount by Parent
in the Closing Statement nor more beneficial to the Stockholder
Representative than the determination of that item or amount in the Notice of
Disagreement. Such report shall be final and binding upon the Stockholder
Representative and Parent. The cost of such review and report shall be borne
equally by the Company\'s stockholders, on the one hand, and Parent, on the
other hand. The portions of the costs to be borne by the Company\'s
stockholders shall be paid out of the Indemnity Escrow Deposit.   (f)
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause their
Subsidiaries and respective representatives to, cooperate and assist in the
preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing
Net Assets and in the conduct of the review by each of the
Stockholder Representative and, if necessary, the Accounting Referee referred
to in Sections 4.4(d) and (e), respectively, including the making available
to the extent necessary or reasonably requested to verify the amounts set
forth in the Closing Statement of books, records, work papers and
personnel.   (g) If Final Net Assets is less than Estimated Net Assets
by over $250,000, then the Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be decreased
on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the full amount of such deficiency, and the
Company\'s stockholders shall pay Parent such amount in accordance with
Section 4.4(h). If Final Net Assets is greater than Estimated Net Assets by
more than $250,000, then the Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be
increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the full amount of such excess and
Parent shall pay the Company\'s stockholders such amount in accordance with
Section 4.4(h). In the event that Final Net Assets differs from Estimated Net
Assets by less than $250,000, there shall not be any adjustment to the
Aggregate Merger Consideration. "Final Net Assets" means Closing Net Assets
(i) as shown in the Surviving Corporation\'s calculation delivered pursuant
to Section 4.4(c) if no Notice of Disagreement with respect thereto is duly
delivered pursuant to Section 4.4(d); or (ii) if such a Notice of
Disagreement is delivered, (A) as agreed by the Stockholder Representative
and Parent pursuant to Section 4.4(e) or (B) in the absence of such
agreement, as shown in the Accounting Referee\'s calculation delivered
pursuant to Section 4.4(e).   (h) Any payment required to be made pursuant
to Section 4.4(g) shall be made at a mutually convenient time and place
within five Business Days after Final Net Assets has been determined by wire
transfer by Parent or the stockholders of the Company, as the case may be, of
immediately available funds to the account of such other party as may be
designated in writing by such other party. In the event that payments are to
be made to the Parent by the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Section
4.4(g), the Parent may demand payment therefor from each of the stockholders
of the Company and, if any such stockholder shall not have made such payment
within sixty     21     (60) days of the Parent\'s demand therefor,
Parent may at its sole option seek payment pursuant to Section 3.2(b) of the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement. In the event that payments are to be made to the
Company\'s stockholders by Parent pursuant to Section 4.4(g), such payments
are to be made to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Company\'s
stockholders.   (i) The excess of (i) any portion of amounts payable under
the Proposed Transaction Bonuses that is included in Company Transaction
Expenses but not paid to the designated employee over (ii) the amount by
which inclusion of such unpaid amount increased the Transaction Tax Benefits
that were included in Final Net Assets pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall be
paid to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Company\'s stockholders
and the remaining amount of unpaid Proposed Transaction Bonuses shall be paid
to Parent. Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall request under the
applicable escrow agreement relating to the Proposed Transaction Bonuses that
such amounts be so distributed.   (j) If a Contingent Expense Amount
included in the calculation of Transaction Tax Benefits is not paid to the
relevant service provider because funds are released from the Indemnity
Escrow Account in satisfaction of a claim made by Parent under the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement, the funds released from the Indemnity Escrow Account to
Parent with respect to such claim shall be increased by the amount by which
the inclusion of such unpaid Contingent Expense Amount increased the
Transaction Tax Benefits that were included in Final Net Assets pursuant to
this Section 4.4.   ARTICLE V - CLOSING AND TERMINATION   5.1 Closing
Date. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 9.1
and 9.2 hereof (or the waiver thereof by the party entitled to waive that
condition), the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges, LLP,
767 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10153 (or at such other place as Parent and
the Company may designate in writing) at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on a date
to be specified by Parent and the Company, which date shall be no later than
the fourth Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of each condition to
the Closing set forth in Article IX (other than conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), unless another time or date, or
both, are agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which
the Closing shall occur is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing
Date".   5.2 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated and
the Merger may be abandoned any time prior to the Effective Time as
follows:   (a) at the election of the Company or Parent on or
after December 31, 2004, if the Effective Time shall not have then occurred
by the close of business on such date, provided that neither Company nor
Parent shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement on or after December 31,
2004 if the principal reason the Merger shall not have been consummated by
such time is the willful, material breach by such party of its obligations
under this Agreement, and provided further that such date shall be
automatically extended for 60 days if only the conditions to Closing set
forth in Sections 9.1(d) and 9.2(d) remain unsatisfied or unwaived at
December 31, 2004; or     22      (b) by mutual written consent of
the Company and Parent; or   (c) by the Company or Parent if there shall be
in effect a final nonappealable Order of a Governmental Body of competent
jurisdiction restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby; it being agreed that the parties
hereto shall promptly appeal any adverse determination which is not
nonappealable (and pursue such appeal with reasonable diligence); or   (d)
by Parent if any of the conditions set forth in Sections 9.1(a) or 9.1(b) is
incapable of fulfillment, or if the breach giving rise to the failure of any
such conditions to be satisfied is capable of being cured, such breach shall
not have been cured within ten days following receipt by the Company of
notice of such breach from Parent, provided that Parent is not then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement; or   (e) by the Company if any
of the conditions set forth in Sections 9.2(a) or 9.2(b) is incapable of
fulfillment, or if the breach giving rise to the failure of any such
conditions to be satisfied is capable of being cured, such breach shall not
have been cured within ten days following receipt by Parent of notice of such
breach from the Company, provided that the Company is not then in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement.   5.3 Procedure Upon Termination. In the event
of termination of this Agreement by Parent or the Company, or both, pursuant
to Section 5.2 hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the
other party, and this Agreement shall terminate, and the Merger contemplated
hereby shall be abandoned, without further action by Parent or the
Company.   5.4 Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with Section 5.2, then each of the parties
shall be relieved of their duties and obligations arising under this
Agreement after the date of such termination and such termination shall be
without liability to Parent or the Company; provided, that no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto from liability for any willful
breach of this Agreement and, provided, further, that the obligations of the
parties set forth in Article XI hereof shall survive any such termination and
shall be enforceable hereunder and no termination shall impair the right of
any party to compel specific performance by any other party of its
obligations under Article XI (excluding Section 11.12) of this Agreement.

legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against it
in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors\' rights and
remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles
of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good    
24     faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is

transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or compliance by the Company
with any of the provisions hereof or thereof will conflict with, or result in
any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, or give rise to a right of acceleration, termination or
cancellation of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or to
increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements of
any Person under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the

individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b) No
consent, waiver, approval, Order, Permit or authorization of, or declaration
or filing with, or notification to, any Person (under any Contract or
otherwise) or Governmental Body is required on the part of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the Company Documents or the compliance by the Company or any of

rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and any other applicable
Antitrust Laws, (ii) approval by the shareholders of the Company of the
Merger in accordance with the DGCL and (iii) such consents, waivers,

of 1,500,000 shares of Company Common Stock. As of the date hereof, there
are 923,577 shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding and no

Except as set forth above and set forth in Schedule 6.4(a), there are no

("Voting Company Debt"). Except as set forth above and in Schedule 6.4(c), as
of the date of this Agreement, there are not any options, warrants, rights,
convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock
appreciation rights, stock-based performance units, commitments, Contracts,
arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound (i) obligating the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be
issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock or other equity
interests in, or any security convertible or exercisable for or exchangeable

occurring to holders of Company Common Stock. As of the date of this
Agreement, except as set forth in Schedule 6.4(d), there are not any
outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Schedule 6.4(e) sets forth a true and
correct list of all (i) holders of record of any Company Common Stock and the
number of shares held and (ii) outstanding options including holder, exercise
price, expiration date and vesting date.   6.5 Subsidiaries. Schedule 6.5
sets forth with respect to each Subsidiary of the Company, the number of
shares of its authorized capital stock, the number and class of shares
thereof duly issued and outstanding, the names of all stockholders or other
equity owners and the number of shares of stock owned by each stockholder or
the amount of equity owned by each equity owner. The outstanding shares of
capital stock of each Subsidiary of the Company are validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable, and all such shares or other equity interests
represented as being owned by Company or any of its Subsidiaries are owned by
it free and clear of any and all Liens. No shares of capital stock are held
by any Subsidiary of the Company as treasury stock. There is no existing
option, warrant, right or Contract to which any Subsidiary of the Company is
a party requiring, and there are no convertible securities of any Subsidiary
of the Company outstanding which upon conversion would require, the issuance
of any shares of capital stock or other equity interests of any Subsidiary of
the Company or other securities convertible into shares of capital stock or
other equity interests of any Subsidiary of the Company.   6.6 Financial
Statements. Schedule 6.6 sets forth (x) the draft audited consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2003 and

subject to normal year-end adjustments in the Ordinary Course of Business in
the case of any unaudited interim financial statements (including,
capitalization of software development costs). The Financial Statements have
been prepared, in each case, in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
during the periods involved, and in each case were compiled from the books
and records regularly maintained by the management of the Company used to
prepare financial statements of the Company in accordance with the principles
stated therein. The books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
fully reflect, in all material respects, the income, expenses, assets and
liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries and provide a fair and
accurate basis for the preparation of the Financial Statements.   For the
purposes hereof, the draft audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2003 is referred to as the "Balance
Sheet"; provided, however, that following delivery of the revised draft

or described, other than (i) Liabilities set forth on Schedule 6.7,
(ii) Liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business after the
Balance Sheet Date, (iii) Liabilities incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and set forth on Schedule 6.7, and (iv)

respective businesses only in the Ordinary Course of Business, and (ii) there

29     6.9 Taxes.   (a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) has
prepared in good faith and duly and timely filed (taking into account any
extension of time within which to file) all Tax Returns required to be filed
by it (other than those Tax Returns for which the failure to file would not,
individually or the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect) and all such
filed Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all material respects; (ii)
has timely paid all Taxes that are required to be paid by or with respect to
it and all Taxes that it is obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any
employee, creditor or third party, except with respect to matters contested
in good faith and adequately reserved on the Financial Statements in
accordance with GAAP or otherwise set forth on Schedule 6.9; and (iii) has
not waived any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to any
extension of time with respect to any Tax assessment or deficiency. As of the
date hereof, there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings in
respect of Taxes or Tax matters. There are not, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any claims concerning the Tax Liability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect except with respect to matters adequately reserved on the Financial
Statements in accordance with GAAP or otherwise set forth on Schedule 6.9.
The Company has made adequate provisions in the Financial Statements for all
Taxes that have accrued since December 31, 2003, but are not yet due. No
taxation authority has operated or agreed to operate any special Tax
arrangement (being a Tax arrangement which is not based on relevant
legislation, published practice or conversion) in relation to the affairs of
the Company or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has taken any action in respect of which any consent or
clearance from any taxation authority was required, except where such consent
or clearance was validly obtained and where any conditions relating thereto
were met. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has
distributed stock of another Person, or has had its stock distributed by
another Person, in a transaction intended to be governed in whole or in part
by Section 355 of the Code.   (b) Each Transaction-Related Tax Deduction, to
the extent included in the calculation of Transaction Tax Benefits used in
Final Net Assets, will be deductible by the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Parent, or their Affiliates or their successors for federal
income Tax purposes. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no
Transaction-Related Tax Deduction, to the extent included in the calculation
of Final Net Assets, will be disallowed under Section 280G of the Code
because it is an "excess parachute payment" as defined therein.   (c) This
Section 6.9 and (as they relate to Taxes) Section 6.6, Section 6.8(l),
Section 6.10, Section 6.13 and Section 6.20 represent the sole and exclusive
representations and warranties of the Company regarding Tax matters.   6.10
Real and Personal Property. (a) Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has, since January 1, 2000, owned, nor will own as of the
Closing Date, any real property or any option to acquire any real property.
All leases of real property as to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is the lessee or sublessee (the "Leased Real Property") and all
leases of personal property involving payments in excess of $200,000 per
annum to any Person as to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is the
lessee     30     or sublessee, are listed in Schedule 6.10(a). All
such leases are in full force and effect, are enforceable by the Company or
such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
the other parties thereto and have not been materially modified or amended.
There exists no material default by the Company or such Subsidiary, as the
case may be, under any of such leases or, to the Knowledge of the Company, by
any other party thereto, nor any event which, with the giving of notice or
the passage of time or both, would constitute a material event of default by
the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any other party thereunder.   (b) The Company and its
Subsidiaries have good and valid title to all the assets reflected on the
Balance Sheet or thereafter acquired, other than those set forth in Schedule
6.10(b) or otherwise disposed of since the date of the Balance Sheet in the
Ordinary Course of Business, in each case free and clear of all Liens, except
(i) such Liens as are set forth in Schedule 6.10(b) and (ii) Permitted
Exceptions.   6.11 Intellectual Property.   (a) Schedule 6.11(a) sets

any Contract or Permit to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which
any of the properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub are bound; (iii) any

the Disclosure Schedules hereto as supplemented or amended in accordance with
the terms hereof), and Parent acknowledges that, except for the
representations and warranties contained therein, the assets and the business

misrepresentation to Parent in connection with this Agreement, any claims
Parent may have for breach of representation or warranty shall be based
solely on the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in

amended in accordance with the terms hereof). Parent further acknowledges
that none of the Company, nor any of its respective Affiliates nor any other
Person has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the
accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not
expressly set forth in this Agreement, and none of the Company, any of its
Affiliates or any other Person will have or be subject to any liability to

required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the consents and approvals referred to in Sections 6.3(a), 6.3(b),
7.3(a) and (b) hereof, provided, however, that no party shall be obligated to
pay any consideration to any third party from whom consent or approval is

Company shall (i) make or cause to be made all filings required of each of
them or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates under the HSR Act
or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within five Business Days after
the date of this Agreement in the case of all filings required under the HSR
Act and within ten Business Days in the case of all other filings required by
other Antitrust Laws, (ii) comply at the earliest practicable date with any
request under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws for additional information,

inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or    48    other
Governmental Body under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or
any such transaction. Each such party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each such
party shall promptly inform the other parties hereto of any oral
communication with, and provide copies of written communications with, any
Governmental Body regarding any such filings or any such transaction. No
party hereto shall independently participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Body in

cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating to
proceedings under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws. Any party hereto may,
as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other parties under this Section 8.4 as
"outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein

amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and any other Laws or Orders that are designed to prohibit, restrict
or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade (collectively, the "Antitrust Laws"). In connection
therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as in
violation of any Antitrust Law, each of Parent and the Company shall
cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any
such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned
any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and
that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including by pursuing all available avenues
of administrative and judicial appeal and all available legislative action,
unless, by mutual agreement, Parent and the Company decide that litigation is
not in their respective best interests. Each of Parent and the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to
cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as
possible after the execution of this Agreement. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to take promptly any and all steps necessary
to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Laws that
may be asserted by any Federal, state and local and non-United States
antitrust or competition authority, so as to enable the parties to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as
possible;    49    provided that the foregoing shall not require any of
the parties hereto or their respective Affiliates to hold separate or
otherwise dispose of or conduct their respective businesses in a specified
manner, or agree to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct
its business in a specified manner.   8.5 Further Assurances; Closing Payoff
Amount. Each of Parent and the Company shall use (and the Company shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to use) commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take
all actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest
practicable date of all of the conditions to their respective obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Closing to occur. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall not, and
shall not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action
that would, or that would reasonably be expected to, result in any of the
conditions set forth in Article IX not being satisfied. Not later than three
Business Days prior to the Closing, in connection with the
Company\'s provision, pursuant to Section 4.4(a), of an estimated balance
sheet setting forth the Company\'s good faith estimate of (i) Closing Net
Indebtedness and (ii) Company Transaction Expenses (the amounts in clauses
(i) and (ii), collectively, the "Closing Payoff Amount"), the Company shall
provide to Parent a statement as to banking arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to Parent providing for a flow of funds that will result in the
payment in full at the Closing of the Closing Payoff Amount.   8.6
Confidentiality. The parties acknowledge that the information provided to it
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby is
subject to the terms of the nondisclosure agreement between Parent and the
Company dated September 26, 2003 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms
of which are incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon,
the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.   8.7
Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.   (a) From and after the Closing
Date, Parent agrees that all rights of the individuals who on or prior to the
Closing Date were directors or officers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "DandO; Indemnitees") to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Closing Date as provided in the respective certificate of incorporation
or by-laws or comparable organizational documents of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as now in effect, and any indemnification agreements or
arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to Dand O
Indemnitees shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to comply with the provisions of such certificate of
incorporation, by-laws, comparable organizational documents or other
indemnification agreements or arrangements. Such rights shall not be amended,
or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of
the DandO; Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by Law.   
50     (b) Each DandO; Indemnitee shall have the right (but not
the obligation) to control the defense of, including the investigation of,
any litigation, claim or proceeding (each, a "Claim") relating to any acts
or omissions covered under this Section 8.7 with counsel selected by such
DandO; Indemnitee; provided, however, that (i) Parent shall be permitted to
participate in the defense of such Claim at its own expense and (ii) Parent
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.   (c) In the event any
Claim is asserted or made, any determination required to be made with respect
to whether a DandO; Indemnitee\'s conduct complies with the standards set forth
under applicable Law, the applicable organizational documents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreements or arrangements
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall be made
by independent legal counsel selected by such DandO; Indemnitee and reasonably
acceptable to Parent.   (d) Each of Parent and the DandO; Indemnitee shall
cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense
of any Claim and shall provide reasonable access to properties and
individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.   (e) At the option of Parent:   (i) for the six-
year period commencing immediately after the Closing Date, Parent shall
maintain in effect the Company\'s current directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing
Date with respect to those persons who are currently covered by the
Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy on terms
with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable to the Company\'s
directors and officers currently covered by such insurance than those of such
policy in effect on the date hereof, provided that (A) Parent may substitute
therefor policies of a reputable insurance company the terms of which,
including coverage and amount, are no less favorable to such directors and
officers than the insurance coverage otherwise required under this
Section 8.7(e), (B) Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium
payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 200% of the
annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance
(such 200% amount, the "Maximum Premium"), and (C) if such insurance coverage
cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in
excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the most advantageous
policies of directors\' and officers\' insurance obtainable for an annual
premium equal to the Maximum Premium; or   (ii) Parent shall obtain by
Closing and thereafter maintain in effect a six-year "tail" directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policy covering acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Closing Date with respect to those persons who are currently
covered by the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
policy on    51    terms with respect to such coverage and amount no
less favorable to the Company\'s directors and officers currently covered by
such insurance than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof;
provided that such "tail" policy shall provide such coverage for six years
from the Closing Date and shall be obtained from the Company\'s current
insurance company or another reputable insurance company.   (f) The
provisions of this Section 8.7: (i) are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each DandO; Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his
or her representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have by Contract or otherwise.   (g) In the event that Parent or any of
its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this Section
8.7.   (h) The obligations of Parent under this Section 8.7 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
DandO; Indemnitee to whom this Section 8.7 applies without the consent of the
affected DandO; Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the DandO; Indemnitees
to whom this Section 8.7 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 8.7).   8.8 Publicity.   (a) Neither the Company nor Parent shall
issue any press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written
approval of the other party hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, unless, in the judgment of the Company or Parent, disclosure is
otherwise required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock
exchange on which Parent lists securities, provided that, to the extent
required by applicable Law, the party intending to make such release shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with applicable Law to
consult with the other party with respect to the text thereof. The Company
and Parent agree that the initial press release to be issued in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in a form mutually agreed
by them.   (b) Each of Parent and the Company agree that the terms of this
Agreement shall not be disclosed or otherwise made available to the

otherwise made available to the public, except where such disclosure,
availability or filing is in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent
required by applicable Law and only to the extent required by such Law;
provided that the parties acknowledge that Parent will be required to file a
Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
connection with the execution by Parent of this Agreement.    52

Closing, Parent covenants and agrees to continue the employment of the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employed immediately

in effect immediately prior to the Closing. Such individuals who continue
their employment with the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
following the Closing Date are hereinafter referred to as the "Continuing
Employees." Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to (i) require
Parent to employ the Continuing Employees for any definite period of time or
(ii) prohibit Parent from changing the title, position, responsibilities,
wages or other terms and conditions of employment of any Continuing Employee
at any time after the Closing Date at the discretion of Parent (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law).   (b) Benefits. For a period of 12 months
after the Closing Date, Parent shall make available to the Continuing
Employees who remain employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries, employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the
Company Benefit Plans in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. If and
to the extent Continuing Employees are afforded the opportunity to
participate in any Parent benefits plans ("Parent Benefit Plans"), for
purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual), Parent shall
credit each Continuing Employee with his or her years of service with the
Company, its Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities, to the same extent as
such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to
credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan or Foreign
Employee Benefit Plan; provided, however, that such service for eligibility
and vesting purposes shall not be credited for Continuing Employees with
respect to any Parent Benefit Plan established after the Closing Date if
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who are not Continuing Employees
are not credited with service prior to the establishment of the new Parent
Benefit Plan. The Parent Benefit Plans shall not deny Continuing Employees
coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions except to the extent such
coverage would have been denied by the Company Benefit Plans or
Foreign Employee Benefit Plans and shall credit such Continuing Employees for
any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid in the year of initial
participation in the Parent Benefit Plans. Nothing in this Agreement shall
require Parent to afford any Parent Benefit Plans to any employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries.  8.10 Shareholder Consent. The Company shall,
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, obtain the written
consent, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of not less
than a majority of the holders of Company Common Stock, approving and
adopting the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
(other than the Proposed Transaction Bonuses). The Company shall mail notice
of such approval to all holders of Company Common Stock who did not execute
such approval, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, no
later than ten days after the date such consent is obtained.   8.11
Supplementation and Amendment of Schedules.    53      (a) The Company
shall supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules as follows:   (i) with
respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered after the date of this
Agreement that, if existing or known on the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be set forth or described in the Disclosure Schedules,
but which the Company believes would not, individually or in the aggregate
with respect to all such matters, have a Material Adverse Effect, the Company
shall supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules at any time after the date
hereof after such matter is discovered by the Company, provided, however,
that (subject to the proviso below) there shall at the Parent\'s option be at
least five Business Days from the date of the last such supplement or
amendment to the Disclosure Schedules to the Closing Date; and provided
further that, if after the parties have scheduled a Closing Date, the Company
supplements or amends the Disclosure Schedules within five Business Days of
such date (which the Company is entitled to do), Parent shall have the
right to extend the scheduled Closing Date to the date that is five or fewer
Business Days after the date that the supplement or amendment was provided to
Parent by the Company, it being understood and agreed by the Company that
Section 5.2(a) shall be inapplicable during any such extension; and   (ii)
with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered after the date of
this Agreement that, if existing or known on the date of this Agreement,
would have been required to be set forth or described in the Disclosure
Schedules, and which the Company believes would, individually or in the
aggregate with respect to all such matters, have a Material Adverse Effect,
the Company shall supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule promptly, and
in any event not later than two Business Days, after such matter
is discovered by the Company.   No such supplement or amendment by the
Company shall have any effect on the satisfaction of the condition to closing
set forth in Section 9.1(a); provided, however, if the Closing shall occur,
then Parent shall be deemed to have waived any right or claim pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or otherwise, including pursuant to Article X hereof,
with respect to any and all matters disclosed pursuant to any such supplement
or amendment.   (b) Parent shall notify the Company promptly, and in any
event before Closing, if Parent has knowledge of any matter (a "Material
Breach Matter") the existence of which, individually or in the aggregate with
respect to all such matters, constitutes a material breach by the Company of
any representation or warranty in, or of Section 8.2 of, this Agreement. In
the event that Parent does not so notify the Company prior to Closing, if
the Closing shall occur, Parent shall be deemed to have waived any right or
claim pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, including
pursuant to Article X hereof, with respect to such Material Breach Matter.
For the purposes of this Section 8.11(b), Parent has "knowledge" of a
Material Breach Matter if any of the Persons identified on Exhibit 8.11(b)
has actual knowledge of such Material Breach Matter.    54     8.12 No
Solicitation. None of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor
shall any of them authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of or
any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other representative retained
by any of them to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or encourage
any Other Bid, (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Other Bid or
(iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to
any Person any information with respect to, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Other Bid. The Company shall
promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any Other Bid or any inquiry
with respect to or which could lead to any Other Bid and the identity of the
Person making any such Other Bid or inquiry. As used in this Section 8.12,
"Other Bid" shall mean any proposal for a merger, sale of a majority of the
Company\'s equity securities, sale of substantial assets or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any officer, director or employee of or
any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other representative retained
by any of them, with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Other Bid.   8.13 Delivery of Revised Draft Financial Statements. Prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall furnish to Parent and Merger Sub a
revised draft of the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2003, and the related consolidated statements
of income, stockholders\' equity and cash flow for the year ended December
31, 2003 (the "Revised 2003 Statements"). Other than immaterial differences
and a "subsequent events note," such Revised 2003 Statements shall in all
respects be identical to the Draft 2003 Statements. The Revised 2003
Statements shall be prepared so as to comply with Regulation S-X promulgated
under the Securities Act of 1933 in a manner mutually and reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company, except for the absence of an audit
report from Ernst and Young LLP.   8.14 Closing Date Operations. Except for
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to be operated after the Effective Time for the balance
of the day that constitutes the Closing Date in the Ordinary Course of
Business. The provisions of this Section 8.14 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Stockholder Representative.  
8.15 Tax Matters. Parent shall cause to be timely filed all Tax
Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the Surviving Corporation
that are due on or after the Closing Date and shall pay or cause to be paid
all Taxes due thereon.   ARTICLE IX - CONDITIONS TO CLOSING   9.1

Closing Conditions. Neither the Company nor Parent may rely on the failure of
any condition set forth in Sections 9.1 or 9.2, as the case may be, if such
failure was caused by such party\'s failure to comply with any provision of
this Agreement.   ARTICLE X - SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION   10.1 Survival
Past Closing. (a) The obligation to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnified Parties hereto pursuant to Sections 10.2(a) and 10.2(b) shall
terminate on the date which is one year after the Closing Date; provided,
however, that (i)    57    such obligation to indemnify and hold
harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which a Buyer
Indemnified Party shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period,
previously made a claim by delivering a notice of such claim (stating in
reasonable detail the basis of such claim) to the Stockholder Representative
in accordance with the terms of this Article X, and (ii) such limitation on
the obligation to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall not apply with respect to claims of, or causes of action arising from,
willful breach by the Company of this Agreement or fraud committed by the
Company on Parent in connection with this Agreement.   (a) Parent\'s right
to indemnification under this Article X shall not be affected by any
investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation of the Company except that, in the event that Parent
has knowledge (as knowledge is defined in Section 8.11(b)) of, and does not
notify the Company of, any Material Breach Matter prior to Closing
in accordance with Section 8.11(b), Parent shall be deemed to have waived any
right or claim pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise,
including pursuant to Article X hereof, with respect to such Material Breach
Matter.   10.2 Indemnification for Parent, Merger Sub and Surviving
Corporation.   (a) Subject to Section 10.4 below, Parent, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, Subsidiaries and Affiliates (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnified Parties") shall be indemnified, defended, protected and held
harmless from and against any and all Liabilities, losses, damages,
diminution in value, claims, Legal Proceedings, Orders, fines, penalties,
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' and accountants\' fees
(collectively, "Losses") incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties, arising
out of or resulting from:   (i) any breach of any representation or warranty
made by the Company contained in this Agreement (including as modified by
the Disclosure Schedules), any Company Document or other certificate or
statement delivered pursuant hereto ; and   (ii) the nonperformance of any
covenant or obligation to be performed prior to the Closing Date by the
Company under this Agreement, any Company Document or other document
delivered pursuant hereto.   (b) Notwithstanding Section 10.03(a), the
Surviving Corporation shall be indemnified on a dollar-for-dollar basis to
the extent (i) (A) the Closing Net Indebtedness or the amount of the Company
Transaction Expenses exceeds the amount of Closing Net Indebtedness or the
amount of Company Transaction Expenses, as applicable, set forth in the
estimated balance sheet of the Company provided to Parent pursuant to Section
4.4(a) (any such excess amount, an "Excess Amount") or (B) the consideration
to be received by any holder of a Dissenting Share includes the
Appraisal    58    Excess Amount with respect to such Dissenting Share
and the Appraisal Excess Amount was not included in Company Transaction
Expenses in accordance with Section 3.1(d), or (C) any Loss results from a
breach of Section 6.4 as a result of the matters disclosed at item 2 of
Schedule 6.4(e) (the amount of any such Loss referred to as a "Capitalization
Claim"), and (ii) following the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation pays such Excess Amount or Appraisal Excess Amount or
Capitalization Claim.   (c) Any amounts to be paid to the Buyer Indemnified
Parties pursuant to this Article X shall be made from the Indemnity Escrow
Deposit in accordance with the terms of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and
Parent hereby waives on its own behalf and on behalf of the other Buyer
Indemnified Parties any right to seek payment from the Company\'s
stockholders or any of the Company\'s Affiliates with respect thereto.  
10.3 Limitation on Indemnification.   (a) Deductible. The Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Losses under Section
10.02(a)(i) until the Buyer Indemnified Parties have incurred aggregate
Losses in excess of $1,000,000 (the "Deductible"). At such time as the
aggregate Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall exceed the
Deductible, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to receive the
amount of Losses in excess of the Deductible.   (b) Liability Cap. The Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Losses
(including pursuant to Section 10.2(a) and (b)) in excess of the amount of
the Indemnity Escrow Deposit held by the Indemnity Escrow Agent from time to
time pursuant to the Indemnity Escrow Agreement (the "Cap") provided,
however, this Cap shall not apply to claims of, or causes of action arising
from, willful breach by the Company of this Agreement or fraud committed by
the Company on Parent in connection with this Agreement.   (c) Any claim
for indemnification for breach of the representation in Section 6.9(b) (i)
shall be zero with respect to any Transaction-Related Tax Deduction to the
extent that the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
Affiliates or successors do not claim, or do not properly claim, a deduction
for it, and (ii) with respect to any particular Transaction-Related Tax
Deduction, shall in no event exceed the excess of (x) the amount of
Transaction Tax Benefits included in Final Net Assets as originally
determined pursuant to Section 4.4 (including the Transaction Tax Benefit in
respect of such Transaction-Related Tax Deduction) over (y) the amount of
Transaction Tax Benefits which would be included in the calculation of Final
Net Assets after excluding such Transaction-Related Tax Deduction (or portion
thereof) for which a Tax deduction was not allowed. Any dispute as to whether
the Company has properly claimed a deduction for a Transaction-Related Tax
Deduction on a Tax Return shall be referred to and resolved by the Accounting
Referee.   10.4 Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing Date, the
provisions of this Article X shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for
monetary damages arising out of or resulting from the breach of any
representations, warranties or covenants made by the    59    Company
pursuant to this Agreement (other than claims of, or causes of action arising
from, willful breach by the Company of this Agreement or fraud committed by
the Company on Parent in connection with this Agreement) and the
Indemnity Escrow Deposit held by the Indemnity Escrow Agent pursuant to the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement shall be the sole source of funds to satisfy
claims under this Article X.   10.5 Indemnification Procedures.   (a) If
any Buyer Indemnified Party shall, after the Closing Date, become aware of
any matter which such party (the "Indemnitee") has determined has given or
could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement that does
not involve a third party claim, the Indemnitee shall promptly give the
Stockholder Representative written notice of such claim, stating the amount
of the Losses, if known, and method of computation thereof, all with
reasonable particularity and including documentary proof, if available, and
containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect
of which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises; provided,
however, that failure to so notify the Stockholder Representative shall not
preclude the Indemnitee from any indemnification which it may claim, except
to the extent that the Stockholder Representative shall have been actually
and materially prejudiced by such failure. In accordance with Section
10.1(a), all claims for indemnification under this Article X must be made
within one year from the date hereof.   (b) If an Indemnitee shall receive
notice of any claim by a third party which is or may be subject to
indemnification, the following procedures shall apply:   (i) The Indemnitee
shall promptly give the Stockholder Representative written notice of such
claim; provided, however, that failure to so notify the Stockholder
Representative shall not preclude the Indemnitee from any indemnification
which it may claim, except to the extent that the Stockholder Representative
shall have been actually and materially prejudiced by such failure.   (ii)
The Indemnitee shall permit the Stockholder Representative, at its option and
at its cost and expense, to assume control of the defense of such third-party
claim (and the Stockholder Representative shall have 45 days after the
receipt of notice of such third-party claim to elect to assume such defense
and to so notify Parent and the Indemnitee) utilizing counsel selected by the
Stockholder Representative and not reasonably objected to by Parent;
provided, however, that in the event of any such assumption, the Stockholder
Representative shall acknowledge in writing that any Losses to the Indemnitee
that may result from such third-party claim are indemnifiable Losses pursuant
to this Article X (subject, to the extent applicable, to the Deductible).  
(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee shall have the right to
employ separate counsel in any such claim or proceeding and, to the extent
such third-party claim is indemnifiable pursuant to this Article X (subject,
to the extent applicable, to the Deductible), the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be paid out of the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Deposit held
pursuant to the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, in the event that: (A) the
Stockholder Representative has failed to timely    60    assume the
defense and employ counsel, (B) the Stockholder Representative is
not entitled to assume the defense of a third party claim seeking non-
monetary damages as provided below; or (C) there is a conflict of interest
with respect to any legal defense which may be available and such conflict
would prevent counsel engaged by the Stockholder Representative from claiming
such legal defense; provided, however, to the extent that there is an
indemnifiable Loss, the fees and expenses of more than one firm of separate
counsel in connection with any claim or proceeding shall not be paid out of
the Indemnity Escrow Deposit.   (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Stockholder Representative shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any
third-party claim if:   (A) the third-party claim seeks an
order, injunction or other equitable relief (such third-party claim, a "Non-
Monetary Claim") for other than monetary damages against the Indemnitee that
cannot be separated from any related claim for monetary damages; provided
that (x) the Stockholder Representative shall subject to (B) below be
entitled to assume the defense of any portion of such Non-Monetary Claim that
relates to monetary damages and can be separated from the Non-Monetary Claim,
(y) with respect to such portion of the Non-Monetary Claim that the
Stockholder Representative is not entitled to assume the defense of, the
Stockholder Representative shall have, at its own cost and expense, the right
to have its own counsel participate in an advisory capacity in the defense,
compromise or settlement of such Non-Monetary Claim, and (z) the Indemnitee
acknowledges in writing that the Stockholder Representative has not
acknowledged or otherwise accepted that any Losses to the Indemnitee that may
result from such Non-Monetary Claim being defended by the Indemnitee are
indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this Article X, or   (B) such third-party
claim is an Indemnitee Straddle Claim or an Indemnitee Claim.  For the
purposes of this Section 10.5(b):   "Indemnitee Straddle Claim" means a
third party claim which is or may be subject to indemnification pursuant to
this Article X (such a claim, a "Relevant Claim") and with respect to which,
at the time that the Stockholder Representative would otherwise be entitled
to assume the defense of such Relevant Claim, the Amount Available For
Indemnification is less than 50% of the Amount At Stake.   "Indemnitee
Claim" means a Relevant Claim with respect to which, at the time that the
Stockholder Representative would otherwise be entitled to assume the defense
of such Relevant Claim, the Amount Available For Indemnification is zero.  
"Amount Available For Indemnification" means, with respect to a Relevant
Claim, (A) the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Deposit then held pursuant to
the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and not subject to distribution pursuant to
any Joint Instructions, Accounting Referee Joint Instructions or Dissenting
Shares Joint Instructions previously given pursuant to the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement, less (B) the    61    amount of Losses that may reasonably
be expected to be indemnifiable with respect to all active unresolved claims
for indemnification by Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article X
prior to such Relevant Claim; provided that if the amount in clause (B) of
this definition is greater than the amount in clause (A) of this definition,
then the Amount Available For Indemnification is zero.   "Amount At Stake"
means, with respect to a Relevant Claim, the amount of Losses that may
reasonably be expected to be indemnifiable with respect to such Relevant
Claim.   (c) In the event the Stockholder Representative exercises
its right to undertake control of the defense of any claim by a third party,
the Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Stockholder Representative in such
defense and make available to the Stockholder Representative witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in its possession or under its
control relating thereto as are reasonably requested by the Stockholder
Representative or its counsel. No claim by a third party which is being
defended by the Stockholder Representative may be settled by the Stockholder
Representative, and no entry of any judgment will be consented to by the
Stockholder Representative, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided,
however, that the Stockholder Representative may settle such claim without
the consent of the Indemnitee so long as the settlement (x) includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnitee, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee, from the claim by the third-party claimant
and (y) does not impose any liabilities or obligations on the Indemnitee or
impose any non-monetary penalties. No claim by a third party which is being
defended by the Indemnitee alone, or jointly with the
Stockholder Representative, shall be settled by the Indemnitee, and no entry
of any judgment shall be consented to by the Indemnitee, without the prior
written consent of the Stockholder Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that the Indemnitee may settle such
claim without the consent of the Stockholder Representative so long as the
settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of the Stockholder
Representative, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Stockholder Representative, from the claim by the Indemnitee and the third-
party claimant and (y) does not impose any liabilities or obligations to be
paid from funds held pursuant to the Indemnity Escrow Agreement.   10.6 Tax
Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any indemnity payment made pursuant to this
Article X shall be treated as an adjustment to the Aggregate Merger
Consideration for Tax purposes.   10.7 No Consequential Damages; No
Contribution or Subrogation.   (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, no party shall, in any event, be liable to any
other Person for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive
damages of such other Person, including loss of future revenue, income or
profits, diminution of value or loss of business reputation or opportunity
relating to the breach or alleged breach hereof (provided that such
limitation shall not limit a party\'s right to recover contract damages   
62    in connection with other party\'s breach of this Agreement). For
purposes of this Article X, any damages actually paid by any Indemnitee to a
third party shall be considered direct damages rather than indirect,
consequential, special or punitive damages.   (b) In connection with the
matters covered by this Article X, no holder of Company Common Stock shall
have (i) any right to indemnity or contribution from the Company, or (ii) any
right of subrogation against the Company with respect to any Losses or
indemnification of an Indemnitee by reason of any breach of a covenant,
representation or warranty of the Company hereunder, it being agreed and
acknowledged that the representations, warranties and covenants of the
Company herein are solely for the benefit of Parent and Merger Sub.  
ARTICLE XI - MISCELLANEOUS   11.1 Payment of Sales, Use or Similar Taxes.
Except as set forth in Section 3.2(b) with respect to a transfer of shares of
Company Common Stock not registered in the records of the Company, all sales,
use, transfer, intangible, recordation, documentary stamp or similar Taxes or
charges, of any nature whatsoever, applicable to, or resulting from, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by Parent.  
11.2 Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
are consummated, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of
the Company and Parent shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection
with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other
agreement, document and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.   11.3
Stockholder Representative.   (a) Thomas H. Lee Equity Fund IV, L.P. (the
"Stockholder Representative") has been appointed as the representative of the
stockholders of the Company (i) to act in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, (ii) to contest claims of Parent or any Buyer
Indemnified Party, including any litigation involving this Agreement and
(iii) to do or refrain from doing all such further acts and things, and to
execute all such documents, as such Stockholder Representative shall deem
necessary or appropriate in conjunction with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, the power to take all actions
which under this Agreement may be taken by the Stockholder Representative and
to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed which the Stockholder
Representative deems necessary or appropriate in his sole discretion relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement.   (b) The Stockholder
Representative will not be liable for any act taken or omitted by it as
permitted under this Agreement, except if such act is taken or omitted in bad
faith or by willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative will also be
fully protected in relying upon any written notice, demand, certificate or
document that it in good faith believes to be genuine (including facsimiles
thereof).    63     (c) The Stockholder Representative may, at its own
cost and expense, consult with counsel of its own choice and will have full
and complete authorization and protection for any action taken and suffered
by it in good faith and in accordance with the opinion of such counsel.  
(d) Subject to Section 11.3(e), the provisions of this Section 11.3 shall in
no way impose any obligations on Parent. In particular, notwithstanding any
notice received by the Parent to the contrary, the Parent shall be fully
protected in relying upon and shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall have
no liability to the stockholders of the Company with respect to actions,
decisions or determinations of the Stockholder Representative. Parent shall
be entitled to assume that all actions, decisions and determinations of the

acknowledge that the Stockholder Representative can act as provided in this
Agreement and any such provisions are for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the Stockholder Representative.   11.4 Submission to
Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.   (a) The parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state
court located within the State of New York over any dispute arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and
each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such
dispute or any suit, action proceeding related thereto may be heard and
determined in such courts. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which they may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such

This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedules and exhibits hereto), the
Company Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement represent the entire
understanding and agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement can be amended, supplemented or
changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument
making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom
enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is
sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party
hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be
construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver
of    64    any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of
any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy.   11.6 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts made and performed in such State.   11.7 Notices. All notices and

Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all
other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.  
11.9 Binding Effect; Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall
create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in
any person or entity not a party to this Agreement except as contemplated
by Sections 8.7, 8.14 and 11.3. No assignment of this Agreement or of any
rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any party, directly or
indirectly (by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto and any attempted assignment without the
required consents shall be void; provided, however, Parent may (i) assign any
or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its wholly-
owned Subsidiaries and (ii) designate one or more of its wholly-owned
Subsidiaries to perform its obligations hereunder; provided, further,
however, that in any such case, Parent shall remain responsible for the
performance of all of its obligations hereunder. No assignment of any
obligations hereunder shall relieve the parties hereto of any such
obligations.   11.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of
this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to
constitute one and the same agreement.    66     11.11 Waiver of Jury
Trial. Each party hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
Legal Proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in
connection with this Agreement, any Company Documents or any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby. Each party hereto (i) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (ii)
acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement and the Company Documents, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 11.11.  
11.12 Performance. Parent and Merger Sub (the "Buying Parties") acknowledge
and agree that the breach of this Agreement by any of the Buying Parties
would cause irreparable damage to the Company and that the Company will not
have an adequate remedy at Law, and the Company acknowledges and agrees
that the breach of this Agreement by the Company would cause irreparable
damage to the Buying Parties and that the Buying Parties will not have an
adequate remedy at Law. Therefore, the obligations of the parties hereto
under this Agreement shall be enforceable by a decree of specific performance
issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive
relief may be applied for and granted in connection therewith. Such remedies
shall, however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to
any other remedies which any party may have under this Agreement or
otherwise.  ** REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK **

Agreement   Exhibit A to the  Merger Agreement   SUPPORT AGREEMENT  
SUPPORT AGREEMENT, dated as of October 6, 2004 (this "Agreement"), by and
among Encoda Systems Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
Harris Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and the Persons listed
on Exhibit A hereto (the "Major Stockholders").    WITNESSETH:   WHEREAS,
concurrently herewith, the Company, Parent and Sunshine Merger Corp., a
Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub") are entering into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (as such agreement may hereafter be amended from time to time, the
"Merger Agreement"; capitalized terms used and not defined herein have the
respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement), pursuant to
which Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company
continuing as the Surviving Corporation (the "Merger") and pursuant to which
the Shares (as defined below) shall be converted into the right to
receive the merger consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement at the
Effective Time;   WHEREAS, each of the Major Stockholders owns of record
the number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
"Shares") of the Company set forth opposite such Major Stockholder\'s name on
Exhibit A hereto; and   WHEREAS, as a condition to their willingness to
enter into the Merger Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have
requested that the Major Stockholders, and the Major Stockholders have
agreed, to enter into this Agreement strictly in their capacity as record
owners of the Shares and not in any other capacity (including, if applicable,
as a director or officer of the Company).   NOW, THEREFORE, to induce the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub to enter into, and in consideration of their
entering into, the Merger Agreement, and in consideration of the premises and
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:   1. Provisions Concerning the Shares.   (a) Each Major
Stockholder hereby agrees that during the period commencing on the date
hereof and continuing until this provision terminates pursuant to Section 8
hereof, at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company, however called, or
in connection with any written consent of the stockholders of the Company,
such Major Stockholder shall vote (or cause to be voted) the Shares owned and
held of record by such Major Stockholder, whether heretofore owned
or hereafter acquired, or execute and deliver a consent, (i) in favor of
approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
(including the Merger and any other matter that is on the ballot
or       in a written consent related thereto) and any actions required
in furtherance thereof; (ii) against any action or agreement that (A) would
result in a breach in any respect of any covenant, representation or warranty
or any other obligation or agreement of the Company under the Merger
Agreement or any agreement executed in connection therewith (without giving
effect to any materiality or similar qualifications contained therein) or (B)
which is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions in Section 9.1
of the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled; and (iii) against any "Other
Bid" (as defined below) or any other action which is intended, or could
reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, or
adversely affect the Merger. In the event that any corporate action
consistent with this Agreement is taken by the stockholders of the Company by
written consent (including any action to approve the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby), each Major Stockholder hereby waives any
right to receive notice of the taking of such corporate action without a
meeting pursuant to Section 228(e) of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL") or otherwise.   (b) In the event of a stock
dividend or distribution, or any change in the capital stock of the Company
by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares, merger or the like, the
term "Shares" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to and
include the Shares as well as all such stock dividends and distributions and
any shares or other securities into which or for which any or all of the
Shares may be converted, changed or exchanged.   2. Waiver of Claims. Each
Major Stockholder hereby acknowledges that the consideration payable under
the Merger Agreement constitutes the consideration to which such Major
Stockholder is entitled for such Major Stockholder\'s Shares pursuant to the
Merger and represents fair value for such Major Stockholder\'s Shares and
that such Major Stockholder irrevocably waives any rights to appraisal of the
fair value of such Major Stockholder\'s Shares or rights to dissent from the
Merger that such Major Stockholder may have pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL or otherwise.   3. Representations and Warranties. Each Major
Stockholder hereby, severally and not jointly, represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:   (a) Ownership of Shares. Such Major
Stockholder (together with its trustees if it is a trust) is the record owner
of the number of Shares set forth opposite such Major Stockholder\'s name on
Exhibit A hereto. The Shares set forth opposite such Major Stockholder\'s
name on Exhibit A hereto constitute all of the Shares owned of record by such
Major Stockholder (together with its trustees if it is a trust). If such
Major Stockholder is married and the Shares of such Major Stockholder
constitute community property or otherwise are owned or held in a manner that
requires spousal or other approval for this Agreement to be legal, valid and
binding, this Agreement has been duly consented to by such Major
Stockholder\'s spouse or the applicable Person giving such approval.    
2    (b) Power; Binding Agreement. Such Major Stockholder (together with
its trustees if it is a trust) has the legal capacity, power and authority to
enter into and perform all of such Major Stockholder\'s obligations under
this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed
and delivered by such Major Stockholder and constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of such Major Stockholder, enforceable against such Major
Stockholder in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar
Laws affecting creditors\' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to
enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of
commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at Law or in equity).   (c) No
Conflicts. None of the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by such Major Stockholder or compliance by such Major Stockholder with any of
the provisions hereof will (i) require such Major Stockholder to make a
filing with, or obtain any Permit, (ii) result in a violation or breach of,
or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default, or
give to any Person any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation or result in the creation of any Lien on any Shares of such
Major Stockholder, under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
declaration of trust or Contract to which such Major Shareholder is a
party, or (iii) violate any Order or Law applicable to such Major
Stockholder, except with respect to items (ii) and (iii) above, for breaches,
defaults or violations that would not materially impair or delay such Major
Stockholder\'s ability to perform his or its obligations hereunder.   (d)
No Encumbrances. Except as applicable in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, such Major Stockholder\'s Shares and
the certificates representing such Shares are now, and will be, at all times
during the term hereof, owned and held of record by such Major Stockholder,
free and clear of all Liens, proxies, voting trusts or
Contracts, understandings or arrangements, except for any such Liens or
proxies arising hereunder in favor of Parent. Each Major Stockholder has the
sole power to vote (or cause to be voted) all of the Shares owned of record
by such Major Stockholder.   (e) No Cause of Action. Such Major
Stockholder, by delivering its Certificates and letter of transmittal
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, shall be deemed to be representing
hereunder that such Major Stockholder does not, as of the Effective Time and
after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
have a claim, action, cause of action or demand of any kind or character,
based upon any fact or circumstance, which presently exists, or may exist in
the future, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   (f) Reliance
by the Parent and Merger Sub. Such Major Stockholder understands and
acknowledges that the Parent and Merger Sub are entering into the Merger
Agreement in reliance upon execution and delivery of this Agreement by such
Major Stockholder.      3    (g) Merger Agreement. Such Major
Stockholder acknowledges receipt of the Merger Agreement (including the
exhibits and schedules thereto). Such Major Stockholder has had an
opportunity to read and understand the Merger Agreement and the related
exhibits and schedules thereto.   4. No Solicitation. Each Major Stockholder
agrees on a several, not joint and several basis, that such Major Stockholder
shall not, nor shall any of them authorize or permit any officer, director or
employee of or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by any of them to, (i) directly or indirectly
solicit, initiate or encourage any Other Bid, (ii) enter into any agreement
with respect to any Other Bid or (iii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect
to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Other Bid. Each Major Stockholder shall promptly advise Parent orally and in
writing of any Other Bid or any inquiry with respect to or which could lead
to any Other Bid and the identity of the Person making any such Other Bid or
inquiry. As used in this Section 4, "Other Bid" shall mean any proposal for a
merger, sale of a majority of the Company\'s equity securities, sale of
substantial assets or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement. Each Major Stockholder shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations by such Major
Stockholder or any officer, director or employee of or any investment banker,
attorney, accountant or other representative retained by such
Major Stockholder, with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Other Bid.   5. Restriction on Transfer; Stop Transfer. Each Major
Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, during the period commencing
on the date hereof and continuing until this provision terminates pursuant to
Section 8 hereof: (i) except for any deemed sale of Shares as a result of the
Merger, offer for sale, sell, transfer, tender, pledge, encumber, assign or
otherwise dispose of, or grant or enter into any contract, option or other
arrangement or understanding with respect to or consent to the offer for
sale, sale, transfer, tender, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or other
disposition of, any or all of such Major Stockholder\'s Shares or any
interest therein; (ii) except as contemplated by this Agreement, grant any
proxies or powers of attorney, deposit any Shares into a voting trust or
enter into a voting agreement with respect to any Shares; or (iii) take any
action that would make any of such Major Stockholder\'s representations or
warranties contained herein untrue or incorrect or have the effect of
preventing or disabling such Major Stockholder from performing such Major
Stockholder\'s obligations under this Agreement or that would prevent or
disable the Parent from exercising the proxy granted pursuant to Section 6
hereof.   6. Grant of Irrevocable Proxy Coupled with an Interest.   (a)
Solely in the event of a failure by a Major Stockholder to act in accordance
with its obligations as to voting or executing a written consent pursuant to
Section 1(a) of this Agreement, such Major Stockholder hereby revokes any and
all prior proxies or powers of attorney in respect of any Shares and agrees
that during the period     4   commencing on the date hereof and
continuing until this provision terminates pursuant to Section 8 hereof, such
Major Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints Parent or any individual
designated by Parent as such Major Stockholder\'s agent, attorney-in-fact and
proxy (with full power of substitution), for in the name, place and stead of
such Major Stockholder, to vote (or cause to be voted) the Shares held of
record by such Major Stockholder, in the manner set forth in Section 1
hereof, at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company or in connection
with any written consent of the stockholders of the Company.   (b) Each
Major Stockholder hereby affirms that the proxy set forth in this Section 6
is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable until such time as this
Agreement terminates in accordance with its terms. Such irrevocable proxy is
executed and intended to be irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of
Section 212 of the DGCL.   (c) The vote of the proxyholder shall control in
any conflict between the vote by the proxyholder of such Major Stockholder\'s
Shares and a vote by such Major Stockholder of such Major Stockholder\'s
Shares.   7. Stockholder Representative. Each Major Stockholder
hereby ratifies and confirms all that the Stockholder Representative shall do
or cause to be done by virtue of such Stockholder Representative\'s
appointment as Stockholder Representative of such shareholder pursuant to the
Merger Agreement. The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to act
with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Merger Agreement, the
Escrow Agreements and any other agreements entered into in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and with respect to all
matters contemplated by all such agreements, in the manner the Stockholder
Representative believes to be in the best interest of the shareholders of the
Company prior to the Effective Time, but the Stockholder Representative shall
not be responsible for any loss or damage any shareholder may suffer by
reason of the performance by the Stockholder Representative of such
Stockholder Representative\'s duties, other than loss or damage arising from
willful misconduct or bad faith in the performance of such Stockholder
Representative\'s duties. The Major Stockholders do hereby jointly and
severally agree to indemnify and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless
from and against any and all liability, loss, cost, damage or expense
(including without limitation attorneys\' fees) reasonably incurred or
suffered as a result of the performance of such Stockholder Representative\'s
duties except for willful misconduct or bad faith. No suit, action,
proceeding or claim may be brought by any Major Stockholder against Parent,
the Company, or any of their respective directors, officers and employees
with respect to any matter herein, in the Merger Agreement, the
Escrow Agreements or any other agreement entered into by the Stockholder
Representative in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement that is to be effected by the Stockholder Representative.   8.
Termination. The covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, other
than Section 3 which shall survive for a period of one year following the
Effective Time, Section 7 and Sections 9(a), (c), (d), (e), (f), (h)-(n),
(q)-(u) which shall survive indefinitely, shall terminate upon
(i) termination of the Merger Agreement,      5   or (ii) in the
event the Merger is consummated, upon the Effective Time; provided, that no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for any
willful breach of this Agreement; and provided, further, that the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3 hereof shall
not terminate with respect to any item as to which Parent may have made a
claim by delivering a notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the
basis of such claim) before the expiration of one year following the
Effective Time to the applicable Major Stockholder in accordance with this
Agreement.   9. Miscellaneous.   (a) Entire Agreement. This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof.   (b) Certain Events. Each Major Stockholder
agrees that this Agreement and the obligations hereunder shall attach to the
Shares and shall be binding upon any Person to which legal ownership of such
Shares shall pass, whether by operation of Law or otherwise, including,
without limitation, such Major Stockholder\'s heirs, executors, guardians,
administrators, trustees or successors. Notwithstanding any transfer of
Shares, the transferor shall remain liable for the performance of all
obligations of the transferor under this Agreement.   (c) Assignment. This
Agreement shall not be assigned by any party hereto, by operation of Law or
otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any
purported assignment without such consent shall be null and void. All
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement by or on behalf of the
parties hereto shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the respective
successors, heirs and permitted assigns of the parties hereto.   (d)
Amendments, Waivers, Etc. This Agreement may not be amended, changed,
supplemented, waived or otherwise modified or (except as set forth in Section
8) terminated except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement
executed by each of the parties hereto.   (e) Notices. All notices and other
communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed
given (i) when delivered personally by hand (with written confirmation of
receipt), (ii) when sent by facsimile (with written confirmation of
transmission) or (iii) one Business Day following the day sent by overnight
courier (with written confirmation of receipt). All communications hereunder
shall be delivered to the respective parties at the following addresses: (i)
if to the Company or Parent, to its respective address set forth in the
Merger Agreement; and (ii) if to any Major Stockholder, to such Major
Stockholder\'s address set forth on Exhibit A hereto; or, in each case, to
such other address as the Person to whom notice is given may have previously
furnished to the other parties hereto in writing in the manner set forth
above.    6    (f) Severability. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.   (g) Specific
Performance. Each Major Stockholder recognizes and acknowledges that a breach
by it of any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement will cause
Parent to sustain irreparable damages for which it would not have an adequate
remedy at Law for money damages, and therefore such Major Stockholder agrees
that in the event of any such breach Parent shall be entitled to the remedy
of specific performance of such covenants and agreements and injunctive and
other equitable relief in addition to any other remedy to which Parent may be
entitled at Law or in equity.   (h) Remedies Cumulative. All rights, powers
and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect
hereof at Law or in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the
exercise of any thereof by any party shall not preclude the simultaneous or
later exercise of any other such right, power or remedy by such party.  
(i) No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is not intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall not be enforceable by, any Person who or which is
not a party hereto.   (j) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of Law thereof.   (k)
Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any Legal Proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of, under
or in connection with this Agreement, any Company Documents or
any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby.   (l) Submission to
Jurisdiction. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court located within the State
of New York over any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereby irrevocably
agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action
proceeding related thereto may be heard and determined in such courts. The
parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of
inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law.     7     (m) Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings
used herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not
intended to be part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.   (n) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which, taken together, shall constitute one and the same Agreement. Delivery
of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.   (o) Further Assurances. From time to time, as and when
reasonably requested by Parent, each Major Stockholder shall execute and
deliver all such documents and instruments, and shall take all such further
or other actions, as shall be necessary or appropriate to carry out the
intent of this Agreement.   (p) Publicity. From the date hereof until the
date upon which this Agreement terminates in accordance with the provisions
hereof, no Major Stockholder shall issue any press release or public
announcement concerning this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of Parent,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless, in the judgment of
such Major Stockholder, disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or
by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which such Major Stockholder
lists securities, provided that, to the extent required by applicable Law,
any Major Stockholder intending to make such release shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts consistent with applicable Law to consult
with Parent with respect to the text thereof.   (q) Confidentiality. Each
Major Stockholder shall keep confidential, shall not use in a manner in
competition with or detrimental to the Company, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and instruct each of its directors, officers, employees and
advisors to keep confidential, all confidential or proprietary information
relating to the Company, the Company\'s Subsidiaries and their respective
businesses, except as required by applicable Law and except for information
which is available to the public on the date hereof, or thereafter becomes
available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this provision
or any other confidentiality agreement governing such information.   (r)
Expenses. Except as set forth in the Merger Agreement, all fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees, costs and
expenses.   (s) Reliance on Counsel and Other Advisors. Each of the
parties hereto has consulted with such legal, financial, technical or other
experts as it deems necessary or desirable before entering into this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto represents and warrants that it has
read, knows, understands and agrees with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.   (t) Waiver. No failure or delay on the part of any party
hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be
construed to be a waiver of,    8    or acquiescence in, any breach of
any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor will any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or future exercise
thereof or of any other right.   (u) Several Nature of Obligations.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, each
obligation of a Major Stockholder under this Agreement shall be the several,
and not joint, obligation of such Major Stockholder only, and each Major
Stockholder shall be responsible for, and shall only be responsible for, such
Major Stockholder\'s actions and not the actions or omissions of any other
Major Stockholder.   (v) Termination of Shareholders Agreements. By their
