AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement") is made and entered
into as of October 26, 2000, among Microchip Technology Incorporated, a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Matchbox Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"),
and Telcom Semiconductor, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company").  
RECITALS   A. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement
and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"),
Parent, Merger Sub and Company intend to enter into a business combination
transaction.   B. The Board of Directors of Company (i) has determined that
the Merger (as defined in Section 1.01) is consistent with and in furtherance
of the long-term business strategy of Company and fair to, and in the best
interests of, Company and its stockholders, (ii) has approved this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii)
has adopted a resolution declaring the Merger advisable and (iv) has
determined unanimously to recommend that the stockholders of Company adopt

that the Merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term
business strategy of Parent and fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent
and its stockholders, (ii) has approved this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) has adopted a
resolution declaring the Merger advisable.   D. Concurrently with the

as Exhibit A (the "Company Voting Agreements"), (2) Company is executing and

Agreement, to adopt a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the

and representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   Section 1.01 The
Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.02) and subject to and
upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions
of Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Company (the
"Merger"), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation. Company as the surviving
corporation after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation."   Section 1.02 Effective Time; Closing. As soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date (as defined in this Section 1.2),
and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the
parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the applicable provisions
of Delaware Law (the time of such filing (or such later time as may be agreed
upon in writing by Parent and Company and specified in the Certificate of
Merger) being referred to herein as the "Effective Time"). The closing of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall
take place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional
Corporation, located at One Market, Spear Tower, Suite 3300, San Francisco,
California 94105, at a date and time to be specified by Parent and Company,
which shall be no later than the second business day following
the satisfaction or, if permitted pursuant hereto, waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article VI hereof, or at such other location, date and time as
Parent and Company shall mutually agree in writing. The date upon which the
Closing actually occurs shall be referred to herein as the "Closing
Date."   Section 1.03 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the
effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.    -2-     Section 1.04 Certificate of
Incorporation; Bylaws.   (a) At the Effective Time, subject to the
provisions of Section 5.10,  the Certificate of Incorporation of Company
shall be amended and restated  to be identical to the Certificate of
Incorporation in effect for Merger  Sub at the Effective Time.   (b)
Subject to the provisions of Section 5.10, the Bylaws of Company  shall be
amended and restated to be those in effect for Merger Sub at the  Effective
Time.   Section 1.05 Directors and Officers. The initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time until their successors shall have been duly elected
and qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be
the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time until
their successors shall have been duly elected and qualified.   Section 1.06
Effect on Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any
of the following securities, the following shall occur:   (a) Conversion of
Company Common Stock. Each share of common stock,  par value $0.001 per
share, of Company (the "Company Common Stock") issued  and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any  share of Company
Common Stock to be canceled and extinguished pursuant to  Section 1.06(b))
will be automatically converted (subject to Sections  1.06(e) and (f)) into a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (as  defined below) (the "Exchange
Ratio") equal to (x) $15.00 divided by (y)  the average closing sale price of
one share of common stock of Parent, par  value $0.001 per share ("Parent
Common Stock"), on the Nasdaq National  Market during the ten (10) trading
days ending on the trading day  immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"ACP"); provided, that if the  ACP is greater than $32.61, the Exchange Ratio
shall be .46, and provided,  further that if the ACP is less than $28.30, the
Exchange Ratio shall be  .53. If any shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to  the Effective Time are unvested or are
subject to a repurchase option, risk  of forfeiture or other condition under
any applicable restricted stock  purchase agreement or other agreement with
Company, then, except to the  extent otherwise provided in such agreement,
the shares of Parent Common  Stock issued in exchange for such shares of
Company Common Stock will also  be unvested and subject to the same
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture  or other condition, and the
certificates representing such shares of Parent  Common Stock may accordingly
be marked with appropriate legends.   (b) Cancellation of Company-Owned
Stock. Each share of Company Common  Stock held by Company or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of  Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and  extinguished without any conversion
thereof.   (c) Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plans. At the
Effective  Time, all options to purchase Company Common Stock then
outstanding under  Company\'s 1994 Stock Option Plan, the Company\'s 1996
Director Stock Option  Plan and the Company\'s 2000 Non-Statutory Stock
Option Plan (the "Company   -3-     Option Plans"), and the Company
Option Plans themselves, shall, except as  otherwise set forth herein, be
assumed by Parent in accordance with Section  5.08. At the Effective Time,
all purchase rights then outstanding under  Company\'s 1995 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), and the ESPP  itself, shall be assumed by Parent
in accordance with Section 5.08.   (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each
share of Common Stock, $0.001  par value per share, of Merger Sub (the
"Merger Sub Common Stock") issued  and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted  into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of Common  Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation. Each  certificate evidencing ownership of shares of
Merger Sub Common Stock shall  evidence ownership of such shares of capital
stock of the Surviving  Corporation.   (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio.
The Exchange Ratio shall be  adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of
any stock split, reverse  stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of  securities convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for Parent  Common Stock or Company Common Stock), extraordinary
cash dividend,  reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange  of shares or other like change with respect to Parent
Common Stock or  Company Common Stock occurring or having a record date on or
after the date  hereof and prior to the Effective Time.   (f) Fractional
Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock  will be issued by
virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of  shares of Company
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a  fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all  fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received  by such holder) shall,
upon surrender of such holder\'s Certificates(s) (as  defined in Section
1.07(c)), receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded  to the nearest
whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of (i)  such fraction,
multiplied by (ii) the average closing price of one share of  Parent Common
Stock for the five (5) most recent days that Parent Common  Stock has traded
ending on the trading day immediately prior to the  Effective Time, as
reported on the Nasdaq National Market ("Nasdaq").   Section 1.07 Surrender
of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall select a  bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Company to act
as the  exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.   (b) Parent
to Provide Common Stock. Promptly after the Effective Time,  Parent shall
make available to the Exchange Agent, for exchange in  accordance with this
Article I, the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable  pursuant to Section
1.06(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company  Common Stock, and cash
in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of  fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.06(f) and any dividends or  distributions to which holders of
shares of Company Common Stock may be  entitled pursuant to Section
1.07(d).   -4-     (c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent  shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
(as of the  Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates, which
immediately prior  to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common  Stock (the "Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form  (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and  title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the  Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in 
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates 
representing shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.06(a),  cash
in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.06(f) and any 
dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.07(d). Upon  surrender
of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such  other
agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such  letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance  with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be  entitled to
receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the  number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock into which their shares of  Company Common
Stock were converted pursuant to Section 1.06(a), payment in  lieu of
fractional shares which such holders have the right to receive  pursuant to
Section 1.06(f) and any dividends or other distributions  payable pursuant to
Section 1.07(d), and the Certificates so surrendered  shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates  will be deemed,
from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the  ownership of the
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which  such shares of
Company Common Stock shall have been so converted (including  any voting,
notice or other rights associated with the ownership of such  shares of
Parent Common Stock under the Certificate of Incorporation or  Bylaws of
Parent or under Delaware Law) and the right to receive an amount  in cash in
lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with  Section
1.06(f) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant  to Section
1.07(d).   (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Dividends
or  other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement
with  respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time  will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with
respect  to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby when the
holders  of record of such Certificates surrender such Certificates.   (e)
Transfers of Ownership. If certificates representing shares of  Parent Common
Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the  Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a  condition of
the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will  be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the  persons
requesting such exchange will have (i) paid to Parent or any agent 
designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the 
issuance of certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any 
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates 
surrendered, or (ii) established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent 
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (f)
Required Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the  Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any  consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement  to any holder or
former holder of Company Common Stock or Company Stock    -5-    
Options such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld  therefrom
under the Code or state, local or foreign law. To the extent such  amounts
are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all  purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom  such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.   (g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this  Section 1.07, neither the Exchange Agent, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation  nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder
of shares of Parent Common  Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount
properly paid to a public  official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar  law.   Section 1.08 No Further Ownership
Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof
pursuant to Sections 1.06(f) and 1.07(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock. There shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
I.   Section 1.09 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that
any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates
were converted pursuant to Section 1.06(a), cash for fractional shares, if
any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.06(f) and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.07(d); provided, however, that
the Exchange Agent, may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance of such certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock
and the payment of cash and other distributions, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it
may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   Section 1.10
Tax and Accounting Consequences.   (a) It is intended by the parties hereto
that the Merger shall  constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the  Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization"  within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and
1.368-3(a) of the United  States Treasury Regulations.   (b) It is intended
by the parties hereto that the Merger shall qualify  as a "pooling of
interests" for accounting purposes.    -6-     Section 1.11 Taking of
Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized (in the name
of Merger Sub, Company, the Surviving Corporation and otherwise) to take all
such necessary action.   ARTICLE II  REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY   Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, subject
to such exceptions as are disclosed in writing in the disclosure letter
supplied by Company to Parent dated as of the date hereof (the "Company
Schedule"), which disclosure shall provide an exception to or otherwise
qualify the representations or warranties of Company contained in the section
of this Agreement corresponding by number to such disclosure and the
other representations and warranties herein to the extent such disclosure
shall reasonably appear to be applicable to such other representations or
warranties, as follows:   Section 2.01 Organization and Qualification;
Subsidiaries.   (a) Each of Company and its subsidiaries is a corporation
duly  organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the  jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power
and  authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to
carry  on its business as it is now being conducted.   (b) Section 2.01(b)
of the Company Schedule sets forth (i) each  subsidiary of Company, (ii) the
ownership interest therein of Company and  (iii) if not wholly-owned by
Company, the identity and ownership interest  of each other owner of such
subsidiary. Neither Company nor any of its  subsidiaries has agreed to make
nor is obligated to make nor is bound by  any written or oral agreement,
contract, understanding, negotiable  instrument, commitment or undertaking of
any nature, in effect as of the  date hereof or as may hereafter be in effect
(a "Contract"), under which it  may become obligated to make, any future
investment in or capital  contribution to any other entity. Neither Company
nor any of its  subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any equity or
similar interest in  or any interest convertible, exchangeable or exercisable
for, any equity or  similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint
venture or other  business, association or entity other than the entities
identified in  Section 2.01(b) of the Company Schedule.   (c) Company and
each of its subsidiaries is qualified or licensed to  do business as a
foreign corporation, and is in good standing (with respect  to jurisdictions
which recognize such concept), under the laws of all  jurisdictions where the
character of the properties owned, leased or   -7-     operated by them
or the nature of their activities requires such  qualification or licensing,
except where the failure to be so qualified  could not reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect on  Company.   Section 2.02
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Company has previously furnished to
Parent a complete and correct copy of its Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws as amended and in effect as of the date of this Agreement (together,
the "Company Charter Documents"). Such Company Charter Documents and

material liability. No charge, complaint, claim, demand, notice,  inquiry,
investigation, action, suit, proceeding, hearing or review by any

threatened against Company or its subsidiaries, nor, to Company\'s 
knowledge, has any Governmental Entity indicated to Company in writing an 
intention to conduct the same, other than, in each such case, those the 
outcome of which could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be 
expected to have the effect of prohibiting or materially restricting any 
business practice of Company or any of its subsidiaries, any acquisition of 
material property by Company or any of its subsidiaries or the conduct of 
business by Company or any of its subsidiaries.   (b) Company and its
subsidiaries hold all franchises, grants,  authorizations, permits, licenses,

rules and regulations  thereunder, the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, and
the filing and  recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required by
Delaware Law and  (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations  or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, (A)
would not prevent  consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent Parent or
Merger Sub from  performing their respective obligations under this Agreement
or (B) could  not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a  Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   Section 3.06 Legal
Compliance.   Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in conflict with, or in
default or violation of, any Legal Requirement, except for any conflicts,
defaults or violations that (individually or in the aggregate) would not
cause Parent or Merger Sub to incur any material liability. No charge,
complaint, claim, demand, notice, inquiry, investigation, action, suit,
proceeding, hearing or review by any Governmental Entity is pending or, to
the knowledge of Parent, being threatened against Parent or Merger Sub, nor,
to Parent\'s knowledge, has any Governmental Entity indicated to Parent in
writing an intention to conduct the same, other than, in each such case,
those the outcome of which could not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or materially
restricting any business practice of Parent or Merger Sub, any acquisition of
material property by the Parent or Merger Sub or the conduct of business by
Parent or any of its subsidiaries.   Section 3.07 SEC Filings; Financial
Statements.   (a) Parent has made available to Company (through reference

SEC  Reports"), which are all the forms, reports and documents required to
be  filed by Parent with the SEC since such date. As of their respective
dates,  the Parent SEC Reports (A) were prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, 
and (B) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by 
a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such 
filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a 
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make 
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were 
made, not misleading. None of Parent\'s subsidiaries is required to file any 
reports or other documents with the SEC.   (b) Each set of consolidated
financial statements (including, in each  case, any related notes thereto)
contained in the Parent SEC Reports was  prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout  the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto and   -28-      except that unaudited
statements do not contain footnotes in substance or  form required by GAAP,
as is permitted by Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act)  and each fairly presents
in all material respects the consolidated  financial position of Parent and
its subsidiaries at the respective dates  thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for  the periods indicated, except
that the unaudited interim financial  statements were or are subject to
normal year-end adjustments.   (c) Parent has previously furnished to
Company a complete and correct  copy of any amendments or modifications,
which have not yet been filed with  the SEC but which are required to be
filed, to agreements, documents or  other instruments which previously had
been filed by Parent with the SEC  pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act.   Section 3.08 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither Parent nor
any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) of a nature required to be disclosed on a balance sheet or in the
related notes to the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance
with GAAP which are, individually or in the aggregate, material to the
business, results of operations or financial condition of Parent and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, except (i) liabilities disclosed or provided
for in Parent\'s unaudited balance sheet as of June 30, 2000 as set forth in
the Parent SEC Reports or in the related notes or (ii) liabilities incurred
since June 30, 2000 in the ordinary course of business.   Section 3.09
Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since June 30, 2000, there has not
been: (i) any Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (ii) any declaration,
setting aside or payment of any dividend on, or other distribution (whether
in cash, stock or property) in respect of, any of Parent\'s or any of its
subsidiaries\' capital stock, or any purchase, redemption or
other acquisition by Parent of any of Parent\'s capital stock or any other
securities of Parent or its subsidiaries or any options, warrants, calls or
rights to acquire any such shares or other securities except for repurchases
from employees following their termination pursuant to the terms of
their pre-existing stock option or purchase agreements, (iii) any split,
combination or reclassification of any of Parent\'s or any of its
subsidiaries\' capital stock, (iv) any material change by Parent in its
accounting methods, principles or practices, except as required by concurrent
changes in GAAP, (v) any amendment or consent with respect to any licensing
agreement filed or required to be filed by Parent with the SEC, or (vi) any
material revaluation by Parent of any of its assets, including, without
limitation, writing down the value of capitalized inventory or writing off
notes or accounts receivable or any sale of assets of the Parent other than
in the ordinary course of business.   Section 3.10 Absence of Litigation. As
of the date hereof, there are no claims, suits, actions or proceedings that
have a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened against, relating to or affecting Parent or
any of its subsidiaries, before any court, governmental department,
commission, agency, instrumentality or authority, or any arbitrator that seek
to restrain or enjoin the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or that could otherwise reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   -29-     Section 3.11 Registration
Statement; Proxy Statement. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent for inclusion in: (i) the S-4 will, at the time the S-4
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; and (ii) the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will, at the date mailed to the stockholders of Company,
at the time of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting and at the Effective Time,
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The S-4
will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC
thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no representation or
warranty with respect to any information supplied by Company which is
contained in any of the foregoing documents.   Section 3.12 Taxes.   (a)

local and foreign returns, estimates, forms, information statements  and

each of its subsidiaries with any Tax authority, except such Returns  which
are not, individually or in the aggregate, material to Parent. Parent  and
each of its subsidiaries have paid all Taxes required to be paid  whether or
not shown to be due on such Returns.   (b) Neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries has any liability for  any material unpaid Taxes (whether or not
shown to be done on any Return)  which has not been accrued for or reserved
on Parent\'s balance sheet dated  June 30, 2000 in accordance with GAAP,
whether asserted or unasserted,  contingent or otherwise, which is material
to Parent, other than any  liability for unpaid Taxes that may have accrued
since April 1, 2000 in  connection with the operation of the business of
Parent and its  subsidiaries in the ordinary course. There are no liens with
respect to  Taxes on any of the assets of Parent or any of its subsidiaries,
other than  liens which are not individually or in the aggregate material, or
customary  liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable.   (c) Neither
Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has been delinquent in  the payment of any
material Tax. There is no material Tax deficiency  outstanding, proposed or
assessed against Parent or any of its  subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor any
of its subsidiaries has executed any  unexpired waiver of any statute of
limitations on or extension of any  period for the assessment or collection
of any Tax.   (d) Parent and each of its subsidiaries are in full compliance
with  all terms and conditions of any Tax exemptions, Tax holiday or other
Tax  reduction agreement or order of a territorial or foreign government and
the  consummation of the Merger will not have any adverse effect on the 
continued validity and effectiveness of any such Tax exemptions, Tax  holiday
or other Tax reduction agreement or order.   -30-     Section 3.13

pursuant to an engagement letter dated September 18, 2000, a copy of which

or agent\'s commissions or any similar charges in connection with this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby.   Section 3.14

Intellectual Property" shall mean any Intellectual Property that is owned by,
or exclusively licensed to, Parent and its subsidiaries.   (a) No Parent
Intellectual Property is subject to any proceeding or  outstanding decree,
order, judgment, contract, license, agreement, or  stipulation restricting in
any manner by its terms the use, transfer, or  licensing thereof by Parent or
any of its subsidiaries, or which may affect  the validity, use or
enforceability of such Parent Intellectual Property,  in each case which

distribution, reproduction, marketing or sale of the products of Parent and 
its subsidiaries has not infringed or misappropriated and does not infringe 
or misappropriate the Intellectual Property of any third party, and does  not

practices under  the laws of any jurisdiction, except as would not be
expected to have a  Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.15 Opinion of

contained in Section 203 of the Delaware Law applicable to a "business

that the Board of Directors of Company has recommended that Company\'s 
stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve this Agreement and the 
Merger at the Company Stockholders\' Meeting; and (iii) neither the Board of 
Directors of Company nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or 
modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner 
adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Company 
that Company\'s stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve this 
Agreement and the Merger.   (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the
Board of Directors of  Company from withholding, withdrawing, amending or
modifying its  recommendation in favor of the Merger if (i) a Superior Offer
(as defined  below) is made to Company and not withdrawn, (ii) neither
Company nor any  of its representatives shall have violated any of the
restrictions set  forth in Section 5.04, and (iii) the Board of Directors of
Company  concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel, that,  in light of such Superior Offer, the withholding, withdrawal,
amendment or  modification of such recommendation is required in order for
the Board of  Directors of Company to comply with its fiduciary obligations
to Company\'s  stockholders under applicable law. Nothing contained in this
Section 5.02  shall limit Company\'s obligation to hold and convene the
Company  Stockholders\' Meeting (regardless of whether the recommendation of
the  Board of Directors of Company shall have been withdrawn, amended or 
modified). For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Offer" shall mean an 
unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a third party to consummate  any
of the following transactions: (i) a merger, consolidation, business 
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar 
transaction involving Company pursuant to which the stockholders of Company 
immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 51% of the equity 
interest in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction; (ii) a 
sale or other disposition by Company of assets (excluding inventory and  used
equipment sold in the ordinary course of business) representing in  excess of
51% of the fair market value of Company\'s business immediately   
-38-     prior to such sale, or (iii) the acquisition by any person or
group  (including by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance
by  Company), directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to 
acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing in excess of 51% of the 
voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of Company, in 
each case on terms that the Board of Directors of Company determines, in  its
reasonable judgment (based on advice of a financial advisor of  nationally
recognized reputation) to be more favorable to Company  stockholders from a
financial point of view than the terms of the Merger;  provided, however,
that any such offer shall not be deemed to be a  "Superior Offer" if any
financing required to consummate the transaction  contemplated by such offer
is not committed and is not likely in the  judgment of Company\'s Board of
Directors to be obtained by such third party  on a timely basis.   Section
5.03 Confidentiality; Access to Information.   (a) Confidentiality
Agreement. The parties acknowledge that Company  and Parent have previously
executed a Confidentiality Agreement, dated as  of September 26, 2000 (the

in full force and effect in  accordance with its terms.   (b) Access to
Information. Company will afford Parent and its  accountants, counsel and
other representatives reasonable access during  normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, to the properties, books,  records and personnel of
Company during the period prior to the Effective  Time to obtain all
information concerning the business, including the  status of product
development efforts, properties, results of operations  and personnel of
Company, as Parent may reasonably request. No information  or knowledge
obtained by Parent in any investigation pursuant to this  Section 5.03 will
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or  warranty contained
herein or the conditions to the obligations of the  parties to consummate the
Merger.   Section 5.04 No Solicitation.   (a) From and after the date of
this Agreement until the earlier of the  Effective Time or termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article VII,  Company and its subsidiaries will
not, nor will they authorize or permit  any of their respective officers,
directors, affiliates or employees or any  investment banker, attorney or
other advisor or representative retained by  any of them to, directly or
indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or  induce the making, submission
or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal  (as defined below), (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations  regarding, or furnish to any
person any non-public information with respect  to, or take any other action
to facilitate any inquiries or the making of  any proposal that constitutes
or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any  Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
engage in discussions with any person with  respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) subject to Section 5.02(c),  approve, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into  any letter of intent or similar
document or any contract, agreement or  commitment contemplating or otherwise
relating to any Acquisition  Transaction (as defined below); provided,
however, this Section 5.04(a)  shall not prohibit Company from (A) furnishing
information regarding  Company and its subsidiaries to, entering into a
confidentiality agreement  with or entering into discussions with, any person
or group in response to  a Superior Offer submitted by such person or group
(and not withdrawn) if  (1) neither Company nor any representative of Company
and its subsidiaries   -39-     shall have violated any of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.04,  (2) the Board of Directors of
Company concludes in good faith, after  consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that such action is required  in order for the Board of Directors of
Company to comply with its fiduciary  obligations to Company\'s stockholders
under applicable law, (3) (x) at  least two (2) business days prior to
furnishing any such nonpublic  information to, or entering into discussions
or negotiations with, such  person or group, Company gives Parent written
notice of the identity of  such person or group and of Company\'s intention
to furnish nonpublic  information to, or enter into discussions or
negotiations with, such person  or group and (y) Company receives from such
person or group an executed  confidentiality agreement containing customary
limitations on the use and  disclosure of all written and oral information
furnished to such person or  group by or on behalf of Company, and (4)
contemporaneously with furnishing  any such information to such person or
group, Company furnishes such  information to Parent (to the extent such
information has not been  previously furnished by Company to Parent) or (B)
complying with Rule 14e-2  promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to
an Acquisition Proposal  with respect to which no violation of this Section
5.04 shall have  occurred. Company and its subsidiaries will immediately
cease any and all  existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted  heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Without limiting the  foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set  forth in the preceding two sentences by any officer or
director of Company  or any of its subsidiaries or any investment banker,
attorney or other  advisor or representative of Company or any of its
subsidiaries shall be  deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.04 by Company.
In addition to the  foregoing, Company shall (i) provide Parent with at least
forty-eight (48)  hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided
to the members  of Company\'s Board of Directors) of any meeting of
Company\'s Board of  Directors at which Company\'s Board of Directors is
reasonably expected to  consider a Superior Offer and (ii) provide Parent
with at least three (3)  business days prior written notice (or such lesser
prior notice as provided  to the members of Company\'s Board of Directors) of
a meeting of Company\'s  Board of Directors at which Company\'s Board of
Directors is reasonably  expected to recommend a Superior Offer to its
stockholders and together  with such notice a copy of the definitive
documentation relating to such  Superior Offer.   For purposes of this
Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any offer or proposal (other
than an offer or proposal by Parent) relating to any Acquisition Transaction.
For the purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean any
transaction or series of related transactions other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement involving: (A) any acquisition or purchase
from Company by any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a 15%
interest in the total outstanding voting securities of Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) beneficially owning
15% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of Company or any of
its subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, business combination
or similar transaction involving Company pursuant to which the stockholders
of Company immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 85% of the
equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction;
(B) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business),
exchange, transfer,    -40-     license (other than in the ordinary
course of business), acquisition or disposition of more than 15% of the
assets of Company; or (C) any liquidation or dissolution of Company.   (b)
In addition to the obligations of Company set forth in paragraph  (a) of this
Section 5.04, Company as promptly as practicable shall advise  Parent orally
and in writing of any request received by Company for  information which
Company reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition  Proposal or of any
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry received by Company  with respect to, or
which Company reasonably believes would lead to any  Acquisition Proposal,
the material terms and conditions of such request,  Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry, and the identity of the person or group  making any such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Company will keep  Parent informed in all
material respects of the status and details  (including material amendments
or proposed amendments) of any such request,  Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry.   Section 5.05 Public Disclosure. Parent and Company will consult
with each other, and to the extent practicable, agree, before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the
Merger, this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal and will not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by law or any listing agreement with a national
securities exchange or Nasdaq, in which case reasonable efforts to consult
with the other party will be made prior to such release or public statement.
The parties have agreed to the text of the joint press release announcing the
signing of this Agreement.   Section 5.06 Commercially Reasonable Efforts;
Notification.   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this  Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use commercially
reasonable  efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to  be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all  things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in  the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including to accomplish
the  following: (i) causing the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI
to  be satisfied; (ii) obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers,  consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental
Entities;  (iii) making all necessary registrations, declarations and
filings  (including registrations, declarations and filings with
Governmental  Entities, if any); (iv) avoiding any suit, claim, action,
investigation or  proceeding by any Governmental Entity challenging the
Merger or any other  transaction contemplated by this Agreement; (v)
obtaining all consents,  approvals or waivers from third parties required as
a result of the  transactions contemplated in this Agreement; (vi) defending
any suits,  claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial
or  administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the 
transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or 
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental 
Entity vacated or reversed; and (vii) executing or delivering any  additional
instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions  contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In  connection
with and without limiting the foregoing, subject to the other  terms and
conditions hereof, Company and its Board of Directors shall, if   
-41-     any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or
becomes  applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, use commercially reasonable
efforts and  take all acts necessary to ensure that the Merger and the
other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly  as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to  minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the
Merger, this  Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed  to require Parent or Company or any subsidiary or affiliate
thereof to  agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its affiliates of
shares of  capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or the
imposition of  any material limitation on the ability of any of them to
conduct their  business or to own or exercise control of such assets,
properties and  stock.   (b) Company shall give prompt notice to Parent
upon becoming aware  that any representation or warranty made by it contained
in this Agreement  has become untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of
Company to comply  with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or  agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, in  each case, where the conditions set forth in Section 6.03(a)
or Section  6.03(b) would not be satisfied as a result thereof; provided,
however, that  no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties,  covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations  of the parties under this Agreement.   (c) Parent shall give
prompt notice to Company upon becoming aware  that any representation or
warranty made by it or Merger Sub contained in  this Agreement has become
untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of Parent  or Merger Sub to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any  covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it  under this Agreement, in each case,
where the conditions set forth in  Section 6.02(a) or Section 6.02(b) would
not be satisfied as a result  thereof; provided, however, that no such
notification shall affect the  representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the  conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement.   Section 5.07 Third Party Consents. As soon
as practicable following the date hereof, Parent and Company will each use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents, waivers and
approvals under any of its or its subsidiaries\' respective agreements,
contracts, licenses or leases required to be obtained in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 5.08 Stock
Options; ESPP and Employee Benefits.   (a) Stock Options. At the Effective
Time, Parent shall assume the  Company Stock Option Plans and each
outstanding option to purchase shares  of Company Common Stock (each, a
"Company Stock Option") under the Company  Option Plans, whether or not
vested, shall be assumed by Parent. Each  Company Stock Option so assumed by
Parent under this Agreement will  continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions of such  Company Stock Options immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including,  without limitation, any repurchase rights or
vesting provisions and  provisions regarding the acceleration of vesting on
certain transactions),  except that (i) each Company Stock Option will be
exercisable (or will    -42-     become exercisable in accordance with
its terms) for that number of whole  shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product of the number of shares  of Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon exercise of such Company  Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the  Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of  Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share
exercise price for the shares of  Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of such assumed Company Stock  Option will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise  price per share of Company Common Stock
at which such Company Stock Option  was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Exchange  Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.
Parent shall comply with the  terms of all such Company Stock Options and use
its best efforts to ensure,  to the extent required by and subject to the
provisions of, the Company  Option Plans, and to the extent permitted under
the Code, that any Company  Stock Options that qualified for tax treatment as
incentive stock options  under Section 422 of the Code prior to the Effective
Time continue to so  qualify after the Effective Time. Parent shall take all
corporate actions  necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Parent  Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of assumed Company
Stock Options on  the terms set forth in this Section 5.08(a).   (b) ESPP.
At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the ESPP in  accordance with its
terms, and all outstanding rights to purchase shares of  Company Common Stock
under the ESPP ("Purchase Rights"), shall be converted  (in accordance with
the Exchange Ratio) into rights to purchase shares of  Parent Common Stock
(with the number of shares rounded down to the nearest  whole share and the
purchase price as of the offering date for each  offering period in effect as
of the Effective Time rounded up to the  nearest whole cent). All such
converted Purchase Rights shall be assumed by  Parent, and each offering
period in effect under the ESPP immediately prior  to the Effective Time
shall be continued in accordance with the terms of  the ESPP until the end of
such offering period. The ESPP shall terminate  with the exercise of the last
assumed Purchase Right, and no additional  Purchase Rights shall be granted
under the ESPP following the Effective  Time, provided that references to
Company in the ESPP and related documents  shall mean Parent (except that the
purchase price for a relevant period  shall be determined with respect to the
fair market value of Company Common  Stock on such date, as adjusted hereby).
Parent shall take all corporate  action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of  Parent Common Stock for issuance upon
exercise of Purchase Rights under the  ESPP assumed in accordance with this
Section 5.08(b). Parent agrees that,  from and after the Effective Time,
Company\'s employees may participate in  the employee stock purchase plan
sponsored by Parent ("Parent ESPP"),  subject to the terms and conditions of
the Parent ESPP, and that service  with Company shall be treated as service
with the Parent for determining  eligibility of Company\'s employees under
the Parent ESPP.   (c) 401(k). Company shall terminate, effective as of the
day  immediately preceding the Effective Time, any and all 401(k) plans 
sponsored or maintained by Company unless Parent provides written notice to 
Company prior to the Effective Time that any such 401(k) plan shall not be 
terminated. Parent shall receive from Company evidence that Company\'s 
plan(s) and / or program(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of 
Company\'s Board of Directors (the form and substance of such resolutions 
shall be subject to review and approval of Parent), effective as of the
day   -43-     immediately preceding the Effective Time. Company
employees shall be  eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan sponsored by
Parent no later than  the first day of the next commencing month immediately
after the Effective  Time.   (d) Benefits; Prior Service. From and after
the Effective Time,  Company employees shall be provided with employee
benefits that are the  same as those provided to employees of Parent who are
similarly situated  and which are substantially similar in the aggregate to
those provided such  employees prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall
cause employees of  Company and its subsidiaries to be credited with service
with Company and  each of its subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and
vesting under each  employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or its
subsidiaries after the  Effective Time to the extent of their service with
Company; provided,  however, that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such  recognition would result in duplication of benefits.  
Section 5.09 Form S-8. Parent agrees to file a registration statement on Form
S-8 for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to
assumed Company Stock Options as soon as is reasonably practicable (and in
any event within 30 days) after the Effective Time and shall maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement thereafter for so long as any of
such options or other rights remain outstanding.   Section 5.10
Indemnification.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause
the Surviving  Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of Company  (or any predecessor corporation) pursuant to (i) each
indemnification  agreement between Company and its directors or officers in
effect  immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties")
and  (ii) any indemnification provision under the Company Charter Documents
as  in effect on the date hereof. The Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws  of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect
to  exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the 
Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Company Charter Documents as 
in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended,  repealed
or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the  Effective Time
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights  thereunder of any
Indemnified Party or of individuals who, immediately  prior to the Effective
Time, were employees or agents of Company, unless  such modification is
required by law.   (b) In the event Company or the Surviving Corporation or
any of their  respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any  other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or  entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers a
material amount  of its properties and assets to any person in a single
transaction or a  series of transactions, then, and in each such case, Parent
will either  guarantee or otherwise remain liable for the indemnification
obligations  referred to in this Section 5.10 or will make or cause to be
made proper  provision so that the successors and assigns of Company or the
Surviving  Corporation, as the case may be, assume the indemnification
obligations  described herein for the benefit of the Indemnified
Parties.    -44-      (c) The provisions of this Section 5.10 shall
survive consummation of  the Merger and are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be  enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
(ii) in addition to,  and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or  contribution that any such Indemnified Party may have by
contract or  otherwise.   (d) For a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, Parent  will either (i) cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain in effect, if  available, directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance covering those  persons who are currently covered by Company\'s
directors\' and officers\'  liability insurance policy on terms comparable to
those applicable to the  current directors and officers of Company; provided,
however, that in no  event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend in  excess of 150% of the annual premium currently paid by
Company for such  coverage (or such coverage as is available for such 150% of
such annual  premium), or (ii) Parent may purchase directors\' and officers\'
liability  tail coverage on terms comparable to those applicable to the
current  directors and officers of Company covering all periods prior to
the  Effective Time.   Section 5.11 Affiliate Agreements; Pooling
Actions.   (a) Set forth in Section 5.11(a) of the Company Schedule is a
list of  those persons who may be deemed to be, in Company\'s reasonable
judgment,  affiliates of Company within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated
under the  Securities Act or Opinion 16 of the Accounting Principles Board
applicable  to SEC rules and regulations (each, a "Company Affiliate").
Company will  provide Parent with such information and documents as Parent
reasonably  requests for purposes of reviewing such list. Company will use
its  commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to 
Parent, on or as promptly as practicable following the date hereof, from 
each Company Affiliate that has not delivered a Company Affiliate Agreement 
on or prior to the date hereof, an executed Company Affiliate Agreement. 
Each Company Affiliate Agreement will be in full force and effect as of the 
Effective Time. Parent will be entitled to place appropriate legends on the 
certificates evidencing any Parent Common Stock to be received by a Company 
Affiliate pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to issue appropriate 
stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the Parent Common 
Stock, consistent with the terms of the Company Affiliate Agreement.   (b)
Promptly after execution of this Agreement, Parent will take the  actions
specified in Section 3.18 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.   Section 5.12
Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Efforts. As soon as may be reasonably
practicable, Company and Parent each shall file with the United States
Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice ("DOJ") Notification and Report Forms relating
to the transactions contemplated herein as required by the HSR Act, as well
as comparable pre-merger notification forms required by the
merger notification or control laws and regulations of any other
applicable jurisdiction, as agreed to by the parties. Company and Parent each
shall each use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain early
termination of any waiting period under HSR and Company and Parent shall each
promptly (a) supply    -45-    the other with any information which may
be required in order to effectuate such filings and (b) supply any additional
information which reasonably may be required by the FTC, the DOJ or the
competition or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction and which
the parties may reasonably deem appropriate; provided, however, that Parent
shall not be required to agree to any divestiture by Parent or Company or any
of Parent\'s subsidiaries or affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any
business, assets or property of Parent or its subsidiaries or affiliates or
of Company, its affiliates, or the imposition of any material limitation on
the ability of any of them to conduct their businesses or to own or exercise
control of such assets, properties and stock.   Section 5.13 Action by Board
of Directors. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent,
or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretative guidance of the SEC so that (i)
the assumption of Company Stock Options by Company Insiders (as defined
below) pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) the receipt by Company Insiders
of Parent Common Stock in exchange for Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger, shall in each case be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section
16 of the Exchange Act by any officer or director of Company who may become a
covered person of Parent for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act (a
"Company Insider").   Section 5.14 Nasdaq Listing. Parent shall authorize
for listing on Nasdaq the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable, and those

of interests" method of  accounting is used and (ii) from KPMG LLP,
independent accountants for  Parent, a copy of a letter addressed to Parent
