Section 2.3 Working Capital Adjustment.

(a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the
Sellers a consolidated balance sheet of the Business as of the Closing Date
(and after taking into account the transfers of the Business Assets
hereunder), prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistent with past practices
of the Company prior to the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"),
together with all supporting work papers used or produced in connection with
the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet. The Closing Balance Sheet shall
become final and binding on the 60th day following delivery thereof, unless at
or prior to the end of such period, the Sellers delivers to the Buyer written
notice of their disagreement (a "Notice of Disagreement") specifying the
nature and amount of any disputed item. The Sellers shall be deemed to have
agreed with all items and amounts in the Closing Balance Sheet not
specifically referenced in the Notice of Disagreement, and such items and
amounts shall not be subject to review in accordance with Section 2.3(b).

(b) During the 20 day period following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement by
the Sellers to the Buyer, the parties in good faith shall seek to resolve in
writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified therein. Any disputed items resolved in writing between the Sellers
and the Buyer within such 20 day period shall be final and binding with
respect to such items, and if the Sellers and the Buyer agree in writing on
the resolution of each disputed item specified by the Sellers in the Notice of
Disagreement and the revised Closing Balance Sheet, the amounts set forth in
such revised Closing Balance Sheet shall be final and binding on the parties
for all purposes hereunder. If the Sellers and the Buyer have not resolved all
such differences by the end of such 20 day period, the Sellers and the Buyer
shall submit, in writing, to an independent public accounting firm (the
"Independent Accounting Firm"), their briefs detailing their views as to the
correct nature and amount of each item remaining in dispute, and the
Independent Accounting Firm shall make a written determination of the amount
of



Working Capital Deficit or Working Capital Excess as of the Closing Date and
the resulting Purchase Price, which determination shall be final and binding
on the parties for all purposes hereunder. The determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm may give effect to the retention of Working
Capital Retained Assets or Working Capital Retained Liabilities (to the extent
still in existence as of the date of determination) in order to reduce or
eliminate any Working Capital Excess or Working Capital Deficits,
respectively. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be authorized to resolve
only those items remaining in dispute between the parties in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 2.3 within the range of the difference between
the Buyer's position with respect thereto and the Sellers' position with
respect thereto. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be Deloitte or, if such
firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other independent public accounting
firm as shall be agreed in writing by the Sellers and the Buyer. The Sellers
and the Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Independent Accounting Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters
submitted to it within 30 days following the submission thereof. Judgment may
be entered upon the written determination of the Independent Accounting Firm
in accordance with Section 10.9. In acting under this Agreement, the
Independent Accounting Firm will be entitled to the privileges and immunities
of an arbitrator.

(c) The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and of any
enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by the parties in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the
Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm
at the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the
matters submitted and in accordance with the standards provided for herein.
For example, if the Buyer asserts that the final Purchase Price is
$180,000,000 and the Sellers assert that the final Purchase Price is
$181,000,000, and as a result of the final determination, the final Purchase
Price is $180,700,000, the Buyer would bear 70% of the fees and the Sellers
would bear 30% of the fees. The fees and disbursements of the Representatives
of each party incurred in connection with their preparation or review of the
Closing Balance Sheet and preparation or review of any Notice of Disagreement,
as applicable, shall be borne by such party.

(d) Each of the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand,
will afford the other party and its Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to the books, records
and properties relating to the Business and to any other information
reasonably requested for purposes of preparing and reviewing the calculations
contemplated by this Section 2.3. Each party shall authorize its accountants
to disclose work papers generated by such accountants in connection with the
preparing and reviewing the Closing Balance Sheet as specified in this Section
2.3; provided that such accountants shall not be obligated to make any work
papers available except in accordance with such accountants' disclosure
procedures and then only after the non-client party has signed an agreement
(in customary form) relating to access to such work papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants.



(e) The Buyer shall pay to the Sellers the amount, if any, by which the
Purchase Price, as finally determined under Section 2.3(c), is greater than
the Estimated Purchase Price, and the Sellers shall pay to the Buyer the
amount, if any, by which the Purchase Price, as finally determined under
Section 2.3(c), is less than the Estimated Purchase Price.

(f) Payments in respect of Section 2.3(e) shall be made within three (3)
Business Days of final determination of the Closing Balance Sheet pursuant to
the provisions of this Section 2.3 by wire transfer of United States dollars
in immediately available funds to such account or accounts as may be
designated in writing by the party entitled to such payment at least two
Business Days prior to such payment date.

Section 2.4 Consents and Waivers; Further Assurances.

(a) Nothing in this Agreement or the Transaction Documents shall be construed
as an agreement to lease, sell, assign, transfer or deliver any Assumed
Contract or other Business Asset that by its terms or pursuant to applicable
Law is not capable of being leased, sold, assigned, transferred or delivered
without the consent or waiver of a third party or Governmental Authority
unless and until such consent or waiver shall be given. Subject to Section
5.4, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and Buyer shall
cooperate in full with all reasonable requests of Sellers, to obtain such
consents and waivers and to resolve the impediments to the lease, sale,
assignment, transfer or delivery contemplated by this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents and to obtain any other consents and waivers necessary
to convey to Buyer all the Assumed Contracts and the Business Assets. In the
event any such consents or waivers required to transfer the Assumed Contracts
or Business Assets are not obtained prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall,
subject to Section 5.4, continue to use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the relevant consents or waivers until such
consents or waivers are obtained, and Sellers shall cooperate in full with all
reasonable requests of Buyer in any lawful arrangement to provide that the
Buyer shall receive the interest of Sellers in the benefits under any such
Assumed Contracts or Business Assets, including performance by Sellers, as
agent; provided, that the Buyer shall undertake to pay or satisfy the
corresponding liabilities for the enjoyment of such benefit to the extent the
Buyer would have been responsible therefor hereunder if such consents or
waivers had been obtained.

(b) From time to time, whether before, at or following the Closing, Sellers
and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and Related
Parties to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further conveyances,
notices, assumptions and releases and such other instruments, and shall take
such further actions, as may be necessary or appropriate to assure fully to
Buyer all of the properties, rights, titles, interests, estates, remedies,
powers and privileges intended to be conveyed, sold, leased, assigned,
transferred or delivered to Buyer under this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents, including as may be necessary to deliver the Business Assets free
and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances, and to
otherwise make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.



(c) From time to time following the Closing, upon Buyer's request and to the
extent required to transfer any Assumed Contracts or Business Assets that have
not otherwise been transferred at the Closing, each Seller shall cause any
Related Party to execute, acknowledge and deliver all such conveyances,
notices, assumptions and releases and such other instruments, and shall take
such further actions, as may be necessary or appropriate to assure fully to
Buyer all of the properties, rights, titles, interests, estates, remedies,
powers and privileges intended to be conveyed, sold, leased, assigned,
transferred or delivered to Buyer under this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents, including as may be necessary to deliver the Business Assets owned
or held by any such Related Party free and clear of all Encumbrances other
than Permitted Encumbrances, and to otherwise make effective as promptly as
practicable the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

Section 5.9 Employee Matters.

(a) On or before the date selected by Buyer, which date shall be within five
Business Days after the Closing Date (the "Transition Date"), the Buyer shall,
or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, extend offers of employment to each
employee of the



Business listed on Schedule 5.9 of the Seller Disclosure Letter ("Business
Employee") who is actively at work as of the Closing Date, which offers shall
be subject to Buyer's customary and generally applicable conditions of
employment (all such employees who accept the Buyer's offer of employment are
referred to as the "Transferring Employees"). Subject to the requirements of
applicable Law, Seller will deliver such other employee information regarding
the Business Employees as may be reasonably requested by Buyer at Closing. For
purposes of this Agreement, any Business Employee who is not at work on the
Closing Date due to a short-term absence (including due to vacation, holiday,
jury duty, illness, authorized short-term leave of absence or short-term
disability) shall be deemed to be "actively at work"; provided, that any such
individuals that are on authorized short-term leave of absence or short-term
disability shall not be deemed to constitute "Transferring Employees" until

employment. The Company shall terminate the employment of all Transferring
Employees immediately prior to the Transition Date, provided, that the Company
shall terminate the employment of any Business Employee who at Closing is on a
short-term leave of absence or short-term disability and who subsequently

Seller at a fixed rate per day for each day during the Transition Date
pursuant to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement.

employee, former employee or beneficiary of any such employee or former
employee who is covered under any group health plan, as defined in Section
5000(b)(1) of the Code (a "Group Health Plan"), maintained by the Seller as of
the Transition Date or whose "qualifying event" within the meaning of Section
4980B(f) of the Code occurs on or prior to the Closing Date, whether pursuant
to the provisions of COBRA or otherwise. The Buyer shall comply with the
provisions of COBRA with respect to Transferring Employees who are covered
under any Group Health Plan maintained by the Buyer after the Transition Date.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Transferring Employee, any beneficiary or dependents
thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to
the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and benefits that may be
provided to any Transferring Employee by the Buyer or under any benefit plan
that the Buyer may maintain.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon any Transferring
Employee any right with respect to continued employment by the Buyer, nor
shall anything herein interfere with the right of the Buyer to terminate the
employment of any Transferring Employee at any time, with or without cause,
following the effective date of his or her employment with the Buyer, or
restrict the Buyer in the exercise of its independent business judgment in
modifying any of the terms and conditions of the employment of the
Transferring Employees.

furnishing each other with any and all Tax information as the other may
reasonably request, with respect to Tax matters pertaining to the Business
Assets or the Business; provided, however, that notwithstanding this Section
6.1 or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Buyer be
required to provide or disclose any income Tax Return or any information
relating to any period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date.

Section 6.2 Pro Rations. All real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and
similar ad valorem obligations levied with respect to the Business Assets for
a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date will be
apportioned between Sellers and Buyer as of the Closing Date based on the
number of days of such taxable period prior to and including the Closing Date
and the number of days of such taxable period following the Closing Date, but
only to the extent that such Taxes were not included in the Working Capital on
the Closing Balance Sheet. Upon presentation of an invoice by the party
entitled to any payment under this Section 6.2, together with such
documentation reasonably necessary to establish the amount owed by each party,
the other party will, promptly, but in no event later than 30 days after such
request and documentation are presented, reimburse the requesting party for
the amount due, provided that such reimbursement shall be equitably adjusted
for the amount of such Taxes taken into account as a liability in the Closing
Balance Sheet as finally determined. Buyer will be responsible for any
Transfer Taxes.

that the foregoing shall not apply to claims for intentional fraud.

Section 8.2 Indemnification by POWDR. POWDR shall save, defend, indemnify and
hold harmless the Buyer and its Representatives, successors and assigns of
each of the foregoing from and against any and all losses, damages,
liabilities, deficiencies, claims, interest, awards, judgments, penalties,

Assumed Liability.

Section 8.4 Procedures.

(a) In order for a party (the "Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out
of or involving a Loss or a claim or demand made by any Person or Governmental
Authority against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"), such
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice thereof to the party against whom
indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") with reasonable promptness
after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party
Claim and shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such information with
respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure
to provide such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 15 days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified
Party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense
thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party (which expenses shall not be
applied against any indemnity limitation herein) with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim for, or
Action including equitable or injunctive relief or any claim that would



impose criminal liability or damages, and the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to defend, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, any such Third
Party Claim or Action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall assume the
defense of the Tendered Claims, but in each case only to the extent such
tender does not adversely affect available insurance coverage under applicable
policies. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party does not expressly elect to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim within the time period and otherwise in accordance with the
first sentence of this Section 8.4(b), the Indemnified Party shall have the
sole right to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to
participate in (but not control) the defense thereof, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party
unless the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized
in writing by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, at the
Indemnifying Party's expense, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such
defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, pertinent
records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party's possession or
under the Indemnified Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably
required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement
or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such
Third Party Claim if such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) involves a
finding or admission of wrongdoing, (ii) does not include an unconditional
written release by the claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all
liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (iii) imposes equitable
remedies or any obligation on the Indemnified Party other than solely the
payment of money damages for which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified
hereunder. If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party, enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim without the
consent of the Indemnifying Party.

(c) The indemnification required hereunder in respect of a Third Party Claim
owing by an Indemnifying Party shall be made by payment of the amount of
actual Losses in connection therewith within five Business Days after receipt
by the Indemnifying Party of notice of such Losses.

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to require that any action be
made or brought against any other Person before action is brought or claim is
made against it hereunder by the Indemnified Party.

(e) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall



deliver notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying
Party. The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article VIII except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure.

Section 8.5 Limits on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement:

(a) An Indemnified Party shall take and shall cause its Affiliates to take all
reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event which
would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto;

(b) Sellers will not cancel, let lapse or reduce coverage of any insurance
policy covering an Insured Claim, and will cooperate with Buyer, including
acting or refraining from acting at Buyer's reasonable direction (and at
Buyer's sole cost and expense), with respect to any applicable insurance claim
or coverage in connection with the defense, prosecution or settlement of any
Insured Claim; and

(c) the amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Article VIII shall be net of any amounts actually recovered or recoverable by
the Indemnified Party pursuant to any contract to which it is a Party, any
applicable insurance coverage or otherwise with respect to such Losses (net of
any Tax or costs and expenses incurred in connection with such recovery). An
Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover
under such insurance coverage and from any third party alleged to be
responsible for any Losses prior to seeking indemnification under this
Agreement.

Section 8.6 Exclusive Remedy. Except to the extent of the remedies provided
for in Section 10.11 (Enforcement), and except in the case of intentional
fraud, the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims arising (directly
or indirectly) under, out of, or related to this Agreement (including the
transactions contemplated hereby and any representations and warranties set
forth herein, made in connection herewith), or the sale and purchase of the
Business Assets, shall be the rights of indemnification set forth in Article
VIII only, and no Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse,
whether in contract, tort or otherwise, or whether at law or in equity, it
being agreed that all of such other remedies, entitlements and recourse are
expressly waived and released by the parties hereto to the fullest extent
permitted by Law. The provisions of this Section 8.6, and the remedies
provided in Section 10.11, were specifically bargained for among Buyer and the
Sellers in arriving at the Purchase Price and in agreeing to provide the
specific representations and warranties set forth herein. The Sellers have
specifically relied upon the provisions of this Section 8.6, in agreeing to
the Purchase Price and in agreeing to provide the specific representations and
warranties set forth herein.

Section 8.7 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The Sellers and Buyer agree
to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article VIII as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign income
tax purposes

suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the courts described above,
other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any

provided, however, that the Buyer may assign this Agreement to any Affiliate
of the Buyer without the prior consent of the Sellers; provided further, that
no assignment shall relieve the assignor of any of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

Section 10.11 Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not

Accordingly, each of the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of

of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any Utah State or federal court, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties agree that the covenants
under Article II are covenants for which specific performance will be
available. In connection with any action for equitable relief under this
Section 10.11, the costs and expenses of the prevailing party (including
reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
defending the foregoing), shall be paid by the losing party, as determined by

any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision
had never been contained herein.
