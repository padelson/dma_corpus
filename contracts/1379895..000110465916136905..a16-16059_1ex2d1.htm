being understood that, for purposes of this _Section 5.02(b)_ the Acquired

 



      
 

 



 

Companies shall not be deemed Affiliates of the Sellers) and Representatives,
except, in each case, to the extent that: (a) the applicable Party or its
Affiliates or Representatives are required to disclose such information by or
pursuant to applicable Law, or (b) such information can be shown to have been
in the public domain (so long as such Party and its Representatives were not
responsible for such information becoming public); _provided_ that information
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby which a Governmental
Entity may require a Party to disclose in the ordinary course (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, to obtain any Required Consents), shall not be subject
to the terms of this _Section 5.02(b)_. In addition, in the case of clause
(a), to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the disclosing Party agrees
that it and its Affiliates and Representatives will provide the other Parties
with prompt written notice of such requirement or request so that such Party
may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive
compliance with the terms of this _Section 5.02(b)_. Each Party agrees that
it and its Affiliates and Representatives will use reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with the other Parties, to the extent permitted by applicable Law
and at the sole cost and expense of the other Parties, to obtain such a
protective order or other remedy and to delay or cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to delay such disclosure in the meantime. Each Party agrees to
disclose or furnish and cause its Affiliates and Representatives to disclose
or furnish, only that portion of the information that such Party, Affiliate or
Representative concludes, after consultation with counsel, is required by
applicable Law to be disclosed or furnished, and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and at the sole cost and expense of the other Parties, each
Party agrees that it and its Affiliates and Representatives will use
reasonable best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will
be accorded such information; _provided_ that this provision will not be
construed to require such Party or its Affiliates or Representatives to
undertake any litigation or other Claims. Each Party agrees in any event to
give prompt written notice to the other party hereto of any proposed
disclosure made by it or its respective Affiliates or Representatives pursuant
to this _Section 5.02(b)_, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 5.02(b)_ will preclude any Party
from disclosing any such information for the purposes of any Claims arising
out of or relating to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

SECTION 5.03 _Post-Closing Books and Records; Financial Statements_. From and
after the Tier One Closing Date, the Sellers and their respective Affiliates
shall be entitled to retain copies (at the Sellers sole cost and expense) of
any books, records or other documents which pertain to the Sellers ownership
or operation of the Acquired Companies prior to the Tier One Closing Date. The
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, retain, for at
least five (5) years after the Tier One Closing Date, all books, records and

without significant disruption to the Acquired Companies business and upon
reasonable request and reasonable advance notice. At and after the expiration
of such period, if the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates have
previously requested in writing that such books and records be preserved, the
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, either preserve
such books and records for such reasonable period as may be requested by the

Party shall permit counsel for the other Parties a reasonable opportunity to
review and provide comments thereon, and consider in good faith the views of
the other Parties in connection with, any proposed communication to such
Governmental Entity (or members of its staff) to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. Each of the Purchaser and the Sellers agree not to participate
in any meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transaction unless it
consults with the other Parties in advance and, to the extent not prohibited

prior to the Tier One Closing, for each such Support Obligation not assumed by
the Purchaser as of the Tier One Closing, as set forth on _Schedule 5.06(b)_ ,
substitute credit support arrangements in replacement for such Support
Obligations, including the novation of any letter of credit listed in
_Schedule 5.06(c)_ , and shall procure that the Sellers, their respective
Affiliates and, where applicable, their sureties or letter of credit issuers
shall be fully and unconditionally released from their respective obligations
under the Support Obligations, in each case, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding

would make any of the representations or warranties in _Article 3_ inaccurate
or incorrect (each, a " _Schedule Update_"). Subject to the rights of the
Purchaser under _Section 9.01(e)_, any such Schedule Update shall be deemed
to have amended the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, and any fact, circumstance,
development, event or occurrence disclosed in such Schedule Update

 



      
 

 



 

shall be deemed incorporated into the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, in each
case as of the date hereof for all purposes hereof, including for purposes of

One Closing Date. The Purchaser shall honor any commitment of the Sellers
Affiliates to reemploy after the Tier One Closing Date any Business Employee
who is not actively at work on the Tier One Closing Date due to leave of
absence, disability leave, military leave or workers compensation leave ("
_Inactive Employees_ "), provided such Inactive Employees present themselves
for work within one year following the Tier One Closing Date, or such longer
period as required by Law, and at the time any Inactive Employee accepts such
offer of employment he or she will be a Transferred Employee.

 



 

(b) For the period commencing on the Tier One Closing Date and continuing
through the date that is twelve (12) months following the Tier One Closing
Date (the " _Continuation Period_ "), the Purchaser shall cause the Post-
Closing Employer to provide each Transferred Employee with annual base salary
or hourly wages and annual and long-term incentive target incentive
compensation opportunities (which long-term incentive target incentive
compensation opportunity the Parties agree has an aggregate value for all
Transferred Employees equal to $113,000), and employee benefits, which, in the
aggregate, are no less than the annual base salary or hourly wages and annual
and long-term incentive target incentive compensation opportunities, and
employee benefits, respectively, payable or provided to such Transferred
Employee immediately before the Tier One Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) in no event shall the Post-Closing Employer be obligated to
provide the required employee benefits in any particular form, including in
the form of retiree medical benefits or defined benefit pension, and (ii) the
value attributable to any long-term target incentive compensation opportunity
may be provided in any form, including additional cash compensation or
additional or improved employee benefits.

 



 

(c) If during the Continuation Period the employment of any Transferred
Employee is terminated for other than cause, the Purchaser shall cause the
Post-Closing Employer to provide such Transferred Employee with severance pay
and benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the severance
pay and benefits to which such Transferred Employee would have been entitled
under the Pre-Closing Employee Plans (excluding any severance and pay benefits
provided under the Dynegy Inc. 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan) had the
Transferred Employees employment terminated immediately before the Tier One
Closing under similar circumstances.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Purchaser shall cause the Post-Closing Employer to (i) credit for
purposes of eligibility and vesting (and benefit accrual with respect to
vacation and severance) under the Post-Closing Employer Plans (excluding the
Dynegy Inc. 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan) the service that was credited for
such respective purposes under the Pre-Closing Employee Plans in respect of
each Transferred Employee immediately before the Tier One Closing Date, (ii)
waive all limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to Transferred Employees and their spouses and
dependents, if applicable, under the Post-Closing Employee Plans (excluding
the Dynegy Inc. 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan), and (iii) provide each
Transferred Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
under the Pre-Closing Employee Plans prior to the Tier One Closing Date in
satisfying any deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under Post-Closing
Employee Plans for the plan year in which the Tier One Closing Date occurs.

 



 

(e) The Purchaser shall cause the Post-Closing Employer to accept a transfer
from any Pre-Closing Employee Plan that is a flexible spending account plan of
the balance of each Transferred Employees account thereunder as of the Tier
One Closing Date and credit such employee with such amounts under a Post-
Closing Employee Plan that is a flexible spending account plan. As soon as
practicable after the Tier One Closing, (i) the Sellers shall pay to the
Purchaser in cash the amount, if any, by which aggregate contributions made by
Transferred Employees to the Pre-Closing Employee Plan flexible spending
account plan for the plan year in which the Tier One Closing occurs exceeded
the aggregate benefits provided to Transferred Employees under such plan for
such plan year as of the Tier One Closing, or (ii) the Purchaser shall pay to
the Sellers in cash the amount, if any, by which aggregate benefits provided
to Transferred Employees under the Pre-Closing Employee Plan flexible spending
account plan for the plan year in which the Tier One Closing occurs exceeded
the aggregate contributions made by Transferred Employees under such plan for
such plan year as of the Tier One Closing.

 



 

(f) The Purchaser shall cause the Post-Closing Employer to provide each
Transferred Employee as of the Tier One Closing Date with credit for all of
the Transferred Employees earned but unused vacation and sick leave and other
paid time-off accrued as of the Tier One Closing Date under the time-off
policies maintained by the Sellers or their respective Affiliates, as
applicable.

 



 

(g) As soon as practicable following the Tier One Closing Date, the Sellers
shall cause any Pre-Closing Employee Plan that is intended to satisfy Section
401(a) of the Code (a " _Seller 401(a) Plan_") to make, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, cash distributions (but including promissory
notes representing participant loans) available to Transferred Employees. The
Purchaser shall cause the Post-Closing Employer to establish or maintain a
defined contribution plan and trust, intended to satisfy Section 401(a) of the
Code, that shall accept a contribution in cash or, to the extent of any
promissory notes representing participant loans, in kind, attributable to any
eligible rollover distribution (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code) of the benefit of a Transferred Employee under the Seller 401(a)
Plan; _provided_ that the obligation to accept such a rollover in kind shall
expire six (6) months after the Tier One Closing Date. The Parties agree to
cooperate (and the Purchaser shall cause the Post-Closing Employer to
cooperate) so as, to the extent practicable, to cause any loan with respect to
a Transferred Employees account under the Seller 401(a) Plan to not be in
default during the period from the Tier One Closing Date until such a rollover
(if any) is completed; _provided_

 



      
 

 



 

 _further_ , that any affected Transferred Employee shall have continued to
make loan repayments on a timely basis during such period in accordance with
the Seller 401(a) Plans procedures. The Sellers shall cause all Transferred
Employees to be fully vested in their account balances under each Seller
401(a) Plan effective as of Closing.

 



 

(h) Except as specifically provided under this _Section 5.11_, the Sellers or
their Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) shall retain and be
responsible for all liabilities, obligations, costs or expenses arising under
or in connection with any Pre-Closing Employee Plan. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies) shall retain and be responsible for all liabilities, obligations,
costs or expenses arising under or in connection with Dynegy Inc. 2012 Long
Term Incentive Plan, including the termination of the Transferred Employees
participation in such plan.

 



 

(i) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall (i) be treated
as an amendment or other modification of any Pre-Closing Employee Plan, Post-
Closing Employee Plan or other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement;
(ii) limit the right of the Sellers, the Purchaser or the Post-Closing
Employer or their respective Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise
modify any Pre-Closing Employee Plan, Post-Closing Employee Plan or other
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement; or (iii) confer upon any Person
any right to employment, any right to compensation or benefits, or any other
right of any kind or nature whatsoever.

from and after the Tier One Closing, the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause
the Acquired Companies and their Affiliates not to, use the Seller Marks or
any patents or other Intellectual Property rights belonging to the Sellers or
their Affiliates that have not been expressly conveyed to the Purchaser or the
Acquired Companies, and the Purchaser acknowledges that it, its Affiliates and
the Acquired Companies have no rights whatsoever to use the Seller Marks.

 



 

(b) In connection with any use of the Seller Marks by the Purchaser or the
Acquired Companies to the extent expressly permitted pursuant to this _Section
5.12_, the Purchaser shall and shall cause the Acquired Companies to comply

than the Acquired Companies) quality control requirements, policies and
guidelines in effect at such time and as may be provided to the Purchaser or

(d) This _Section 8.02_ is subject to the limitations set forth in _Section

SECTION 8.03 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) If an Indemnified Purchaser Entity or an Indemnified Seller Entity (each,
an " _Indemnified Entity_ ") believes that a Claim or other fact or
circumstance exists that has given or may give rise to a right of
indemnification under this _Article 8_ (whether or not the amount of
Indemnifiable Losses relating thereto is then quantifiable), such Indemnified
Entity shall assert its Claim for indemnification by giving written notice
thereof (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Party from which indemnification is
sought pursuant to _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.02_, as applicable (the "
_Indemnifying Entity_ "). The Claim Notice shall be given promptly (and in any
event within ten (10) Business Days) after the Indemnified Entity becomes
aware of any fact or circumstance that may give rise to a Claim for indemnity.
Each Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of the Claim,
identify the sections of this Agreement that form the basis of such Claim,
attach copies of all material written evidence thereof received from any
Person not a Party or affiliated with any Party (a " _Third Party_ ") to the
date of the Claim Notice and set forth the estimated amount of Indemnifiable
Losses relating thereto to the extent reasonably estimable. The failure of the
Indemnified Entity to notify or a delay in notifying the Indemnifying Entity,
as the case may be, will not relieve the Indemnifying Entity of its
obligations pursuant to this _Article 8_, except to the extent that such
Indemnifying Entity is materially prejudiced as a result thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnifying Entity shall not be liable for any costs or
expenses incurred by the Indemnified Entity in defending or investigating such
Claim during the period in which the Indemnified Entity failed to give the
Claim Notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no Claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.01(a)(i)
_arising out of a Claim relating to Taxes may be asserted unless (i) a Taxing
Authority has actually commenced a lawsuit, action or regulatory proceeding or
issued a written notice of proposed adjustment, assessment or deficiency, in
each case, with respect to the specific matters addressed in such Claim and
(ii) such Claim for indemnification is made in respect of a reasonably
expected amount of Indemnifiable Losses in connection with the Claim by such
Taxing Authority.

 



 

(b) Upon receipt by an Indemnifying Entity of a Claim Notice in respect of a
Claim brought by a Third Party, the Indemnifying Entity shall be entitled to
(i) assume and have

 



      
 

 



 

sole control over the defense and investigation of such Claim at its sole cost
and expense (subject to the last sentence of this _Section 8.03(b)_) and with
counsel of its own choosing if it gives notice of its intention to do so to
the Indemnified Entity within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such Claim
Notice from the Indemnified Entity and (ii) negotiate a settlement or
compromise of, or consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to, such
Claim; _provided_ , that if such settlement, compromise or consent does not
include a full and unconditional waiver and release by the Third Party of all
applicable Indemnified Entities for all costs or liabilities with respect to
such Claim, such settlement, compromise or consent shall be permitted
hereunder only with the written consent of the Indemnified Entity (whether or
not the Indemnified Entity is an actual or potential party to such Claim),
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If,
within thirty (30) days of receipt from an Indemnified Entity of any Claim
Notice with respect to a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Entity (A)
advises such Indemnified Entity in writing that the Indemnifying Entity does
not elect to defend and investigate such Claim, (B) is not entitled to assume
and control the defense or investigation of such Claim or (C) fails to make
such an election in writing, then (1) such Indemnified Entity may, at its
option, defend, investigate, settle or compromise, or consent to an entry of
judgment with respect to, such Claim; _provided_ that any such settlement,
compromise or consent shall be permitted hereunder only with the written
consent of the Indemnifying Entity (whether or not the Indemnifying Entity is
an actual or potential party to such Claim), which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (2) the Indemnifying Entity
may participate in (but not control) any such defense and investigation at its
sole cost and expense. Each Indemnified Entity shall make available to the
Indemnifying Entity all information available to such Indemnified Entity
relating to such Claim, except as may be prohibited by applicable Law,
including providing the Indemnifying Entity promptly (but in any event within
five (5) Business Days) after the Indemnified Entitys receipt thereof, with
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Entity relating any Claim by a Third Party. In addition, the
Parties shall render to each other such assistance as may reasonably be
requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense and investigation
of any such Claim. If the Indemnifying Entity elects to assume control of the
defense and investigation of any such Claim, then the Indemnified Entity shall
be entitled to participate in (but not control) such defense and investigation
with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Entity at such
Indemnified Entitys sole cost and expense. In the event the Indemnifying
Entity assumes control of the defense and investigation of (or otherwise
elects to negotiate a settlement or compromise of or consent to an entry of
judgment with respect to) any such Claim, the Indemnified Entity shall
reimburse the Indemnifying Entity for all costs and expenses incurred by the
Indemnifying Entity in connection with such defense and investigation (or
negotiation, settlement, compromise or consent) to the extent, if applicable,
that such costs and expenses do not exceed the amount of the remaining
Deductible; _provided_ that such costs and expenses shall be included in the
calculation of the Deductible.

 



 

SECTION 8.04 _Indemnification Generally_.

 



 

(a) The amount of Indemnifiable Losses which the Indemnifying Entity is or may
be required to pay to any Indemnified Entity pursuant to this _Article 8_
shall be reduced without duplication (retroactively, if necessary) (i) by any
insurance proceeds or other amounts received or recoverable by or on behalf of
such Indemnified Entity or its Affiliates related to such Indemnifiable
Losses, (ii) any Tax benefit actually realized by such Indemnified Entity or

 



      
 

 



 

its Affiliates as a result of such Indemnifiable Losses, and (iii) to the
extent any such Indemnifiable Loss is reserved for in the Financial Statements
(including the notes thereto). An Indemnified Entity shall take, or cause its
Affiliates to take, all necessary and appropriate actions to pursue payment
from any Third Party with respect to any Indemnifiable Loss under any
Contract, arrangement or commitment pursuant to which such Indemnified Entity
or its Affiliates are entitled to reimbursement or indemnification with
respect to such Indemnifiable Loss. If an Indemnified Entity shall have
received the payment required by this Agreement from the Indemnifying Entity
in respect of Indemnifiable Losses and shall subsequently receive (or any of
its Affiliates shall subsequently receive) any insurance proceeds or other
amounts or shall subsequently realize (or any of its Affiliates shall
subsequently realize) any Tax benefit in respect of such Indemnifiable Losses,
then such Indemnified Entity shall promptly repay, or cause to be repaid, to
the Indemnifying Entity a sum equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds
or other amounts actually received or such Tax benefit actually realized. For
purposes of this _Section 8.04(a)_, a Tax benefit will be deemed to be
realized by an Indemnified Entity with respect to an Indemnifiable Loss in a
taxable period if, and to the extent that, either (A) the Indemnified Entity
or any of its Affiliates (including Purchaser) receives a refund or other
return of Taxes paid that would not have been received but for any Tax losses
or deductions attributable to such Indemnifiable Loss (treating such Tax
losses or deductions as the last item claimed for any taxable period), or (B)
the Indemnified Entitys or any of its Affiliates (including Purchasers)
cumulative liability for Taxes for such taxable period, calculated by
excluding the relevant Tax losses or deductions attributable to such
Indemnifiable Loss, exceeds the Indemnified Partys or any of its Affiliates
actual liability for Taxes for such taxable period, calculated by taking into
account the relevant Tax losses or deductions attributable to such
Indemnifiable Loss (treating such Tax losses or deductions as the last item
claimed for any taxable period).

 



 

(b) In addition to the requirements of _Section 8.04(a)_, each Indemnified
Entity shall be obligated in connection with any Claim for indemnification
under this _Article 8_ to take all necessary and appropriate actions (or
cease taking actions) to mitigate Indemnifiable Losses upon and after becoming
aware of any fact or circumstance that may give rise to such Indemnifiable
Losses. In the event an Indemnified Entity fails to take such actions, such
Indemnifying Entity shall have no liability for any portion of such
Indemnifiable Losses that reasonably could have been avoided had such
Indemnified Entity taken such actions.

 



 

(c) Subject to the rights of any Person providing insurance as contemplated by
_Section 8.04(a)_, the Indemnifying Entity shall be subrogated to any right,
defense or Claim that the Indemnified Entity may have against any other Person
with respect to any matter giving rise to a Claim for indemnification
hereunder. Such Indemnified Entity shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Entity in a reasonable manner, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Entity, in presenting any subrogated right, defense or Claim.

 



 

(d) Except as expressly provided in this _Article 8_, including _Section
8.01_ and _Section 8.02_, after the Tier Two Closing, no Party shall have any
liability to another Party, including with respect to any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement or
otherwise, under this Agreement or in respect of the transactions contemplated
hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, (i) each Indemnified Purchaser Entity
hereby waives, from and after the Tier Two Closing, any and all rights and
Claims it may have against the

 



      
 

 



 

Sellers arising under or based upon this Agreement, any document or
certificate delivered in connection herewith, any applicable Law (including
any applicable Environmental Law) or otherwise (except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article 8_), and (ii) the
Parties agree that no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in this Agreement, individually or in the aggregate, shall give rise
to any right on the part of any Party to rescind this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) All Indemnifiable Losses shall be determined without duplication of
recovery under other provisions of this Agreement or any other document or
agreement delivered in connection with this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the prior sentence, if a set of facts, conditions or events
constitutes a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of this Agreement that is subject to an indemnification obligation
under this _Article 8_, only one recovery of Indemnifiable Losses shall be
allowed with respect to such set of facts, conditions or events, and in no
event shall there be any indemnification or duplication of payments or
recovery under different provisions of this Agreement arising out of the same
set of facts, conditions or events.

 



 

(f) The Sellers shall not have any liability for any Indemnifiable Losses that
represent the cost of repairs, replacements or improvements to the extent that
such repairs, replacements or improvements enhance the value of the repaired,
replaced or improved asset or property above its value on the applicable
Closing Date or which represent the cost of repair or replacement exceeding
the lowest reasonable cost of repair or replacement.

 



 

(g) In no event shall the Sellers have any liability for any Indemnifiable
Losses to the extent that such Indemnifiable Losses are caused by or
exacerbated by any action or omission by any of the Indemnified Purchaser
Entities following the Tier One Closing.

 



 

(h) Neither Party shall have any right to off-set or set-off any payment due
pursuant to this _Article 8_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
Indemnifying Party shall have any liability for Indemnifiable Losses if an
Indemnified Entity had knowledge, as of the date hereof and at any time during
the Interim Period, of any fact or circumstance that, with or without notice
or the passage of time, would reasonably be expected to give such Indemnified
Entity the right to seek any remedy against such Indemnifying Party under this
_Article 8_.

 



 

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall any Indemnifying Entitys liability for Indemnifiable Losses with
respect to any Non-Wholly Owned Acquired Company exceed an amount equal to
such Indemnifying Partys pro rata share of such Non-Wholly Owned Acquired
Company as determined by reference to such Indemnifying Entitys ownership
interest in such Non-Wholly Owned Acquired Company at the relevant time and
the applicable allocation provisions of the Organizational Documents governing
such Non-Wholly Owned Acquired Company at the relevant time.

 



      
 

 



 

(k) All indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by
the Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by Law.

 



 

ARTICLE 9 _

SECTION 9.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated:

 



 

(a) at any time prior to the Tier One Closing Date by mutual written agreement

_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
9.01(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Tier One Closing to occur on or before such date;

 



 

(c) by either the Purchaser or the Sellers by giving written notice to the

prohibiting the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and such order, decree, ruling, other action or Law shall not be subject to
appeal or shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.01(c)_ shall not be
available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, such order, decree, ruling or
other action;

 



 

(d) by either the Purchaser or the Sellers by giving written notice to the
other Party if there has been a breach by such other Party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement and such breach (i) would result in the failure to satisfy one or
more of the conditions to the applicable Closing of the Party sending such
notice (set forth in _Section 6.01_, _Section 6.02_ or _Section 6.03_, as
applicable) and (ii) is of a character that is capable of being cured but has

days after the delivery by the Sellers of a Schedule Update if such Schedule
Update discloses a fact, circumstance, development, event or occurrence, the
existence of which, if not included in such Schedule Update, would have
otherwise permitted the Purchaser to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.01(d)_ (with or without giving effect to any cure period contained
in _Section 9.01(d)_); _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Purchaser does
not exercise its termination right under this _Section 9.01(e)_ within such
ten (10) day period, (i) the Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement as a result of any fact, circumstance, development, event or
occurrence disclosed in such Schedule Update and (ii) the Purchaser shall be
deemed to have irrevocably and forever waived any termination right or any
right to assert the failure to satisfy any condition to the applicable Closing
set forth in _Article 6_ with respect to any such fact, circumstance,
development, event or occurrence; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Purchaser
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement if the Purchaser is then in

Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) all representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement are contractual in nature only, (b) no
Person is asserting the truth or accuracy of any representation or warranty
set forth in this Agreement, (c) if any such representation or warranty (as
modified by the Sellers Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule, as applicable) should prove untrue or inaccurate, the applicable
Partys only rights, Claims or causes of action shall be to exercise the
specific rights set forth in _Section 6.02(b)_, _Section 6.03(b)_ and
_Section 9.01(d)_, as and if applicable, and (d) the Parties shall have no
other rights, Claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law or by statute) or in
equity) based on, arising out of or related to any such untruth or inaccuracy
of any such representation or warranty.

 



 

SECTION 10.04 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable
for any reason shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the
extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or
provision is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated
to the greatest extent possible. If any provision of this Agreement is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be so broad as to be
unenforceable, that provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

 



 

SECTION 10.05 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
shall, taken together, be considered one and the same agreement. Delivery of
an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic
image scan transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 10.06 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by the Purchaser and each Seller.
Each Party may, by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party,
waive compliance by any other Party with any term or provision of this
Agreement that such other Party was or is obligated to comply with or perform.
No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law.

 



 

SECTION 10.07 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
and the Other Transaction Documents (together with the written agreements,
Schedules and certificates referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto)
constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. Except as provided in _Section 7.03(a)_ or _Article
8_, this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns
and is not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
hereunder.

 



 

SECTION 10.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all Claims or causes of
action of the Parties (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether
at law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity) that may be based
on, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution,
performance or subject matter hereof, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

SECTION 10.09 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or was otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties
agrees that any other Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is
entitled at law or in equity. The Parties hereby waive, in any action for
specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and the
posting of any bond or other undertaking or security in connection therewith.
Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
there is adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each Party further agrees
that (i) by seeking any remedy provided in this _Article 10_, a Party shall
not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may
be available to a Party under this Agreement and (ii) nothing contained in
this _Section 10.09_ shall require any Party to institute any action for (or
limit any Partys right to institute any action for) specific performance
under this _Section 10.09_ before exercising any other right under this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties
expressly agree that the Seller shall be entitled to seek specific performance
of the Purchasers obligation to consummate the Tier One Closing if all of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.01_ and _Section 6.02_ have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closings), as applicable, and the Purchaser fails to
consummate the Tier One Closing by the date that the Tier One Closing is
required to have been consummated pursuant to _Section 2.03_.

 



 

(b) If any Party brings any Claim to enforce specifically the performance of
the terms and provisions when expressly available to such Party pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended
by the time period between the commencement of such Claim and the date on
which such Claim is fully and final resolved.

 



 

SECTION 10.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the
Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery or, if such court disclaims jurisdiction, any federal court
located in the State of Delaware, for the purposes of any suit, action or
other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
hereby. Each of the Parties further agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. certified mail to such Partys respective
address set forth in _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _10.02_ shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or
proceeding in the State of Delaware with respect to any matters to which it
has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding
sentence. Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in (a) the Delaware
Court of Chancery or (b) any federal court located in the State of Delaware,
and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to
plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. **EACH OF
THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.**

 



 

SECTION 10.11 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ that the Purchaser may
transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement, or its rights and
obligations related to a specific Sale, to an affiliated partnership, limited
liability company or corporation for purposes of having such partnership,
limited liability company or corporation take ownership of the Transferred
Interests, or the Transferred Interests subject to such specific Sale, and,
following transfer of all of the Purchasers rights and obligations under this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall be fully released and discharged from all
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any attempted assignment in
violation of the terms of this _Section 10.11_ shall be null and void, _ab
initio_.

 



 

SECTION 10.12 _Schedules, Annexes and Exhibits_. Except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, all Schedules, Annexes and Exhibits referred to herein are
intended to be and hereby are made a part of this Agreement. Any disclosure in
the Schedules corresponding to and qualifying a specific section or subsection
hereof shall be deemed to correspond to and qualify any other section or
subsection hereof relating to the Sellers or the Acquired Companies (in the
case of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule) or the Purchaser (in the case of the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule). Certain information set forth on the Schedules
is included solely for informational purposes, is not an admission of
liability with respect to the matters covered by the information, and may not
be required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. The specification of
any dollar amount contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific
item in the Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts (or higher or
lower amounts) are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the
setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the
Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in a Schedule is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. In no event will the
listing of any matter in the Schedules be deemed or interpreted to broaden or
otherwise amplify the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 10.13 _Acknowledgement and Waiver_.

 



 

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that the Sellers have retained
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP (" _Skadden_ ") to act as its counsel
in connection with

 



      
 

 



 

the transactions contemplated hereby and that Skadden has not acted as counsel
for any other Person in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
for conflict of interest or any other purposes. The Purchaser agrees that any
attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence attaching
as a result of Skaddens representation of the Sellers related to the
preparation for, and negotiation and consummation of, the transactions
contemplated hereby, including all communications among Skadden and the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates in preparation for, and negotiation
and consummation of, the transactions contemplated, shall survive the Tier Two
Closing and shall remain in effect. Furthermore, effective as of the Tier Two
Closing, all communications (and materials relating thereto) between the
Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and Skadden or any other legal counsel or
financial advisor, on the other hand, related to the preparation for, and
negotiation and consummation of, the transactions contemplated hereby are
hereby assigned and transferred to the Sellers.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser agrees that, notwithstanding any current or prior
representation of the Acquired Companies by Skadden, Skadden shall be allowed
to represent the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates in any matters
and disputes adverse to the Purchaser and/or the Acquired Companies that
either is existing on the date hereof or arises in the future and relates to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; and the Purchaser
hereby waives any conflicts or claim of privilege that may arise in connection
with such representation. Further, the Purchaser agrees that, in the event
that a dispute arises after the applicable Closing between the Purchaser or
the Acquired Companies and the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates,
Skadden may represent the Sellers or their respective Affiliate in such
dispute even though the interests of the Sellers or their respective Affiliate
may be directly adverse to the Purchaser or the Acquired Companies and even
though Skadden may have represented the Purchaser or the Acquired Companies in
a matter substantially related to such dispute.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser acknowledges that any advice given to or communication with
the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies) shall not be subject to any joint privilege and shall be owned
solely by the Sellers or their respective Affiliates. The Purchaser hereby
acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to discuss and obtain adequate
information concerning the significance and material risks of, and reasonable
available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other provisions of
this Agreement, including the opportunity to consult with counsel other than
Skadden.
