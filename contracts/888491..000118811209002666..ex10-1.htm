("CapitalSource"), CSE SLB LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("CSE
SLB"), and Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the

respective meanings ascribed to them in  Section 13 hereof. CapitalSource and
CSE SLB are collectively referred to herein as the "Sellers."

 

 

R E C I T A L S:

 

 

WHEREAS, CSE SLB owns 100% of the membership interests (the "Casablanca
Units") of CSE Casablanca Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Casablanca Holdings"), which in turn owns, through various direct and
indirect subsidiaries (the "Casablanca Subsidiaries"), the various healthcare
properties identified by the physical addresses listed on Schedule I hereto
(each a "Casablanca Property" and collectively, the "Casablanca Properties");
and

 

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Securities Purchase Agreement (the
"Purchase Agreement") dated as of November 17, 2009, by and among Buyer, the
Sellers and the other parties identified on the signature pages thereto,
Buyer has purchased from the Sellers an option to acquire the Casablanca
Units on the terms and conditions set forth therein and herein.

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein
contained, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereto, each intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

 

 

 

SECTION 1. GRANT OF OPTION

 

 

 

Subject to the terms and conditions of, and on the basis of and in reliance
upon the covenants, agreements and representations and warranties set forth
in, this Option Agreement, (i) for and in consideration of the
Casablanca Option Price, Sellers hereby grant to Buyer the exclusive option
(but not the obligation) to purchase and acquire at any time during the
Option Period the Casablanca Units on the terms and conditions set forth
herein (the "Casablanca Option"); and (ii) in the event Buyer elects
to exercise the Casablanca Option as set forth in Section 3 hereof, then,
Sellers, as applicable, shall sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to
the Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase and acquire from such Sellers, free
and clear of all Encumbrances except for Permitted Securities Encumbrances,
the Casablanca Units.

 

 

 

SECTION 2. PURCHASE AND SALE OF OPTION AND CASABLANCA UNITS

 

 

 

 

2.1 Purchase Price for Casablanca Option.

 

 

 

The aggregate consideration for the purchase of the Casablanca Option payable
by Buyer to Seller on the date hereof in accordance with Section 2.1 of the
Purchase Agreement, is $25,000,000 (the "Casablanca Option Price"), which
such Casablanca Option Price is payable in the form of a number of shares of
Buyer Common Stock (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) calculated pursuant
to Section 2.1(b) of the Purchase Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.2 Purchase Price For Casablanca Units.

 

 

 

(a) In the event Buyer elects to exercise the Casablanca Option,
the aggregate purchase price for the Casablanca Units payable by the Buyer
to Sellers shall be $295,210,829 (the "Base Purchase Price"), consisting of:

 

 

(i) an amount in cash equal to $30,510,829 (the "Initial Cash Consideration"),
increased or decreased in accordance with Sections 2.2(b), 2.2(c), 2.3 and,
if applicable, 6.17 (such adjusted Initial Cash Consideration, the "Cash
Consideration" and such adjustments, the "Closing Adjustments");

 

 

(ii) $264,700,000 of Indebtedness of the Casablanca Subsidiaries assumed or
paid off by the Buyer, which such Indebtedness shall be designated in
a certificate delivered from Sellers no later than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date (the "Assumed Indebtedness").

 

 

The Base Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to this Option Agreement is
referred to as the "Final Purchase Price." The allocation of the
Final Purchase Price among the Casablanca Properties is set forth on Schedule
2.1(a) of the Purchase Agreement. The Cash Consideration shall be paid to
Sellers or their Affiliates as directed by Sellers in a notice delivered no
less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing.

 

 

(b) In the event that any of the Casablanca Subsidiaries or
Casablanca Properties are sold between the date hereof and the Closing Date,
the Initial Cash Consideration shall be reduced by the greater of (i) the net
proceeds of such sale or (ii) the purchase price allocated to such Casablanca
Property on Schedule 2.1(a) to the Purchase Agreement; provided, however,
that there shall be no reduction in the Initial Cash Consideration with
respect to a sale of CSE Pittsburg or the Pittsburg Facility.

 

 

(c) On the Closing Date, the Initial Cash Consideration shall be
(i) increased, dollar-for-dollar, to the extent the aggregate principal
amount of Assumed Indebtedness is less than $264,700,000 or (ii)
decreased, dollar-for-dollar, to the extent the aggregate principal amount of
Assumed Indebtedness is greater than $264,700,000.

 

 

(d) [Intentionally left blank]

 

 

(e) Tax Treatment of the Purchase and Sale of Casablanca Units. Solely for
U.S. federal Income Tax purposes, the Buyer and each Seller, as applicable,
shall treat the purchase and sale of the Casablanca Units pursuant to Buyer's
exercise of the Casablanca Option under this Option Agreement as a purchase
and sale of each of the Casablanca Properties and other assets owned by the
Casablanca Subsidiaries. The purchase price for Income Tax purposes of the
Casablanca Properties and other assets shall equal the Final Purchase Price
(plus the Casablanca Option Price and any other items constituting
consideration for purposes of Section 1060 of the Code). The allocation of
such purchase price to the Casablanca Properties and other assets of the
Casablanca Subsidiaries shall be agreed to by the Buyer and Sellers within
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date. The Buyer and Sellers and each of
their respective Affiliates shall take all actions and properly and timely
file all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, IRS Form 8594 (Asset
Acquisition Statement) consistent with such allocation). None of the Sellers
or the Buyer shall take any position for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes
(whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the
allocation unless required to do so by applicable Law. In the event that any
Tax authority disputes such allocation, Sellers or the Buyer, as the case may
be, shall promptly notify the other party of the nature of such dispute.

2.3 Additional Adjustments and Apportionments.

 

 

 

(a) Sellers and the Buyer hereby acknowledge and agree that, as of
the Closing Date: (i) certain costs and expenses, including any
Taxes (franchise, income or other), relating to the Casablanca Subsidiaries
and the Casablanca Properties, (A) may have accrued during and be applicable
for the period ending at 12:01 a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date (such
period, the "Pre-Closing Period") but will not have been paid by Sellers or
the applicable Casablanca Subsidiary prior to the end of the Pre-
Closing Period (such accrued expenses, if any, that are unpaid as of the end
of the Pre-Closing Period being hereinafter referred to as "Accrued
Expenses") or (B) will not accrue until, or may be applicable for, the period
after 12:01 a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing
Period") but will have been paid by Sellers or one or more of the applicable
Casablanca Subsidiaries prior to the beginning of the Post-Closing Period
(such unaccrued expenses, if any, that have been prepaid as of the beginning
of the Post-Closing Period being hereinafter referred to as "Prepaid
Expenses"); and (ii) certain items of income and revenue relating to the
Casablanca Subsidiaries and the Casablanca Properties, including, without
limitation, rental income (excluding Past Due Rent), (A) may have accrued
during or be applicable for the Pre-Closing Period but will not have been
paid during the Pre-Closing Period (such accrued income, revenue and other
amounts, if any, that are unpaid as of the end of the Pre-Closing Period, the
"Accrued Income") or (B) will not accrue until, or may be applicable for, the
Post-Closing Period but will have been paid prior to the Post-Closing Period
(such unaccrued income, revenue and other amounts, if any, that has been
prepaid as of the beginning of the Post-Closing Period being hereinafter
referred to as "Prepaid Income"). Subject to the other provisions herein
contained, the Accrued Expenses, Prepaid Expenses, Accrued Income and Prepaid
Income shall be apportioned (on the basis of a 365 day year) to Sellers with
respect to the Pre-Closing Period and the Buyer with respect to the Post-
Closing Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Accrued Income" shall exclude
any rent as to which the Tenant is fifteen (15) days or more past due as of
the Closing Date ("Past Due Rent"), and "Accrued Expenses" shall exclude any
accrued, but unpaid costs or expenses for which a Tenant is obligated to
reimburse any of the Casablanca Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of a
Property Lease; provided, however, that in the event a Tenant is, as of the
Closing Date, in default of (and all applicable cure periods have expired),
or disputing any obligation to pay such costs or expenses, the amount thereof
shall be payable by Sellers for purposes of calculating the apportionments
contemplated by this Section 2.3(a). Subsequent to the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the terms
of the applicable Property Lease and shall remit to Sellers the amount of any
such defaulted or disputed costs and expenses together with any Past Due
Rent actually collected by the Buyer less all fees and expenses incurred by
the Buyer in collecting such monies. In addition to the foregoing, any
deposits reflected on Schedule 4.6(e) of the Disclosure Schedule held by
Sellers or any of the Casablanca Subsidiaries (excluding any amounts set
forth on Schedule 2.3(c)), will be paid (if not already held in an account of
the Casablanca Subsidiaries) over to the Buyer on the Closing Date
or contributed to the Casablanca Subsidiaries on or prior to the
Closing Date.

(b) Not later than ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall
prepare and deliver to the Buyer a written statement setting forth, as of the
Closing Date, a reasonably detailed good faith calculation of the
Accrued Expenses, Prepaid Expenses, Accrued Income and Prepaid Income for
each of the Casablanca Subsidiaries and Casablanca Properties. The Buyer
shall have the right to review such written statement and shall notify
Sellers of any objection thereto within three Business Days after the
receipt thereof. Sellers and the Buyer shall negotiate in good faith
to attempt to resolve any objection made by the Buyer, provided that if the
parties are unable to agree upon a reasonably detailed calculation of such
amounts at least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer and
Sellers shall promptly cause, an independent accountant to be mutually agreed
upon by the Buyer and Sellers (the "Independent Accountant"), to review this
Option Agreement and the disputed amounts for the purposes of calculating
such disputed amounts (it being understood that in making such calculation,
the Independent Accountant shall be functioning as an expert and not as an
arbitrator). In making such calculation, the Independent Accountant shall
consider only those amounts in the Sellers' calculation of the Accrued
Expenses, Prepaid Expenses, Accrued Income and Prepaid Income as to which
Buyer has disagreed. The Independent Accountant shall deliver to the Buyer
and Sellers, as promptly as practicable, a report setting forth its
estimation of each disputed amount. The fees and expenses of any such
Independent Accountant shall be shared equally between the Buyer
and CapitalSource. If the Buyer does not notify Sellers of any
objection within such three Business Day period, the Buyer shall be deemed to
have agreed with the apportionments specified in Sellers' written statement.
If, after the Closing, an error or omission in the calculation of the
Accrued Expenses, Prepaid Expenses, Accrued Income or Prepaid Income is found
by one of the parties hereto, such error or omission shall be promptly
corrected, and the party hereto who received any over-payment as a result
thereof shall pay the amount of such over-payment in cash to the party hereto
entitled thereto; provided, however, that such obligation to correct
apportionments shall only survive the Closing for a period of 365 days;
provided, further, that any disagreement with respect to such calculation
shall be resolved pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Section
 2.3 (b).

 

 

(c) The Initial Cash Consideration shall be (i) (A) reduced by the excess, if
any, of the aggregate amount of Accrued Expenses over the aggregate amount of
Prepaid Expenses and (B) increased by the excess, if any, of the aggregate
amount of Prepaid Expenses over the aggregate amount of Accrued Expenses, and
(ii) (A) reduced by the excess, if any, of the aggregate amount of Prepaid
Income over the aggregate amount of Accrued Income and (B) increased by the
excess, if any, of the aggregate amount of Accrued Income over the aggregate
amount of Prepaid Income, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (i)
and (ii), as such amounts are mutually agreed or finally resolved in
accordance with Section  2.3 (b). In addition, the Initial
Cash Consideration shall be increased by the amounts held by third parties as
of the Closing Date with respect to all amounts related to the matters set
forth on Schedule  2.3 (c) hereof as set forth in a certificate delivered
from Sellers to the Buyer no less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.4 Payments and Computations.

 

 

 

All cash payments to be made under this Option Agreement by any party hereto
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
or accounts designated by the party receiving such payment. All computations
of interest with respect to any amounts due from or to either party hereto
pursuant to this Option Agreement will be made on the basis of a year of 365
days, in each case for the actual number of days (excluding the first day,
but including the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest
is payable.

At any time during the Option Period, Buyer may exercise the Casablanca

6.3 Consents and Cooperation.

 

 

 

Prior to the Closing, Sellers and the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all Seller Consents (as defined in the Purchase Agreement)
and Buyer Consents, respectively. Without limiting, and in furtherance of,
the foregoing, prior to the Closing, the Buyer will submit appropriate
licensure applications for a change of ownership for the Casablanca
Subsidiaries with the appropriate state licensure authorities and provide
notice of any such submissions to the Sellers concurrently with the making of
such submissions. Each of Sellers and the Buyer shall reasonably assist and
cooperate with the other in preparing and filing all documents required to be
submitted by the Buyer or the Sellers to any Governmental Entity in
connection with such transactions and in obtaining any relevant
Seller Consents and Buyer Consents (which assistance and cooperation shall
include, without limitation, the timely furnishing to the Buyer or Sellers,
as applicable, of all information concerning Buyer or Sellers or any
Casablanca Subsidiary that counsel to the Buyer determines is required to be
included in such documents or would be helpful in obtaining any such Buyer
Consents and Seller Consents). Each of the parties hereto shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as
may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. In connection
therewith, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted challenging the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents as violative of any applicable Law, each of the parties hereto
shall cooperate and use all commercially reasonable efforts to contest and
resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed,
or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent (each an "Order"), that is in effect and
that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of such transactions,
unless by mutual agreement the Buyer and Sellers decide that litigation is
not in their respective best interests. The Buyer and Sellers shall each use
all commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to
cause the expiration of the notice periods under the applicable Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents as
promptly as possible after the execution of this Option Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) none of the Buyer, any
of its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate thereof shall (a) be required to divest
any of its or its Subsidiaries' or Affiliates' businesses or assets, (b) to
take or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation that could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or a material
adverse effect on the Buyer, any of its Subsidiaries or any Affiliates
thereof or the Casablanca Subsidiaries (or any of them) from and after the
Closing Date or (c) take any action involving more than nominal expense, cost
or burden prior to the delivery of an Exercise Notice and (ii) none of
Sellers or any Affiliate thereof shall (x) be required to divest any of their
respective businesses, or assets, or (y) to take or agree to take any other
action or agree to any limitation that could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Casablanca Subsidiaries or a material adverse
effect on any of its Subsidiaries or any Affiliates thereof or any Seller or
any of their respective Affiliates from and after the Closing Date. Without
limiting, and in furtherance of, the foregoing, Sellers shall, and shall
cause each Casablanca Subsidiary to, fully cooperate with the Buyer in
connection with the Buyer obtaining title policies (and
customary endorsements thereto), surveys, zoning reports or certificates and
any other property-level inquiries or undertakings sought by the Buyer with
respect to the Casablanca Properties, and Sellers shall, and shall cause each
Casablanca Subsidiary to, subject to the last sentence of Section  6.2 (a),
grant access to the Casablanca Properties and execute and deliver any
certificates or affidavits reasonably requested in connection therewith
(including any title affidavit and indemnity relating to customary non-
imputation endorsements) at or prior to Closing.

6.4 No Solicitation.

 

 

 

During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the Termination
Date, except for the matters set forth on Schedule  6.1 (b):

 

 

(a) Neither any Seller, any Casablanca Subsidiary nor any of its or their
respective Affiliates shall, and each of the foregoing shall not allow
any Person acting on its behalf to, directly or indirectly, continue,
initiate, encourage, solicit or participate in discussions or negotiations
with, or provide any nonpublic information to, any Person (other than the
Buyer and its representatives in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Option Agreement or the other Transaction Documents)
concerning (i) any sale of assets of any Casablanca Subsidiary (other than in
the ordinary course of its business and consistent with past practice), (ii)
any sale of any securities of any Casablanca Subsidiary including, without
limitation, the Casablanca Units, (iii) any other transaction including,
without limitation, a merger, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation or
similar transaction, directly involving any Casablanca Subsidiary
(collectively, an "Acquisition Transaction") or (iv) enter into
any agreement, understanding or arrangement with respect to an
Acquisition Transaction. In addition to the foregoing, no Seller shall agree
to engage in any Acquisition Transaction unless the terms thereof expressly
exclude the Casablanca Subsidiaries and the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents. Sellers shall advise their financial advisors of
Sellers' obligations pursuant to this Section  6.4 and instruct such
advisors not to take any action in contravention hereof.

 

 

(b) Sellers shall, and each of them, shall cause each Casablanca Subsidiary
to, promptly communicate to the Buyer within three (3) Business
Days following receipt the terms of any proposal that any of its officers
or directors or Persons serving similar capacities may receive after the date
of this Option Agreement in respect of an Acquisition Transaction.
Any notification under this Section  6.4 (b) shall include the identity of
each Person making such proposal, the terms of such proposal and any other
information with respect thereto as the Buyer may reasonably request.

 

 

(c) Sellers hereby agree that a monetary remedy for a breach of
the agreements set forth in this Section  6.4 will be inadequate and
impracticable, and that any such breach would cause the Buyer and its
Affiliates irreparable harm. In the event of a breach of this Section  6.4,
in addition to any other remedies available to the Buyer, without the
requirement of posting any bond or other security, the Buyer shall be
entitled to seek equitable remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction
regarding this Section  6.4, including, without limitation, the equitable
remedy of specific performance with respect to the provisions of this Section
 6.4, and shall be entitled to such injunctive relief, including temporary
restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions, as a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine with respect to any such
breach of the agreements set forth in this Section  6.4; provided, however,
that, in the event that the Buyer terminates this Option Agreement pursuant
to Section  1.1(e), the Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy in respect of such
termination (including any breach by Sellers, any Casablanca Subsidiary or
any of their respective Affiliates of the agreements set forth in this Section
 6.4) shall be to pursue an action against Sellers for Damages as provided
in Section 10.2, and neither any Seller, any Casablanca Subsidiary nor any of
their respective Affiliates shall have any further obligations or liabilities
under this Option Agreement except as otherwise provided in Section 10.2.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, any breach by a Seller, any
Casablanca Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates of any provision
of Section  6.4(a) that is not cured within five (5) Business Days shall
be deemed to be a material breach of this Option Agreement and, for purposes
of the exercise by the Buyer of its termination rights pursuant to Section
10.1(e), after such cure period such breach shall be deemed incapable of
being cured prior to the Termination Date.

 

 

 

6.5 Disclosure Schedule.

 

 

 

Not less than five business days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall
deliver to the Buyer updated Disclosure Schedules and the Buyer shall deliver
to Sellers disclosure schedules relating to the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 5 (the "Buyer Disclosure Schedules" and,
collectively, the "Updated Disclosure Schedule") solely for
informational purposes, specifying material changes to the
Disclosure Schedules. Subject to the provisions set forth in the
Updated Disclosure Schedule, each exception set forth in the Updated
Disclosure Schedule and each other disclosure and response to this Option
Agreement set forth in the Updated Disclosure Schedule shall be in reasonable
detail and identified by reference to, or shall be grouped under a heading
referring to, a specific individual section or subsection (as applicable) of
this Option Agreement. The inclusion of any information in the Updated
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgement, in
and of itself or solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in the
Updated Disclosure Schedule, that such information is required to be set
forth therein or that such information is material to Sellers, any Casablanca
Subsidiary, the Buyer or their respective business, assets or liabilities.
Any item disclosed on any section in the Updated Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed with respect to all other sections under which such
item may be relevant to the extent that such section is reasonably cross-
referenced or the relevance to such other section is readily apparent on the
face of the disclosure. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in
the Updated Disclosure Schedule shall have the respective meanings ascribed
to them in this Option Agreement.

 

 

 

6.6 Notices of Certain Events.

 

 

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, or expiration of the Option
Period, Sellers shall, promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business
Days, after obtaining Knowledge of any of the following, notify the Buyer, in
writing, of: (i) any notice or communication to any Seller from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Option Agreement; (ii) any notice or other
communication to any Seller from any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Option Agreement; (iii) (A) any fact or
condition that causes or constitutes a breach of any of the

Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section  7.2 would not be
satisfied and (B) any changes or events which have had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or otherwise result in any
representation or warranty of any Seller being materially inaccurate as of
the date of such changes or events such that the condition set forth in
Section  7.2 would not be satisfied; and (iv) the occurrence of any default
or event of default under any Property Lease and the exercise (or receipt of
notice of intent to exercise) by any Tenant of any renewal option contained
in any Property Lease.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, or expiration of the Option
Period, Buyer shall, promptly, and in any event within five (5)

Sellers, in writing, of: (i) any notice or communication to Buyer from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Option Agreement; (ii) any notice

Buyer being materially inaccurate as of the date of such changes or events
such that the condition set forth in Section  8.2 would not be satisfied.

 

 

 

6.7 Seller Releases.

 

 

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, in consideration of the
mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, including the consideration
to be received by Sellers, each Seller, in its capacity as a selling
equityholder, hereby irrevocably releases and forever discharges each
Casablanca Subsidiary (for the benefit of each such Casablanca Subsidiary and
the Buyer and their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, and predecessors and
their respective past and present managers, directors, officers, employees
and agents, and each of their respective successors, heirs, assigns,
executors and administrators (collectively, the "Released Persons")) of and

rights, debts, dues, sums of money, accounts, bonds, bills, covenants,
Contracts, controversies, omissions, promises, variances, trespasses,
damages, liabilities, judgments, executions, claims and demands whatsoever,
in law or in equity against the Released Persons which each Seller ever had,
now has or which it hereafter can, shall or may have, whether known or
unknown, suspected or unsuspected, matured or unmatured, fixed or contingent,
for, upon or by reason of any matter or cause arising at any time on or prior
to the Closing Date; provided, however, that nothing herein shall operate to
release any obligation of any Casablanca Subsidiary or the Buyer under the
Transaction Documents or the Assumed Indebtedness. No Seller has assigned
any such claim set forth in this Section  6.7 (a).

 

 

(b) Each Seller hereby covenants not to sue or to institute or cause to be
instituted any action in any federal, state or local agency or any court
or other tribunal against the Released Persons that is related directly

for the Casablanca Properties for each interim period subsequent to December

statements, as permitted by the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")) and SEC Regulation S-X to the
extent applicable to acquired properties, applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto
and subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments) and shall fairly present, in accordance with the applicable
requirements of GAAP, the information set forth therein.

 

 

 

6.9 Public Announcements.

 

 

 

The parties shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Option Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Option Agreement and shall not issue

such consultation, except as may be required by Law or any listing agreement
with a national securities exchange or trading system to which any of the
parties is a party.

 

 

 

6.10  Confidentiality.

 

 

 

All confidential information obtained by the Buyer or any Seller
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Option Agreement
shall be kept confidential in accordance with (a) the confidentiality
agreement, dated October 9, 2009, by and between the Buyer and CapitalSource
and (b) the confidentiality agreement dated November 6, 2009, by and between
the Buyer and CapitalSource (collectively, the "Confidentiality Agreement").

 

 

 

6.11  Estoppel Certificates.

 

 

 

Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to the
Buyer an Estoppel Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit B to the
Purchase Agreement executed by each Tenant.

 

 

 

6.12  Intercreditor Arrangements.

 

 

 

With respect to any Tenant or Facility Operator of any Casablanca Property
set forth on Section 4.14(b) of the Disclosure Schedule that is a party
to any Seller/Tenant Indebtedness, Sellers (or the appropriate Affiliate
of Sellers) shall enter into an agreement at or before the Closing Date, in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit C to the Purchase Agreement (the
"Intercreditor Agreements"), pursuant to which Sellers (or such Affiliates)
agree, among other things, that any exercise of any rights or remedies
arising under, pursuant to or in connection with any such Contract, shall in
no way terminate, impair, alter, extinguish or otherwise affect the terms or
conditions of any Property Lease between any Casablanca Subsidiary and such
Tenant or Facility Operator.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6.13  Senior Loan Extension.

 

 

 

Sellers shall cause (i) each of the Casablanca Senior Loan Borrowers to
exercise its options to extend the maturity date of the Casablanca
Senior Loan for successive one-year periods, first to April 9, 2011, and then
to April 9, 2012, and (ii) CSE Casablanca Holdings II LLC to exercise its
options to extend the maturity date of the Casablanca Mezzanine Loan for
successive one-year periods, first to April 9, 2011, and then to April

extension notices given by or on behalf of the Casablanca Senior Loan
Borrowers and CSE Casablanca Holdings II LLC, respectively, promptly after
such notices are sent to the Casablanca Senior Lender and the Casablanca
Mezzanine Lender, as the case may be.

 

 

 

6.14 Title Searches; Title Commitments.

 

 

 

(a) Existing Title Policies. For any Casablanca Properties with respect to
which the applicable Casablanca Subsidiary is the named insured under an
existing policy of title insurance covering such Casablanca Property (an
"Insured Property"), as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of the
Exercise Notice, Sellers shall cause title searches (the "Title Searches")
covering the Casablanca Properties from the date the applicable Casablanca
Subsidiary acquired its interest in the applicable Insured Property through
the most recent date the applicable real estate records can be searched to be
issued by the title insurer, together with copies of all documents evidencing
the items referred to as exceptions in the Title Searches. Sellers shall be
obligated to cure any title encumbrances with respect to (i) deeds of trust,
mortgages, assignments of leases and rents, fixture filings and security
interests and encumbrances securing money borrowed from a financial
institution (such as a bank, savings and loan, insurance company, or the
like) securing obligations other than the Assumed Indebtedness, and (ii)
other liens that can be cured solely by the payment of a liquidated amount,
in each case from the closing proceeds payable to Sellers or otherwise.

 

 

(b) No Title Policy. For any Casablanca Properties with respect to which the
applicable Casablanca Subsidiary is not the named insured under an existing
policy of title insurance covering such Casablanca Property (an "Uninsured
Property"), as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Option
Agreement, Sellers shall cause title insurance commitments (the "Title
Commitments") covering the Uninsured Properties to be issued by a nationally
recognized title insurer reasonably acceptable to Buyer, committing the title
insurer to issue its current form of ALTA owner's or leasehold title
insurance policy to the Casablanca Subsidiary in the amount of the Final
Purchase Price allocated to each Uninsured Property (each a "Title Policy"),
together with copies of all documents evidencing the items referred to as
exceptions in the Title Commitments. Sellers shall be obligated to cure any
title encumbrances with respect to (i) deeds of trust, mortgages, assignments
of leases and rents, fixture filings and security interests and
encumbrances securing money borrowed from a financial institution (such as a
bank, savings and loan, insurance company, or the like) securing obligations
other than the Assumed Indebtedness, and (ii) other liens that can be cured
solely by the payment of a liquidated amount, in each case from the closing
proceeds payable to Sellers or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for
any Uninsured Property for which an affiliate of an Casablanca Subsidiary is
the insured under an existing policy of title insurance, Sellers shall be
permitted to obtain an endorsement to such title policy from the issuer
thereof changing the insured to the applicable Casablanca Subsidiary; upon
the issuance of such endorsement, such Casablanca Property shall thereafter
be an Insured Property for all purposes of this Agreement.

6.15  Seller Cooperation with Transaction Financing.

 

 

 

Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall provide, and shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their officers and employees to provide, on a
timely basis, all reasonable cooperation requested by the Buyer and that is
customary for sellers to provide in connection with the arrangement of the
financing to be incurred by the Buyer (the "Financing") in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (provided that such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Sellers),
including using its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) facilitate the
provision of guarantees and pledge of collateral (effective as of the Closing
Date), (ii) provide financial and other pertinent information regarding the
Casablanca Subsidiaries and the Casablanca Properties as may be reasonably
requested in writing by the Buyer, (iii) provide (to the extent not
previously provided) copies of the most recent appraisals, environmental
reports, evidence of title (including copies of deeds, lease documentation,
title insurance policies and/or commitments for title insurance, title
opinions, surveys, and similar information currently maintained on the data
site), and similar information as may be reasonably requested by the
Buyer with respect to the Casablanca Properties, and (iv) assist the Buyer
and its financing sources as may be reasonably requested in the preparation
of all agreements (including review of schedules for completeness) for the
Financing insofar as such materials relate to the properties to be acquired
by the Buyer, it being understood and agreed that information and documents
provided by Sellers may be delivered to agents and lenders (subject to
customary arrangements for confidentiality that are substantially similar to
the provisions in the Confidentiality Agreement or reasonably acceptable to
the Sellers); provided, however, that no certificate, document or instrument
referred to above shall be effective until the Closing Date, and none of the
Sellers (nor prior to the Closing Date, the Casablanca Subsidiaries) shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
liability or obligation in connection with the Financing. Buyer shall
promptly, upon request by the Sellers, reimburse Sellers for all out-of-
pocket costs (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the Sellers in
connection with the cooperation of Sellers contemplated by this Section
 6.15 and the Buyer. The Buyer shall promptly, upon request by
Sellers, reimburse Sellers for all out-of-pocket costs (including attorneys'
fees) incurred by Sellers or the Casablanca Subsidiaries in connection with
the cooperation of Sellers contemplated by this Section  6.15 and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and their respective directors, officers,
employees and representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing and any information used in connection
therewith. Any assumption of the Assumed Indebtedness, if any, shall be at
the sole cost and expense of the Buyer.

Casablanca Subsidiaries hereunder. The Buyer acknowledges that it is not
acquiring CSE Pittsburg nor the facility owned by CSE Pittsburg or any real
or personal property owned by CSE Pittsburg (collectively, the
"Pittsburg Facility").

 

 

(b) At any time subsequent to the date hereof, Sellers may (i) cause CSE
Pittsburg to convey the Pittsburg Facility to any Seller or their designees
or (ii) may cause Casablanca II to convey the membership interests in CSE
Pittsburg to any Seller or their designee, provided that, to the extent any
such conveyances are prior to the Closing Date, such conveyances shall only
be with the consent of the Casablanca Senior Lender and the Casablanca
Mezzanine Lender, to the extent required.

 

 

(c) In the event that, as of Closing, Casablanca II continues to own all of
the membership interests in CSE Pittsburg and CSE Pittsburg owns the
Pittsburg Facility, at Closing, at Sellers' option, CSE Pittsburg shall
convey the Pittsburg Facility to any Seller or their designee or Casablanca
II shall convey all of the membership interests in CSE Pittsburg to any
Seller or their designees. Such transfers shall occur immediately following
the Closing and Buyer shall execute all documents necessary or appropriate in
connection therewith, at Sellers' expense.

 

 

(d) In the event that the Pittsburg Facility is conveyed pursuant to the
foregoing Section 6.16(c), Buyer shall retain ownership of the membership
interests in CSE Pittsburg.

(a) Sellers, in their sole discretion, shall have the right to exclude the
Acquired Properties owned by the Casablanca Subsidiaries CSE Hillard LLC
("CSE Hilliard") and CSE Canton LLC ("CSE Canton") pursuant to the provisions
of this Section 6.17 from the Closing. In the event that Sellers elect to
exclude CSE Hilliard and CSE Canton from the Closing, the Final Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the amount of the purchase price allocated to CSE
Hilliard and CSE Canton on Schedule 2.1(a) of the Purchase Agreement, and the
condition to Closing set forth in Section 7.9 shall be deemed to have
been satisfied.

 

 

(b) In the event that Sellers elect to proceed under Section 6.17(a) above,
at Closing, at Sellers' option, CSE Hilliard shall convey the Acquired
Property owned by CSE Hilliard (the "Hilliard Property") and CSE Canton shall
convey the Acquired Property owned by CSE Canton (the "Canton Property") to
any Seller or their designee or Casablanca II shall convey all of the
membership interests in CSE Hilliard and CSE Canton to any Seller or their
designee. Such transfers shall occur immediately following the Closing and
Buyer shall execute all documents necessary or appropriate in connection
therewith, at Sellers' expense.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) In the event that the Hilliard Property and the Canton Property are
conveyed pursuant to the foregoing Section 6.17(b), Buyer shall retain

SECTION 6A TAX COVENANTS

 

 

The provisions of Section 6A (Tax Covenants) of the purchase agreement

The representations and warranties of Sellers contained in this Option
Agreement shall be true and correct at and as of the Closing Date in
all respects (without giving effect to any qualifiers relating to
"materiality," "Material Adverse Effect," "in all material respects" or
similar qualifications) as though such representations and warranties were
made at and as of the Closing Date, except for representations and warranties
made as of a specified date, which shall be true and correct in all respects
(without giving effect to any qualifiers relating to "materiality," "Material
Adverse Effect," "in all material respects" or similar qualifications) as of
the specified date, except in each case to the extent that the failure of any
such representations and warranties to be so true and correct as of such
times shall not have had a Material Adverse Effect on the Casablanca
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The Buyer shall have received from Sellers
certificates, each dated the Closing Date, to that effect signed on behalf of
each Seller by an authorized officer thereof.

 

 

 

7.3 Performance of Covenants.

 

 

 

Each Seller shall have performed or complied in all material respects with
all agreements and covenants required by this Option Agreement to be

The consents, approvals, notices and filings with any Governmental Entity or
other Person ("Consents") set forth on Schedule  7.5 shall have been
obtained in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and shall
be in full force and effect on the Closing Date.

7.7 Outstanding Indebtedness.

 

 

 

No Casablanca Subsidiary shall have any Indebtedness or otherwise be liable
for any Indebtedness other than the Assumed Indebtedness, and as
evidence thereof the Buyer shall have received (a) a certificate from an
officer of each Seller certifying the same with respect to each Casablanca
Subsidiary beneficially owned by such Seller and (b) confirmation from a
nationally recognized title insurance company that such title insurance

With respect to any Casablanca Property that is an Uninsured Property, a
nationally recognized title insurance company shall have issued or shall be
prepared to issue upon payment of the applicable premiums therefor, title
policies in customary form and substance and with endorsements
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer, including, without limitation,
comprehensive and zoning and non-imputation endorsement, to the extent
applicable. With respect to any Casablanca Property that is an Insured
Property, the issuer of the title insurance policy relating thereto shall
have issued or be prepared to issue upon payment of the applicable premiums
therefor, a so-called date down endorsement and a non-imputation endorsement
with respect to such Insured Property; provided, however, that Sellers, in
lieu of providing such endorsements, may provide, at their expense, a new
title insurance policy that satisfies the requirements of the first sentence
of this Section 7.8.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7.9 Replacement Leases for Canton and Hilliard.

 

 

 

(a) On or before the Closing Date, Sellers shall have entered into long-term
Property Leases for each of Arbors at Canton and Arbors at Hilliard with a
Tenant having a credit rating comparable to or better than that of
the current Tenant, which Property Leases shall provide for initial aggregate
annual rent of not less than $1,360,000 (the "Arbors Base Rent") with an
annual rent escalator of not less than 2.5%. In the event such Property
Leases establish a level of initial rent (the "Arbors Initial Rent") payable
at the commencement of the Property Leases (excluding any rent holidays) that
is less than the Arbors Base Rent, then the difference between the level of
Arbors Base Rent and Arbors Initial Rent shall be divided by 0.1032 (the "Cap
Rate") and the Base Purchase Price shall be decreased by the product so
obtained in the event the Arbors Initial Rent is less than the Arbors Base
Rent.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the adjustment contemplated by Section
7.9(a) result in a decrease in the Base Purchase Price, then in the event
that prior to the Closing Date Sellers enter into a new (or renewed) long-
term Property Lease for the two properties currently covered by the
Pinon master lease (the "Pinon Properties"), then the amount by which Arbors
Base Rent exceeds the Arbors Initial Rent shall be reduced, dollar-for-
dollar, by any increase in the annual rent relating to the Pinon Properties
in excess of $385,008. The amount by which Arbors Base Rent exceeds Arbors
Initial Rent, as adjusted pursuant to the preceding sentence, and multiplied
by the Cap Rate, will then reflect the total reduction in the Base
Purchase Price.

 

 

(c) Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer a certificate no less than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date setting forth in reasonable
detail the adjustments to the Base Purchase Price, if any, contemplated
by Sections 7.9(a) and (b).

 

 

 

7.10  Property Financial Statements.

of the following conditions:

 

 

 

8.1 Deliveries at Closing.

 

 

 

The Buyer shall have delivered, or caused to have been delivered, to Sellers
all items required pursuant to Section  9.3, it being acknowledged and

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Option Agreement,
upon the occurrence of any Clawback Trigger Event (as defined below) the

be in the form of either a return of the Stock Consideration or, in the event

Price within such ten day period, (a) the Buyer shall have the right to take
legal action (the "Enforcement Action") to enforce such refund (and so long
as any lawsuit to enforce the refund of the Option Price pursuant to this
Section 10.1 shall be pending, the expiration date of the Option Period shall
be extended one day for each day that such lawsuit is pending; provided,
however, that the Casablanca Option shall expire at 5:00 p.m. New York City
time on the third Business Day following the date on which the Option Price
is amount is refunded to the Buyer. Unless the Buyer shall have otherwise
expressly otherwise agreed in writing, so long as the Option Period shall not
have expired as hereinabove provided, the Casablanca Option shall survive any
dismissal with prejudice of an Enforcement Action or the entry by a court of
competent jurisdiction of a final non-appealable orders in connection with
the Enforcement Action finding that the Buyer is not entitled to a refund of
the Option Price.

(c) any of the representations and warranties of Sellers under

to be false when made as of the date of this Option Agreement, except in each
case where to the extent that the failure of any such representations and
warranties to be true and correct as of such date shall not have had a
Material Adverse Effect on the Casablanca Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

 

 

(d) the material breach by Sellers of any of their covenants under Section 6.1
hereof, which default is not cured within 30 days after written notice
thereof by the Buyer to Sellers;

11.2  Indemnification.

 

 

 

(a) Sellers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold the Buyer and
its Affiliates and their respective directors (or Persons in
similar positions), officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against
any Damages arising from or in connection with or otherwise with respect to
(i) any inaccuracy in any representation or the breach of any warranty of any
Seller under the Transaction Documents relating to Casablanca Holdings, (ii)
the failure of any Seller to duly perform or observe any term, provision,
covenant or agreement to be performed or observed by it pursuant to this
Option Agreement, or (iii) any Excluded Liability.

 

 

(b) The Buyer shall indemnify and hold each Seller and its Affiliates and its
respective directors (or Persons in similar positions), officers, employees,
agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties"
and, together with the Buyer Indemnified Parties, the "Indemnified Parties")
harmless from and against any Damages arising from or in connection with or
otherwise with respect to (i) any inaccuracy in any representation or the
breach of any warranty of the Buyer under this Option Agreement or any
certificate or other instrument delivered by the Buyer at the Closing
pursuant to the provisions of  Section 8, (ii) the failure of the Buyer to
duly perform or observe any term, provision, covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by it pursuant to this Option Agreement, or (iii) any
Assumed Indebtedness.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, other than with respect
to any Excluded Liability, (i) no indemnification shall be available to any
Buyer Indemnified Party under Section  11.2 (a) if the Damages to which the
Buyer Indemnified Parties would otherwise be entitled to indemnification with
respect to any single breach or inaccuracy are less than $100,000; and (ii)
no indemnification shall be available to any Buyer Indemnified Party under
Section  11.2 (a) unless and until the aggregate amount of the Damages for
which the Buyer Indemnified Parties (as applicable) seek
indemnification (excluding Damages not available as a result of clause (i)
above) exceeds a one-time deductible amount of $1,000,000 (the "Deductible
Amount"), in which case the relevant Buyer Indemnified Parties entitled to
such indemnification shall be entitled to recover all such Damages to which
such Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled in excess of such Damages
constituting the Deductible Amount. Other than with respect to any Assumed
Indebtedness, (A) no indemnification shall be available to any Seller
Indemnified Party under Section  11.2 (b) if the Damages to which the Seller
Indemnified Parties would otherwise be entitled to indemnification with
respect to any single breach or inaccuracy are less than $100,000, and (B) no
indemnification shall be available to any Seller Indemnified Parties under
Section  11.2 (b) unless and until the aggregate amount of the Damages for
which the Seller Indemnified Parties (as applicable) seek
indemnification (excluding Damages not available as a result of Section
11.2(c)(i) exceeds the one time Deductible Amount, in which case the relevant
Seller Indemnified Parties entitled to such indemnification shall be entitled
to recover such Damages to which such Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled
in excess of such Damages constituting the Deductible Amount. The obligations
of Sellers pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Section  11.2, and recourse against the Sellers pursuant to this Section
 11.2, shall be limited such that the aggregate liability of Sellers under
this Section  11.2 shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the Final Purchase
Price (the "General Indemnification Cap") in the aggregate. The obligations
of the Buyer pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Section  11.2, and recourse against the Buyer pursuant to this Section
 11.2, shall be limited such that the aggregate liability of the Buyer under
this Section  11.2 shall not exceed in the aggregate the then
General Indemnification Cap; provided, however, that, for the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing limitations set forth in this Section  11.2 (c),
including, without limitation, the Deductible Amount and the General
Indemnification Cap, shall not apply to (X) any Excluded Liability, and
(pursuant to Section  11.2 (a)) Sellers shall indemnify and hold the
Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any Damages arising from
or in connection with or otherwise with respect to any Excluded Liability
from the first dollar of any Excluded Liability and without any cap or other
limitation with respect to the amount thereof and (Y) any Assumed
Indebtedness, and (pursuant to Section  11.2 (b)) Buyer shall indemnify and
hold the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any Damages
arising from or in connection with or otherwise with respect to any Assumed
Indebtedness from the first dollar of any Damages incurred without any cap or
other limitation with respect to the amount thereof. Notwithstanding anything
in this Option Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of determining the
amount of Damages to which an Indemnified Party is entitled under Section
 11.2, but not for determining whether or not any inaccuracy or breach has
occurred, all of the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in
this Option Agreement that are qualified by "material," "materiality,"
"material respects," or words of similar import shall be deemed to have been
made without any such qualification for purposes of determining the amount of
Damages resulting from, arising out of or relating to any such breach or
violation of representation, warranty or covenant.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Each Indemnified Party, upon it or (as applicable) its directors
(or Persons in similar positions) or officers becoming aware of any event
which gives rise to any indemnification rights such Indemnified Party has or
may have under this Section  11.2, shall take reasonable steps to mitigate
any Damages in respect of which such indemnification may be sought, including
(i) using its commercially reasonable efforts to secure payment from
available insurance arrangements, including insurance arrangements maintained
by any Tenant with respect to any Casablanca Subsidiary or Casablanca
Property that are to provide coverage with respect to such Damages (an
"Insurance Payment") and (ii) using its commercially reasonable efforts to
secure reimbursement, indemnity or other payment from any third Person
obligated by Contract or otherwise to reimburse, indemnify or pay the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Damages (a "Third Party Payment" and,
together with an Insurance Payment, a "Mitigation Payment"); provided,
however, that no such Indemnified Party shall be required to pursue any
potential source of a Mitigation Payment prior to seeking indemnification
hereunder or incur any material costs or expenses (unless the Indemnifying
Party agrees to reimburse such costs and expenses) or take any action
materially adverse to such Indemnified Party in complying with its obligation
to mitigate under this Section  11.2 (d) and in no event may any
Indemnifying Party assert any failure to mitigate by an Indemnified Party as
a defense to a claim for indemnification hereunder.

 

 

(e) Any calculation of Damages for purposes of this Section  11.2 shall be
net of (i) any Mitigation Payment actually received; provided, however that
the Mitigation Payment received or recovered shall be reduced by the amount
of any out-of-pocket costs incurred in pursuing such Mitigation Payment; and
(ii) Tax benefits actually realized under applicable Law in respect of such
Damages, in each case net of all reasonable costs and expenses of recovering
any such Tax benefits, whether realized in the year in which payments of
Damages are made or thereafter. In the event a payment is made to an
Indemnified Party with respect to any Damages and thereafter the Indemnified
Party receives a Mitigation Payment with respect to such Damages, the
Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Parties an amount equal to
the lesser of (x) the Mitigation Payment and (y) the amount so paid by the
Indemnifying Parties.

 

 

(f) Upon receipt by any Indemnified Party of written notice from any third
party of any action, suit, proceedings, claim, demand or assessment by such
third party against such Indemnified Party which would reasonably be expected
to give rise to a claim for Damages hereunder, such Indemnified Party shall
as promptly as practicable give written notice thereof to the Buyer
or Sellers (as applicable, the "Indemnifying Party"), if indemnification
shall be sought therefrom, indicating the nature of such claim and the basis
therefor; provided, however, that failure to give such notice shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its option and
expense (and by its own counsel), to assume the defense of any such matter
involving the liability of the Indemnified Party asserted by a third party as
to which the Indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder. If any Indemnifying Party shall
undertake to compromise or defend any such asserted liability, it shall
promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its intention to do so,
and the Indemnified Party will cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party
and its counsel in the compromise of, or defense against, any such asserted
liability; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle
any such asserted liability without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement (x) includes only the payment
of monetary damages, (y) does not impose any injunctive or equitable relief
upon the Indemnified Party and (z) includes a complete and unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party and does not include any admission of
wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding any such election to
assume the defense of such action or proceeding, such Indemnified Party shall
have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense
of such action or proceeding, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the
reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel (and shall pay
such fees, costs and expenses at least quarterly), if the Indemnified Party
shall have reasonably concluded that (i) there may be a conflict of interest
(including one or more legal defenses or counterclaims available to it or to
other Indemnified Parties which are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party) that would make it inappropriate in the
reasonable judgment of such Indemnified Party for the same counsel to
represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, (ii) the
claim seeks non-monetary relief which, if granted, could materially and
adversely affect such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates (in which case,
notwithstanding any other term of this Option Agreement, the Indemnifying
Party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action or
proceeding on behalf of such Indemnified Party), (iii) the Indemnifying
Party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party to represent such Indemnified Party within a reasonable
time after notice of the institution of such action or proceeding (for the
avoidance of doubt, Bryan Cave LLP and Hogan and Hartson LLP shall each be
deemed satisfactory counsel) or (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall authorize
such Indemnified Party to employ separate counsel at the Indemnifying Party's
expense.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the parties hereto agree to
treat any payment made pursuant to this Section  11.2 as an adjustment to the
consideration paid pursuant to this Option Agreement for all Tax purposes.

 

 

(h) Sellers and the Buyer hereby acknowledge and agree that, from and after
the Closing Date, the foregoing indemnification provisions in this Section
 11.2 shall be the sole and exclusive rights and remedy of any Indemnified
Party with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Option Agreement,
including, without limitation, with respect to (a) any misrepresentation,
breach or default of or under any of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Option Agreement or (b) any
failure duly to perform or observe any term, provision, covenant or agreement
contained in this Option Agreement; provided, however, that nothing set forth
herein shall be deemed to limit any party's rights or remedies in the event
that the other party has committed fraud in connection herewith.

 

 

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Option Agreement, Sellers
shall have no obligation to indemnify, defend, or hold harmless
Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to Damages related to Remediation of
Hazardous Materials if such Damages arise solely from environmental sampling
performed by Buyer indiscriminately and for the sole purpose of discovering
conditions which would require Remediation under applicable Law.

 

 

 

11.3 Environmental Remediation

 

 

 

(a) Any Remediation for which an Indemnified Party seeks indemnification from
Sellers under this Section 11 shall be governed by this Section 11.3.

 

 

(b) Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have the right to perform Remediation and
seek indemnification from Sellers for related costs or shall, at their sole
option, elect to have Sellers perform all or a portion of such Remediation.

 

 

(c) Any Party performing a Remediation the cost of which is the
responsibility of Sellers pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement
("Performing Party") shall: (i) provide written notification to the other
Party ("Other Party") that it intends to perform Remediation prior
to commencing any such Remediation; (ii) shall select a qualified consultant
to oversee the Remediation, subject to the approval of the Other Party,
whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld; (iii) provide the Other
Party with a reasonable opportunity to comment in advance upon any material
written communications, filings, reports, correspondence or other writings
given to any Governmental Entity in connection with such Remediation and
consider timely provided comments in good faith; (iv) to the extent
practical, provide the Other Party with a reasonable opportunity to
participate in any meetings with any Governmental Authority regarding the
Remediation at such Other Party's sole cost and expense; (v) comply with
applicable Laws; (vi) minimize costs in conducting any Remediation and employ
cost-effective Remediation methods that are commercially reasonable under the
circumstances; (vii) use risk based clean-up standards and employ deed
restrictions and institutional and engineering controls to the extent
commercially reasonable; (viii) allow the Other Party or their agents
reasonable access to the Casablanca Properties for purposes of observing the
Remediation so long as such Other Party and its agents do not interfere with
the Remediation or the operation of the business conducted thereon; (ix) keep
the Other Party reasonably informed of the progress of any such Remediation
and the schedule for completing such Remediation; (x) within five (5)
business days of receipt, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to
the Other Party copies of all material written communications, filings,
reports, correspondence or other writings, photographs or materials received
from any Person (including any Governmental Authority) in connection with the
performance of any such Remediation; and (xi) use commercially reasonable
efforts to preserve any rights the Other Party may have against insurers or
other third parties.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Buyer shall permit Sellers and their representatives and consultants
access to the applicable real property (i) for purpose of performing the
Remediation, to the extent Sellers are performing the Remediation, so long as
Sellers use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize interference with the
business conducted thereon and (ii) for observing and monitoring the
Remediation if Buyer is performing the Remediation, so long as Sellers uses
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize interference with Buyer's
Remediation or the business conducted thereon. Following completion of any
Remediation performed by Sellers, Sellers shall promptly return the real
property to substantially the same condition in which it existed prior to the
commencement of the Remediation (other than with respect to the presence of
Hazardous Materials). Buyer Indemnified Parties shall reasonably cooperate
with Sellers with respect to any Remediation performed by Sellers in

(ii)(A) above plus the uncollected insurance proceeds or tenant contributions
to the cure reasonably expected to be collected after the relevant Closing by
the Casablanca Subsidiary and described in (ii)(B) above;

 

 

provided, however, that if such amount in the aggregate is less than One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000), then (a) no reduction shall be made to
the Final Purchase Price and (b) such amount shall count against the
Deductible Amount for purposes of indemnification claims under Section 11.2
without regard to the limitations set forth in Section 11.2(c)(i); provided,
further, that if the Deductible Amount has otherwise been reached, then such
reduction (or a reduction to the extent of the excess over the Deductible

14.5 Assignment and Benefit.

 

 

 

(a) This Option Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Neither
this Option Agreement, nor any of the rights hereunder or thereunder, may be
assigned by any party, nor may any party delegate any obligations hereunder
or thereunder, without the written consent of the other parties hereto or

from its obligations hereunder upon any such assignment). Any assignment or
attempted assignment other than in accordance with this Section  14.5 (a)
shall be void ab initio.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Except as provided in Section  6.7 (Seller Releases) and Section  11.2
(Indemnification), this Option Agreement shall not be construed as giving any
Person, other than the parties hereto and their permitted successors, heirs
and assigns, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in
respect of this Option Agreement or any of the provisions herein contained,
this Option Agreement and all provisions and conditions hereof being intended
to be, and being, for the sole and exclusive benefit of such parties, and
their respective permitted successors, heirs and assigns and for the benefit
of no other Person or entity.

 

 

 

14.6  Amendment, Modification and Waiver.

 

 

 

The parties hereto may amend or modify, or may waive any right or obligation
under, this Option Agreement in any respect, provided that any
such amendment, modification or waiver shall be in writing and executed by
the Buyer and Sellers. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this
Option Agreement shall constitute or operate as a waiver of any other breach
of such provision or of any other provision hereof, nor shall any failure to
enforce any provision hereof operate as a waiver of such provision or of any
other provision hereof.

 

 

 

14.7 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction.

 

 

 

This Option Agreement is made pursuant to, and shall be construed and
enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed in that State, irrespective of the
principal place of business, residence or domicile of the parties hereto, and
without giving effect to otherwise applicable principles of conflicts of law.
Any legal action, suit or Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Option Agreement shall be instituted, heard and determined exclusively in any
federal court or in any state court located in Wilmington, Delaware, and each
party hereto hereby waives any objection which such party may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such action, suit
or Proceeding, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits to
the jurisdiction of any such court. Any and all service of process and any
other notice in any such action, suit or Proceeding shall be
effective against any party hereto if given as provided in Section  14.4.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of any party to
serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law.

 

 

 

14.8 Section Headings and Defined Terms.

 

 

 

The section headings contained herein are for reference purposes only and
shall not in any way affect the meaning and interpretation of any of the
provisions of this Option Agreement. Except as otherwise indicated,
all agreements defined herein refer to the same as from time to time amended
or supplemented or the terms thereof waived or modified in accordance
herewith and therewith. All references to Schedules herein shall be
references to Schedules in the Purchase Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14.9  Severability.

 

 

 

If any term or other provision of this Option Agreement is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Option Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Option Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in
a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

 

 

14.10 Counterparts.

 

 

 

This Option Agreement and the other documents required to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original (including facsimile and PDF
signatures), and all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same
instrument. The parties hereto may deliver this Option Agreement and the
other documents required to consummate the transactions contemplated herein
by telecopier machine/facsimile or via e-mail and each party shall
be permitted to rely upon the signatures so transmitted to the same extent
and effect as if they were original signatures.

 

 

 

14.11 Entire Agreement.

 

 

 

This Option Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, the Disclosure
Schedule and the schedules and exhibits hereto constitute the
entire agreement between the parties hereto, and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings (written or oral), with respect to such
subject matter.

 

 

 

14.12 Waiver of Jury Trial.

 

 

 

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS OPTION AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14.13 Remedies.

 

 

 

Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and
the exercise by a party of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights and remedies
contained in this Option Agreement shall constitute the sole and exclusive
means of recourse against Sellers with respect to any current or future
environmental conditions at, on, under or emanating from any of
the Casablanca Properties or any other real property currently or formerly
owned by Casablanca Holdings, and the Buyer expressly waives any and all
other claims, rights, or causes of action it may have against Sellers, now or
in the future, arising under, in connection with or relating to any
Environmental Law (whether by statute, regulation, or common law) with
respect to such properties. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Option Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Option
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Option
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which the parties
are entitled at Law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Option Agreement, in no event shall either party to this Option
Agreement be liable for punitive damages however caused and on any theory of
liability, arising out of the performance of, or the failure to perform, any
obligation(s) set forth herein.
