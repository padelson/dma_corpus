_Company_ "), Harris Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and
Harris Communication Solutions (Indiana), Inc., an Indiana corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ," with the Company and
Merger Sub sometimes being hereinafter referred to, together, as the "
_Constituent Corporations_ ").

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company (i) have approved the merger of the Merger Sub with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, (ii) have approved and declared advisable this
Agreement, (iii) in the case of the Company, have determined that the Merger
is advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders, and (iv) in the case of the Company and Merger Sub, have
adopted this Agreement in accordance with the Indiana Business Corporation Law
(the " _IBCL_ ") and have determined to recommend the approval of the Merger
to their respective shareholders; and

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the IBCL,
at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company
and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The
Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes
hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, and the separate corporate existence of the Company,
with all of its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall
continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects specified
in the IBCL.

1.2.  _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York,
New York, at  9:00 A.M. on the third (3rd) business day (the " _Closing Date_ ") following
the day on which the last to be satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law)
waived of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be first satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those
conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VIII, if the proceeds of the Financing are
not then available in full (and Parent has complied in all respects with the
provisions of the first and last sentences of Section 7.13(b), and in all
material respects with the other provisions of Section 7.13(b)) on the date
that would otherwise be the Closing Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall not be
required to effect the Closing until such date on which the proceeds of the
Financing are available in full (subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VIII as of such date). For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _business day_ " shall mean any day ending at 11:59 p.m.
(Eastern Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks are
required or authorized to close in the City of New York.

1.3. _Effective Time_. At the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger (the " _Articles of
Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Indiana in such form as
required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the
IBCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required by the IBCL to
effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the
Articles of Merger have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Indiana or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties in
writing and specified in the Articles of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

ARTICLE II

 

 _Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws_

 

 _of the Surviving Corporation_

 

2.1. _The Articles of Incorporation_. Subject to Section 7.10, the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended at the Effective
Time to be the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Charter_ "), until thereafter
duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (except as to the name
of the Surviving Corporation, which shall be Exelis Inc.).

2.2. _The By-Laws_. Subject to Section 7.10, the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended at the Effective Time to be the by-laws of Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _By-Laws_ "),
until thereafter duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Law
(except as to the name of the Surviving Corporation, which shall be Exelis
Inc.).

 



2 ARTICLE III

 

 _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_

 

3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and
the By-Laws.

ARTICLE IV

 

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_

 

 _Exchange of Certificates_

 

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holder of any capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01
per share (the " _Common Stock_ ") of the Company (collectively, the "
_Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and in each
case not held on behalf of third parties, collectively, the " _Excluded
Shares_ ") shall be automatically converted into the right to receive: (i)
$16.625 in cash (the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ ") and (ii) 0.1025
shares of common stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), par value $1.00 per share
(the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") of Parent (the " _Per Share Stock
Consideration_ " and collectively with the Per Share Cash Consideration, the
" _Per Share Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall
cease to be outstanding, be cancelled and cease to exist, and each certificate
(a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) and any Shares (other than Excluded Shares) held in book-
entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive the Per Share Consideration, without interest. All Per Share Cash
Consideration to which a single record holder of Shares is entitled to receive
hereunder shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to the nearest
whole cent.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of such Excluded
Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and cease to exist.

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



3 (d) _Adjustments_. If, between the date hereof and the Effective Time,
the Parent Common Stock or the Common Stock shall have been increased,
decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares
or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment
shall be made to the Per Share Consideration to provide the holders of Shares
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 4.1(d) shall be construed to
permit Parent or the Company to take any action with respect to their
respective securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall make available or
cause to be made available to an exchange agent selected by Parent with the
Companys prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), amounts in immediately
available cash and Parent Common Stock sufficient in order for the Exchange
Agent to distribute the Per Share Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1(a) and
Section 4.2(e) (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall invest the
cash portion of the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that (i)
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks and (ii) no such investment (or
losses thereon) shall affect the amount of Per Share Consideration payable to
the holders of Shares and Parent shall be responsible for making available the
full payment in respect thereof irrespective of any such investment (or losses
thereon). Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall
become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable under Section 4.1(a) and Section 4.2(e) shall be promptly returned to
Parent. No later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing, Parent
shall enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (which confirmation of satisfaction
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to effect the
applicable terms of this Agreement.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within
five (5) business days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) represented
by

 



4  Certificates: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(g)) to the Exchange Agent;
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section
4.2(g)) in exchange for the Per Share Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in
Section 4.2(g)) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form
unless a physical certificate is requested by such holder of record) that such
holder is entitled to receive as Per Share Stock Consideration in respect of
such holders properly surrendered Certificates pursuant to this Article
IV, if any, (B) a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.3) equal to
the amount of cash (consisting of the Per Share Cash Consideration and cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to
Section 4.2(e)), if any, that such holder is entitled to receive in respect of
such holders properly surrendered Certificates pursuant to this Article IV,
and (C) any dividends and other distributions that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 4.2(c), and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, the Per Share Consideration may be delivered to such
transferee in accordance with this Section 4.2(b)(i) if the Certificate
formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are
not applicable.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Per Share Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 4.1(a). In lieu thereof, each holder of record of
one or more Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Consideration and any dividends or other distributions
payable thereon pursuant to Section 4.2(c) shall automatically upon the
Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
(and in any event within five (5) business days thereafter), in respect of
each Book-Entry Share (A) that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
(which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested by such holder of record) that such holder is
entitled to receive as Per Share Stock Consideration in respect of such
holders Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article IV, if any, (B) a cash

 



5  amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required
Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.3) equal to the amount of cash
(consisting of the Per Share Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section
4.2(e)), if any, that such holder is entitled to receive in respect of such
holders Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article IV, and (C) any dividends
and other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 4.2(c), and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be
cancelled.

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. All shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time and, whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Common Stock, the
record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(i) _Certificates_. No dividends or other distributions in respect of the
Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate until such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(g)) is surrendered for exchange in
accordance with this Article IV. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(g)) for exchange in accordance with
this Article IV, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (whether in non-certificated
book-entry form or represented by a physical certificate pursuant to Section
4.2(b)(i)), without interest, (i) (A) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and
(B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends and other distributions
payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a
record date at or after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to
the time of such surrender to the extent such holder holds such shares of
Parent Common Stock on the applicable record date and (ii) at the time of
such surrender, all dividends or other distributions with a record date prior
to the Effective Time, that have been declared by the Company with respect to
the Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, but that have not
been paid on such Shares.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Holders of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange for Book-Entry Shares shall be issued and/or paid, without interest,
(i) (A) at the time of payment and delivery of such shares of Parent Common
Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 4.2(b)(ii), the dividends or
other distributions with a record date at or after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and
(B) at the appropriate

 



6  payment date, the dividends and other distributions payable with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date at or after the
Effective Time and payment date subsequent to the time of such payment and
delivery pursuant to clause (A) to the extent such holder holds such shares of
Parent Common Stock on the applicable record date and (ii) at the time of
payment and delivery of such shares of Parent Common Stock by the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 4.2(b)(ii), all dividends or other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time, that have been declared by the
Company with respect to the Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, but that have not been paid on such Shares.

(d) _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock_. The Per Share
Consideration delivered in accordance with the terms of this Article IV upon
the surrender of the Certificates (or, automatically, in the case of the Book-
Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been delivered in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such Shares (other than the right to receive the
payments and deliveries contemplated by this Article IV). From and after the
Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall
cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company other than the right
to receive the Per Share Consideration into which the whole shares represented
by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to
this Agreement upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with Section 4.2(b) (together with any fractional share cash
payment pursuant to Section 4.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions to
which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance
with Section 4.2(c), in each case if applicable), without interest and (ii)
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented
to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer, it
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Per Share Consideration to which the
holder of the Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.

(e)  _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued in
respect of a holders Shares. In lieu thereof, any holder of Shares entitled
to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock but for this Section
4.2(e) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment (rounded to the nearest
whole cent) without interest, which payment shall be calculated by the
Exchange Agent as an amount equal to the product of (i) such holders
proportionate interest in a share of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the average
of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of Parent Common Stock
on the NYSE (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported by Bloomberg
L.P., in another authoritative source mutually selected by the parties) on
each of the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the
trading day that is three (3) trading days prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Parent Trading Price_ "). All fractional shares to which a single record
holder of Shares would otherwise be entitled to receive hereunder shall be
aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places.

 



7 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including cash, certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock
and the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) that has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Per Share Consideration and
any other applicable amounts pursuant to this Section 4.2 (in each case,
after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section
4.3) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
the Certificates), without any interest thereon. Any Per Share Consideration
remaining unclaimed by former holders of Common Stock immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Exchange Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
amount delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-
profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or
other entity of any kind or nature.

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by
such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be
required by Parent or the Exchange Agent as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will distribute the Per Share Consideration
and any other applicable amounts pursuant to this Section 4.2 with respect to
each Share represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

 

4.3. _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares and to any holder of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company
Restricted Stock, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such
withheld

 



8  amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or by
the Exchange Agent (on behalf of Parent or the Surviving Corporation), as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity within the period required
under applicable Law, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares or to the holder of
Company Options, Company RSUs or Company Restricted Stock, as the case may
be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 

4.4. _No Dissenters  Rights_. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
holders of Shares are not entitled to any dissenters rights under Chapter 44
of the IBCL.

4.5. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding and
unexercised option to purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") under the
Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, be
cancelled and cease to exist and shall only entitle the holder of such
Company Option to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(x) the total number of Shares subject to the Company Option  _multiplied_
_by_ (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Equity Award Consideration over
the exercise price per Share of such Company Option. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Per Share Equity Award Consideration_ " shall mean the sum of
(1) the Per Share Cash Consideration _plus_ (2) the product of (x) the
Exchange Ratio and (y) the Parent Trading Price.

 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, any vesting
conditions or restrictions applicable to each outstanding restricted stock
unit (a " _Company RSU_ ", other than any Rollover RSU) under the Stock Plans
shall lapse, and each Company RSU shall, whether vested or unvested,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled and cease to exist and shall
only entitle the holder of such Company RSU to receive as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the sum of the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to
such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied_ _by_ (y)
the Per Share Equity Award Consideration, _plus_ any accrued dividend
payments by the Company in respect of such Company RSU; _provided_ , _however_
, that to the extent any such payment would cause an impermissible
acceleration event under Section 409A of the Code, such amounts shall become
vested at the Effective Time and will be paid at the earliest time such
payment would not cause an impermissible acceleration event under Section
409A.

 

(c) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, any restrictions
or vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding Share subject to any
restrictions or vesting conditions (each, a share of " _Company Restricted
Stock_ ")

 



9  under the Stock Plans shall lapse, and each such share of Company Restricted
Stock shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into only the right to receive the Per Share
Consideration and shall cease to be outstanding, be cancelled, and cease to
exist pursuant to Section 4.1, and with respect to any share of Company
Restricted Stock, payment shall occur in accordance with the applicable terms
and conditions of such share of Company Restricted Stock and applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any such payment would cause an
impermissible acceleration event under Section 409A of the Code, such amounts
will be paid at the earliest time such payment would not cause an
impermissible payment event under Section 409A.

 

(d) _Treatment of Rollover RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Rollover RSU shall, without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled in exchange for a restricted stock unit covering a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded up to the nearest whole
share, equal to (x) the total number of Shares subject to such award
of Rollover RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied_ _by_
(y) the sum of (1) the Per Share Stock Consideration plus (2)(A) the Per Share
Cash Consideration divided by (B) the Parent Trading Price (a " _Substitute
RSU_ "). From and after the Effective Time, each Substitute RSU shall be
subject to the same vesting conditions and payment terms as were applicable to
such Rollover RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the terms set
forth in Section 7.1(a)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Letter. " _Rollover RSU_
" means any Company RSU granted pursuant to and in accordance with Section
7.1(a)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(e) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee and/or the
nominating and governance committee of the board of directors of the Company,
as applicable, shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to take any
actions which are necessary or desirable to effectuate the provisions of
Sections 4.5(a) and through 4.5(c), including adopting any resolutions, and to
take any actions reasonably requested by Parent to effectuate such provisions
(including, if requested by Parent, seeking acknowledgments from the holders
of Company Options concerning the treatment described herein).

 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_

 

Except as set forth in (x) the Company Reports (as defined in Section 5.5(a))
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") that are
publicly available as of the date of this Agreement and were filed after
December 31, 2013 and prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding, in each
case, any disclosures set forth in the risk factors section or in the
"Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" section of any
Company Reports, any other disclosure that

 



10  constitutes risk factors or that is cautionary, predictive or forward-
looking in nature and any amendment to any such Company Report filed by or on
behalf of the Company after the date hereof);  _provided_ , _however_ , that
the exception provided for in this clause (x) shall not apply to Section 5.3;
(y) the Form 10 filed by the Spun Entity (excluding any disclosures set forth
in the risk factors section or in the "Special Note About Forward-Looking
Statements" section of such Form 10 and any amendment thereto, any other
disclosure that constitutes risk factors or that is cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature and any amendment to any such Form 10 filed after
the date hereof); or (z) the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior to entering into
this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being understood
that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter (other than any information set forth in Section 5.13 of the
Company Disclosure Letter) shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the
sections or subsections of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number
and each other section or subsection of this Agreement only to the extent that
the relevance of such item to such other section or other subsection is
reasonably apparent on its face), the Company hereby represents and warrants
to Parent and Merger Sub that:

5.1. _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. The Company is a
corporation duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of Indiana and
the Company has all requisite corporate power and authority necessary to
enable it to use its corporate name and to own, lease or otherwise hold, use
and operate its properties, rights and other assets and to carry on its
business as currently conducted. Each Subsidiary of the Company is a legal
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (if and to the
extent such term is so recognized in such jurisdiction) under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite
corporate or similar power and authority; and each of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries possesses all governmental licenses, permits, authorizations
and approvals, necessary to enable it to use its corporate or other name and
to own, lease or otherwise hold, use and operate its properties, rights and
other assets and necessary to carry on its business as currently conducted,
except where the failure to be so organized, existing, in good standing,
qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing (if and to the extent such term is so
recognized in such jurisdiction) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets, properties
or the conduct of its business makes such qualification, licensing or good
standing necessary, other than where the failure to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made available to Parent, prior to the date of this Agreement,
true, correct and complete copies of the articles of incorporation and by-
laws or comparable governing documents for each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries that are not directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Company,
each as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as made available is
in full force and effect, and the Company and such Subsidiaries are each not
in

 



11  violation of any of their respective provisions. Section 5.1 of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and correct list of each Person of which
at least a majority of the securities or ownership interests having by their
terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or
other persons performing similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by the Company and/or by one or more of its Subsidiaries (each
Person so listed, when used herein with respect to the Company, a "
_Subsidiary_ ").

As otherwise used herein, the term (a) " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect
to any Person other than the Company, any other Person of which at least a
majority of the securities or ownership interests having by their terms
ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or other
persons performing similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by such Person and/or by one or more of its Subsidiaries, and (b) "
_Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any event, change, effect,
development, state of facts, condition, circumstance or occurrence that has a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, properties, assets,
liabilities, business or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that none of the following, or the direct results thereof, shall constitute a
Company Material Adverse Effect:

 

(i) changes in the economy or financial markets generally in the United
States;

 

(ii) changes that are the result of factors generally affecting the industries
in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate;

(iii) changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") or in any Law of general applicability after the date of this
Agreement;

(iv) a decline in the price, or a change in the trading volume, of the Shares
( _provided_ , _however_ , that the exception in this clause (iv) shall not
apply to the underlying causes giving rise to or contributing to any such
decline or change and shall not prevent any of such underlying causes from
being taken into account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse
Effect has occurred or would be reasonably likely to occur unless otherwise
excluded pursuant to any of the other clauses of this definition);

 

(v) the failure to meet internal or analysts expectations or projections for
results of operations ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the exception in this
clause (v) shall not apply to the underlying causes giving rise to or
contributing to any such failure and shall not prevent any of such underlying
causes from being taken into account in determining whether a Company
Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would be reasonably likely to occur
unless otherwise excluded pursuant to any of the other clauses of this
definition);

 



12 (vi) acts of war, insurrection, sabotage or terrorism (or the escalation of
the foregoing), or any weather-related or other force majeure event or
natural disaster;

(vii) the execution, delivery, announcement or pendency of this Agreement or
the consummation of the Transactions (including the impact thereof on the
relationships, contractual or otherwise, of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with employees, customers, suppliers or business partners) (
_provided_ that the exception in this clause (vii) shall not apply to any
representations and warranties contained in this Article V that address the
consequences from the execution, delivery, announcement or pendency of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions); or

(viii) actions (or omissions) of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as
expressly required to comply with the terms of this Agreement ( _provided_
that the exception in this clause (viii) shall not apply to any obligation to
operate in the ordinary course of business or any similar provisions in the
Agreement);

_provided_ _further_ , that with respect to clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (vi)
above, such event, change, effect, development, state of facts, condition,
circumstance or occurrence shall be taken into account to the extent it has a
disproportionately adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, compared to other companies operating in the industry in which
the Company and its Subsidiaries operate.

5.2. _Capital Structure_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 750,000,000
Shares, par value $0.01, of which 185,810,234 were outstanding as of the

As of the close of business on February 3, 2015, the Company holds 7,299,859
Shares in treasury. As of the close of business on February 3, 2015,
13,307,815 Shares are reserved for issuance in respect of outstanding awards

respect of share-settled Company RSUs. Other than Shares that are reserved

the Company Disclosure Letter contains a list of the Company Options, Company
Restricted Stock and Company RSUs (whether share- or cash-settled), including
the holder, date of grant, term, number of Shares and exercise price and
vesting schedule, as applicable, in each case

 



13  that is true, correct and complete in all material respects as of the close
of business on February 3, 2015. Each of the outstanding shares of capital
stock or other securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the
Company or by a Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any lien, charge,
pledge, security interest, mortgage, easement, title matter or other
encumbrance of any kind (excluding transfer restrictions of general
applicability pursuant to securities Laws) (each, a " _Lien_ "). Except as
stated otherwise in this Section 5.2(a), there are no preemptive or other
outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, "phantom" stock
rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights,
agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that
obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares
of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire,
any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or
obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding.
There are no voting trusts or similar agreements to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the capital stock
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Upon any issuance of any Shares in
accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The Company does not
have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations that give
the holders thereof the right to vote (or are convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for securities having the right to vote) with the
shareholders of the Company on any matter.

(b) Section 5.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (x) a list of
each of the Companys Subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the Company
in each such Subsidiary, as well as, to the Companys knowledge and as of
the date hereof, the ownership interest of any other Person or Persons in
each such Subsidiary and (y) the Companys or its Subsidiaries capital stock,
equity interest or other direct or indirect ownership interest in any other
Person other than securities in a publicly traded company held for investment
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and consisting of less than one
percent (1%) of the outstanding capital stock of such company.

all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions, subject only to approval of this Agreement by the holders of a
majority of the total voting power of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote
on such matter at a shareholders meeting duly called and held for such
purpose (the " _Requisite Company Vote_ "). This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Company enforceable

 



14  against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to
general equity principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

Agreement, the board of directors of the Company (A) unanimously determined
that the terms of this Agreement and the Merger are fair to, and in the best

and resolved to recommend approval of this Agreement to the holders of Shares
(the " _Company Recommendation_ "), (B) unanimously directed that this
Agreement be submitted to the holders of Shares for their approval as

received the written opinion of its financial advisor, J.P. Morgan Securities,
LLC to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and
subject to the various qualifications, assumptions and limitations set forth
therein, the Per Share Consideration is fair from a financial point of view to
such holders (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries), a copy of which opinion
has been delivered to Parent promptly after the date of this Agreement, it
being understood and agreed that such opinion is for the benefit of the
Companys board of directors and may not be relied upon by Parent or Merger

5.4. _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts_.

(a) Other than (i) the proxy statement/prospectus to be sent to the

municipality, jurisdiction or other political subdivision thereof (each, a "
_Governmental Entity_ "), in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
Merger and the other Transactions, except where the failure to make or obtain
any such Consents, has not had and would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to (x) have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or (y) prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
ability of the Company to consummate the Transactions. For purposes of this

having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or
lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company

result in (i) a breach or violation of, or a default under, or conflict with
the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or the comparable
governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) with or without notice,

which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, or (iii) any change
in the rights or obligations of any party under any Contract binding upon the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clause (ii) or
(iii) above, for any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation,
acceleration or change that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to (x) have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or (y) prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of
the Company to consummate the Transactions.

 

(c) As of the date hereof, the Company and its Subsidiaries are not creditors
or claimants with respect to any debtors or debtors-in-possession

 



16  subject to proceedings under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States
Code with respect to claims that, in the aggregate, constitute more than ten
percent (10%) of the gross assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(excluding cash and cash equivalents).

required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the " _Exchange Act_ ") or the Securities Act
since October 31, 2011 (the " _2011 Distribution Date_ ") (such filed or
furnished forms, statements, reports and documents, including any amendments
thereto, the " _Company Reports_ "). As of their respective dates of filing,
or, in the case of Company Reports that are registration statements filed
pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act prior to the date of this
Agreement, their respective effective dates, or if amended or superseded prior
to the date of this Agreement, then as of the date of such later filing, (A)
each Company Report complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable
thereto, and (B) none of the Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. None of the Companys Subsidiaries is required to
file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. The Company

(c) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the
SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company maintains internal
control

 



17  over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as
applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial
reporting is reasonably designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this
Agreement, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Companys
board of directors (x) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation
of its internal controls over financial reporting that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and has identified for the
Companys auditors and audit committee of the Companys board of directors any
material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and (y) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. The Company has made available to Parent (1) a summary of any such
disclosure made by management to the Companys auditors and audit committee
and (2) any material written communication made by management or the Companys
auditors since the 2011 Distribution Date to the audit committee required or
contemplated by listing standards of NYSE, the audit committees charter or
professional standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Since
the January 1, 2013, no material complaints from any source regarding
accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters have been
received by the Company. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of
all material complaints relating to other matters made through the Companys
whistleblower hot line or equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns
regarding possible violations of Law made since the 2011 Distribution Date.

 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or
obligation of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise,
whether known or unknown) whether or not required, if known, to be reflected
or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in
accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, except liabilities (i) as
reflected, reserved for or disclosed in the most recent audited balance sheet
of the Company included in the Companys most recent Form 10-K, as filed with
the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Most Recent Balance
Sheet_ "), (ii) as incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice since December 31, 2013, (iii) as incurred in connection with
the Transactions or (iv) that have not had and would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (x) have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or (y) prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of
the Company to consummate the Transactions. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to,
any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract
(including any Contract or arrangement relating to any transaction
or relationship between or among the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any

 



18  structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on
the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC)), where the result, purpose
or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Companys or such Subsidiarys published financial
statements or other Company Reports. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
" _Affiliate_ " when used with respect to any party shall mean any Person that
is an "affiliate" of that party within the meaning of Rule 405 promulgated
under the Securities Act.

(e) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position
of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and each of
the consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders equity
(deficit) and cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into the
Company Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents
in all material respects the results of operations, retained earnings (loss)
and changes in financial position, as the case may be, of such companies for
the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to (1) notes consistent with past practice in kind and content and (2) normal
year-end audit adjustments not material in amount or effect), and each of the
foregoing financial statements (i) was prepared or, in the case of
Company Reports filed or furnished after the date of this Agreement, will be
prepared, in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except as may be noted therein and except, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and (ii) complies
in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto.

has not been:

 

(i) any event, change, effect, development, state of facts, condition,
circumstance or occurrence (including any adverse change with respect to any
event, change, effect, development, state of facts, condition, circumstance or
occurrence existing on or prior to December 31, 2013) which, individually or
in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect;

 



19 (ii) any material damage, destruction or other casualty loss with respect to
any material asset or property owned, leased or otherwise used by the Company

owned Subsidiary of the Company), or any repurchase, redemption or other
acquisition by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any outstanding
shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries;

 

(iv) any material change in any method of accounting or accounting practice or
internal controls (including internal controls over financial reporting) by

or to become payable to the directors, officers or employees of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or (y) payment to any director or officer of the Company or
its Subsidiaries of any material bonus or any material profit-sharing or
similar payment, or grant to any director or officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries of any rights to receive material severance, termination, change

(vi) any agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to do any of the
foregoing.

 

5.8. _Litigation and Liabilities_. There are no civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, audits (other
than (x) audits in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice in respect of Government Contracts and (y) internal Company audits
that, in the case of (x) and (y), individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect), to the knowledge of the Company, investigations (other than

Adverse Effect), or other proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries except for
those that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to (i) have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (ii)
as of the date of this Agreement, prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of the Company to consummate the Transactions. None of

 



20  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the
provisions of any judgment, order, decision, writ, injunction, decree,
stipulation or legal or arbitration award of, or promulgated or issued by or
with (or settlement or consent agreement subject to) any Governmental Entity
(collectively, " _Orders_ "), except for those that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to (x) have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or (y) as of the date of this Agreement,
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to
consummate the Transactions.

 

5.9. _Assets_. Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (a) the
Company has good and marketable title to, or in the case of leased assets,

U.S. Government or a prime contractor under a Government Contract where the
Company is a subcontractor, and (c) each such item of tangible personal
property is in all respects in good operating condition and repair, ordinary
wear and tear excepted.

 

5.10. _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Section 5.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate
and complete list of each material Benefit Plan. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Benefit Plan_ " or " _Benefit Plans_ " means, collectively,
including the Stock Plans, each benefit or compensation plan, program, policy,
practice, contract, agreement or other arrangement, covering current or
former employees or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (" _ERISA_ "), "voluntary employees beneficiary associations," under
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, employment, retirement, severance, retention,
termination or change in control agreements, deferred compensation, vacation,
stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock-based or other
equity-based, incentive, bonus, supplemental retirement, profit sharing,
insurance, medical, welfare, fringe or other benefits, in each case, whether
or not material, whether or not in writing and whether or not funded, in each
case, which is sponsored, maintained or contributed to, or required to be
maintained or contributed to, or with respect to which any potential
liability is or may be borne by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates. The Company has separately identified in
Section 5.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter each Benefit Plan that
is maintained primarily for the benefit of employees outside of the United
States (a " _Non-U.S. Benefit Plan_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, "
_ERISA Affiliate_ " means all employers (whether or not incorporated) that
would be treated together with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
"single employer" within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code.

 



21 (b) With respect to each Benefit Plan, other than "multiemployer
plans" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (each, a " _Multiemployer
Plan_ "), the Company has used its best efforts to deliver or make available
to Parent, and the Company has delivered or made available in all
material respects to Parent, to the extent applicable, a true and complete
copy of (A) the Benefit Plan document and all related trust documents,
insurance contracts or other funding vehicles, in each case including any
amendments thereto, (B) a written description of such Benefit Plan if such
plan is not set forth in a written document, (C) most recent Annual Report
(Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedules, most recent annual financial
reports and most recent actuarial reports, if any, (D) the most recent
determination or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ "),
if any, and (E) each current summary plan description and summary of material
modifications, if any.

 

(c) (i) Each Benefit Plan (and any related trust or other funding vehicle),
other than Multiemployer Plans and Non-U.S. Benefit Plans (each, a " _U.S.
Benefit Plan_ "), has been established, operated and administered in material
compliance with its terms and applicable Laws, including ERISA, the Code and
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. (ii) All material
contributions or other amounts payable by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to each Benefit Plan in respect of current or prior
plan years have been paid or accrued in accordance with GAAP. (iii) To the
knowledge of the Company, all Shares issuable in respect of grants of Company
Options, Company Restricted Stock and Company RSUs were properly registered
under the Securities Act or qualified on the grant date for exemption from
registration under the Securities Act and other applicable laws (including
state "blue sky" laws). To the knowledge of the Company, the Shares available
for issuance under the Stock Plans have been properly registered pursuant to
the Securities Act on a Form S-8 or other available form.

(d) Each U.S. Benefit Plan (and any related trust) intended to be "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS as to its qualification, has a request for
such a letter pending with the IRS, or is a prototype plan that is
the subject of a favorable opinion letter from the IRS as to its
qualification, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no existing
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to affect adversely the
qualified status of any such U.S. Benefit Plan. With respect to each Benefit
Plan, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a
transaction in connection with which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
reasonably could be subject to either a material civil penalty assessed
pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a material tax imposed pursuant
to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred, and no condition exists that presents a risk of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries incurring, a material Tax or penalty
imposed by Section 4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA or any material
liability under Section 4071 of ERISA.

 



22 (e) No Controlled Group Liability has been incurred by the Company or its
ERISA Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists
that presents a risk to the Company or its ERISA Affiliates of incurring any
such liability, that has resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result
in, individually or in the aggregate, any material liability. " _Controlled
Group Liability_ " means any and all liabilities (1) under Title IV of ERISA,
(2) under Section 302 of ERISA, (3) under Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code,
and (4) under Section 4980B of the Code as a result of a failure to comply
with the continuation coverage requirements of Section 601 et seq. of ERISA
and Section 4980B of the Code. Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any
ERISA Affiliate has at any time sponsored or contributed to, or has or had any
liability or obligation in respect of, any (A) single-employer pension plan
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA for which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries could incur material liability under Section 4063 or
4064 of ERISA or (B) a "multiple employer welfare plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(40) of ERISA, and in each case, to the knowledge of the Company, no
fact or event exists that would give rise to any such liability. Section
5.10(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate and complete
list of each Multiemployer Plan.

 

(f) With respect to each Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section
302 of ERISA or Sections 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code, except in each case,
as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
result in any material liability (i) there does not exist any accumulated
funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section
302 of ERISA, whether or not waived, (ii) no Benefit Plan is, or is expected
to be, in "at-risk" status (within the meaning of Section 303(i)(4)(A) of
ERISA or Section 430(i)(4)(A) of the Code), (iii) no "reportable event"
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for
which the thirty (30) day notice requirement has been waived under the
regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred, nor has any event
described in Sections 4062, 4063 or 4041 of ERISA occurred, (iv) all premiums
to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") have been timely
paid in full, (v) no unsatisfied liability (other than premiums to the PBGC)
under Title IV of ERISA has been, or is expected to be, incurred by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (vi) the PBGC has not instituted
proceedings to terminate any such Benefit Plan.

(g) As of the date of this Agreement, (A) there is no pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened litigation or claim (other than routine
claims for benefits) relating to the Benefit Plans and (B) there are no
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened administrative
investigations, audits or other administrative proceedings relating to the
Benefit Plans by the U.S. Department of Labor, the PBGC, the IRS or other
Governmental Entity that, in each of clauses (A) and (B) above, has resulted
in or would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
result in any material liability.

 



23 (h) Except as disclosed in Section 5.10(h) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, or except as required by applicable Law, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health, life or other
welfare benefits under any Benefit Plan or collective bargaining agreement.

 

(i) The Company does not have any commitment to establish, modify, change or
terminate any Benefit Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change
or termination required by ERISA or the Code, and there has been no amendment
to, announcement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or
change in employee participation or coverage under, any Benefit Plan which
would increase materially the expense of maintaining such plan above the level
of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year.

 

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, shareholder approval
of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will, either alone
or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or former
employees, directors or consultants of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to severance pay or any increase in severance pay, (ii) accelerate the time
of payment or vesting, or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or increase the amount
payable under any of the Benefit Plans, (iii) directly or indirectly cause
the Company to transfer or set aside any assets to fund benefits under any
Benefit Plan, (iv) limit or restrict the right of the Company or, after the
consummation of the Transactions, Parent to merge, amend, terminate
or transfer the assets of any of the Benefit Plans or (v) result in the
payment of any amount that could, individually or in combination with any
other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute payment" as defined
in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

(k) To the knowledge of the Company, except as would not reasonably be
expected to result in a material Tax or penalty, each Benefit Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A
of the Code) is in documentary compliance with, and has been operated and
administered in all material respects in compliance with, Section 409A of the
Code and the guidance issued by the IRS provided thereunder.

 

(l) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any obligation to provide, and
no Benefit Plan or other agreement provides any person with any amount of
additional compensation or gross-up if such individual is provided with
amounts subject to excise or additional taxes, interest or penalties incurred
pursuant to Sections 4999 or 409A of the Code or due to the failure of any
payment to be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

(m) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in any material liability, each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan (A)
has been maintained and operated in accordance with, and is in compliance
with, its terms, applicable local Law, government taxation and funding
requirements, and

 



24  with any agreement entered into with a works council, union or labor
organization in all material respects and (B) to the extent required to be
registered or approved by any Governmental Entity, has been registered with,
or approved by, such Governmental Entity and, to the Companys knowledge,
nothing has occurred that would adversely affect such registration or
approval. To the extent intended to be funded and/or book-reserved, each
Non-U.S. Benefit Plan is funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate, based
upon reasonable country-specific actuarial assumptions. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have no material unfunded liabilities with respect to any
such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened litigation or claim
relating to Non-U.S. Benefit Plans, except as would not reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, result in any material liability.

5.11. _Compliance with Laws; Investigations; Licenses; Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Since the 2011 Distribution Date, the businesses of each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have been and are being conducted in compliance in all
material respects with applicable federal, state, local or foreign law,
statute or ordinance, common law, or any rule, regulation, standard, judgment,
Order, writ, injunction, arbitration award, agency requirement, or decree
issued, promulgated or entered into by or with any Governmental Entity
(collectively, " _Laws_ "). No material audit (other than (x) audits in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in respect of
Government Contracts and (y) internal Company audits that, in the case of (x)
and (y), individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect), to the
knowledge of the Company, investigation (other than internal Company
investigations that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect), or
review by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor
has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same.

 

(b) (i) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has obtained and is in
compliance with all permits, licenses, certifications, approvals,
registrations, consents, authorizations, franchises, variances, exemptions and
orders issued or granted by a Governmental Entity (" _Licenses_ ") necessary
for it to own, lease or operate its properties, rights and other assets and
to conduct its business and operations as presently conducted in all material
respects and all such Licenses are in full force and effect in all material
respects. Section 5.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of each License that is issued or granted by the FCC
(each, an " _FCC License_ ") to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No
material default under, or material violation of, any FCC License or other
material License has occurred that has not been fully cured pursuant

 



25  to a corrective action. To the Companys knowledge there is not currently
threatened any revocation, adverse modification or cancellation of any FCC
License or other material License.

 

(c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with all statutory and regulatory requirements under the Arms Export
Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export
Administration Regulations and associated executive orders, and the Laws
implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, United States Department
of Treasury (collectively, and any successors or replacements thereof, the "
_Export Control Laws_ "). The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with the anti-boycott regulations
administered by the United States Department of Commerce and the U.S.
Department of Treasury, and all Laws and regulations administered by the
Bureau of Customs and Border Protection in the United States Department of
Homeland Security. To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any communication during the past five
years that alleges that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is not, or may
not be, in compliance with the Export Control Laws.

(d) (i) The Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives are
and since the 2011 Distribution Date have been in compliance in all material
respects with: (i) the provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977, as amended (15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1, _et_ _seq_.) (" _FCPA_ "), as if its
foreign payments provisions were fully applicable to the Company, its
Subsidiaries and such Representatives, and (ii) the provisions of all anti-
bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering Laws of each jurisdiction
in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate or have operated and in
which any agent thereof is conducting or has conducted business involving the
Company. No proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity involving the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives involving
FCPA or any anti-bribery, anti-corruption or anti-money laundering Law is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. Since the 2011
Distribution Date, no civil or criminal penalties have been imposed on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to violations of any
applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption or anti-money laundering law, nor
have any disclosures been submitted to any Governmental Entity with respect to
alleged violations of the FCPA or any anti-bribery, anti-corruption or anti-
money laundering Law.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a "Specially
Designated National" or other "Blocked Person" identified by the U.S.
Government, nor a Person that is owned or controlled by or acts on behalf of a
"Specially Designated National" or "Blocked Person." To the Companys
knowledge, none of the Companys affiliates or brokers or any director,
officer, employee, nor authorized agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, acting or benefiting in any capacity in connection with this
Agreement, and none of the funds or other assets to be transferred hereunder
are the property of, or beneficially owned

 



26  by, directly or indirectly, any "Specially Designated National" or "Blocked
Person." None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in or, to
the knowledge of the Company, facilitated any prohibited transactions with a
"Specially Designated National" or other "Blocked Person" without proper prior
authorization from the U.S. Government.

 

5.12. _Government Contracts_.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Major Company Government Contract_ "

Company Bid_ " means each current Government Bid over $100,000,000 to which
the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party, and for which an award has not
been issued as of the date of this Agreement. A current, accurate and complete
list as of the date hereof of all such Major Company Government Contracts and
Major Company Bids is set forth in Section 5.12(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, which list excludes indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity Contracts
(" _IDIQ Contracts_ ") that would be considered Major Company Government
Contracts or the subject of Major Company Bids solely due to such IDIQ
Contracts ceiling value. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Company
Government Contract_ " means each Government Contract with a value in excess
of $5,000,000 to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and
is in effect (i.e., has not completed performance and received final payment),
and " _Company Bid_ " means each current Government Bid over $5,000,000 to
which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party, and for which an award has
not been issued as of the date of this Agreement.

parties thereto, and is in full force and effect, and no Company Bid or
Company Government Contract is currently the subject of bid or award protest

with the terms and conditions of each Company Government Contract and Company
Bid as required, including all clauses, provisions and requirements
incorporated expressly by reference or by operation of Law therein.

and disclosures made by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to any
Company Government Contract or Company Bid were current, accurate and complete
at the time of disclosure, in each case in all material respects, as of their
effective date and (ii) neither the United States Government nor any prime
contractor, subcontractor or other Person has notified the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, in writing or, to the Companys knowledge, orally, that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has, or is alleged to have, breached or
violated in any material respect any Law, representation, certification,
disclosure, clause, provision or requirement pertaining to any Company
Government Contract and Company Bid.

 



27 (e) To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is subject to any notice of termination for convenience,
notice of termination for default, stop work order, material cure notice or
material show cause notice (or in the case of contracts governed by Laws other
than the state or federal Laws of the United States, or the functional
equivalents thereof, if any) pertaining to any Company Government Contract,
and no Governmental Entity has threatened to issue any such notice. To the
knowledge of the Company, since December 31, 2013, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice from any Governmental Entity
pertaining to any Company Government Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is party indicating that it intends to cancel or otherwise
adversely modify in any material respect its relationship with the Company or
its Subsidiaries, other than in a manner that would not materially adversely
impact such Company Government Contract.

 

(f) Since the 2011 Distribution Date, no material claim has been made against

criminal False Claims Act, federal or state fraud statutes (as such concept
is defined under the state or federal Laws of the United States).

(g) To the knowledge of the Company, there exist no outstanding material
asserted disputes, claims or written requests for equitable adjustment for an
amount in excess of $5,000,000 between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and either the U.S. Government or any prime contractor, subcontractor, vendor
or other Person arising under or relating to any Company Government Contract
or Company Bid.

(h) Since the 2011 Distribution Date, (x) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any material adverse or negative past performance
evaluations or ratings in connection with any Company Government Contract by
any Governmental Entity and, (y) to the knowledge of the Company, no facts
exist that would reasonably be expected to result in material adverse or
negative past performance evaluations or ratings by any Governmental Entity,
in each case of (x) and (y), that would make the Company or any of its

Agreement (excluding, in each case, any disclosures set forth in the risk
factors section or in the "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking

and each other section or subsection of this Agreement only to the extent that

authority; and each of Parent and Merger Sub possesses all governmental
licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals, necessary to enable it to use
its corporate or other name and to own, lease or otherwise hold, use
and operate its properties, rights and other assets and necessary to carry on
its business as currently conducted, except where the failure to be so
organized, existing, in good standing, qualified or licensed, individually or
in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (if and to the
extent such term is so recognized in such jurisdiction) in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of
its assets, properties or the conduct of its business makes such
qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, other than where the
failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing,

 



46  individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available
to the Company, prior to the date of this Agreement, true, correct and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Parent and

event, change, effect, development, state of facts, condition, circumstance or
occurrence that has a material adverse effect on the financial condition,
properties, assets, liabilities, business or results of operations of Parent
and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, taken as a whole; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that none of the following, or the direct results thereof, shall
constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect:

States;

in which Parent and its Subsidiaries operate; 

(iii) changes in United States GAAP or in any Law of general applicability
after the date of this Agreement;

 

(iv) a decline in the price, or a change in the trading volume, of the shares
of Parent Common Stock; ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the exception in
this clause (iv) shall not apply to the underlying causes giving rise to or
contributing to any such decline or change and shall not prevent any of such
underlying causes from being taken into account in determining whether a
Parent Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would be reasonably likely to
occur unless otherwise excluded pursuant to any of the other clauses of this
definition);

 

(v) the failure to meet internal or analysts expectations or projections for
results of operations ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the exception in this
clause (v) shall not apply to the underlying causes giving rise to or
contributing to any such failure and shall not prevent any of such underlying
causes from being taken into account in determining whether a Parent Material
Adverse Effect has occurred or would be reasonably likely to occur unless
otherwise excluded pursuant to any of the other clauses of this definition);

 

(vi) acts of war, insurrection, sabotage or terrorism (or the escalation of
the foregoing), or any weather-related or other force majeure event or
natural disaster;

(vii) the execution, delivery, announcement or pendency of this Agreement or

Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions); or

expressly required to comply with the terms of this Agreement ( _provided_
that the exception in this clause (viii) shall not apply to any obligation to
operate in the ordinary course of business or any similar provisions in the
Agreement);

 

 _provided_ _further_ that, with respect to clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (vi)
above, such event, change, effect, development, state of facts, condition,
circumstance or occurrence shall be taken into account to the extent it has a
disproportionately adverse effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, compared to other companies operating in the industry in which Parent
operates.

6.2. _Capitalization of Parent_. The authorized capital stock of Parent
consists of 500,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, par value $1.00, of

for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities
of Parent, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are
authorized, issued or outstanding. Parent does not have outstanding any bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations that give the holders thereof the right

securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of Parent on any
matter. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger will be,
when issued in accordance with the terms hereof, duly authorized and validly

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation of the Transactions and the Financing

affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and has identified for Parents auditors and audit committee of
the Parents board of directors any material weaknesses in internal control
over financial reporting and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal control over financial reporting. Parent has made available to
Company (1) a summary of any such disclosure made by management to the
Parents auditors and audit committee and (2) any material written
communication made by management or Parents auditors to the audit committee
since the 2011 Distribution Date required or contemplated by listing standards
of NYSE, the audit committees charter or professional standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board. Since January 1, 2013, no material
complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls
or auditing matters have been received by Parent. Parent has made available to
Company a summary of all material complaints relating to other matters made
through Parents whistleblower hot line or equivalent system for receipt of
employee concerns regarding possible violations of Law made since January 1,
2013.

 

(d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or obligation
of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, whether
known or unknown) whether or not required, if known, to be reflected or
reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of the Parent prepared in

 



51  accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, except liabilities (i) as
reflected, reserved for or disclosed in the most recent audited balance sheet
of the Parent included in the Parents most recent Form 10-K, as filed with
the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) as incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since July 2, 2014, (iii) as
incurred in connection with the Transactions or the Financing or (iv) that
have not had and would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to (x) have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (y) prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Transactions or the Financing. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any
joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract
(including any Contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or
any "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K promulgated by the SEC)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of
such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving,
or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in Parents or
such Subsidiarys published financial statements or other Parent Reports.

 

(e) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position
of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the
consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders equity
(deficit) and cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into the
Parent Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in
all material respects the results of operations, retained earnings (loss) and
changes in financial position, as the case may be, of such companies for the
periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
(1) notes consistent with past practice in kind and content and (2) normal
year-end audit adjustments not material in amount or effect), and each of the
foregoing financial statements (i) was prepared, or, in the case of Parent
Reports filed or furnished after the date of this Agreement, will be prepared,
in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except as may be noted therein and except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and (ii) complies in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto.

6.8. _Compliance with Laws_.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2013, the businesses of each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries have been and are being conducted in compliance in all material
respects with applicable Laws. No material audit (other than (x) audits in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in respect of
Government Contracts and (y) internal Company audits that, in the case of (x)
and (y),

 



52  individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect), to the knowledge of
Parent, investigation (other than internal Parent investigations that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect), or review by any
Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, nor has any
Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same.

 

(b) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has obtained and is in compliance with
all Licenses necessary for it to own, lease or operate its properties, rights
and other assets and to conduct its business and operations as presently
conducted in all material respects and all such Licenses are in full force and
effect in all material respects. No material default under, or material
violation of, any material License has occurred. To Parents knowledge there
is not currently threatened any revocation, adverse modification or
cancellation of any material License.

 

6.9. _Material Contracts_. Each "material contract" (as such term is defined
in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S K of the SEC) of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, a " _Parent Material Contract_ ") is valid and binding on
Parent and any of its Subsidiaries that is a party thereto and, to the
knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto and is in full force and
effect, except where the failure to be valid, binding and in full force and
effect, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There is no
default under any Parent Material Contract by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Parent, by any other party, and no event
has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would
constitute a default thereunder by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or to
the knowledge of Parent, by any other party, in each case except as,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

6.10. _Litigation_. There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions,
suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, audits (other than (x) audits in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in respect of
Government Contracts and (y) internal Company audits that, in the case of (x)
and (y), individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect), to the
knowledge of Parent, investigations (other than internal Parent investigations
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect) or other proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries except for those that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to (i) have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) as of the date of this Agreement, prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the
Transactions and the Financing. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is
a party to or subject to the provisions of any Order, except for those that,

 



53  individually or in the aggregate, have not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to (x) have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (y) as of the date of
this Agreement, prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of
Parent to consummate the Transactions and the Financing.

6.11. _Absence of Certain Changes_. Between July 2, 2014 and the date of this
Agreement, there has not been any event, change, effect, development, state of
facts, condition, circumstance or occurrence (including any adverse change
with respect to any event, change, effect, development, state of facts,
condition, circumstance or occurrence existing on or prior to July 2, 2014)
which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

6.12. _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied in writing by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the Form S-4, including the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
forming a part thereof, will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC
and at the time the Form S-4 becomes effective under the Securities
Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the
date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first mailed to the shareholders of the
Company and at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any
representation or warranty with respect to any information provided by or
required to be provided by the Company and/or by its auditors, legal counsel,
financial advisors or other consultants or advisors specifically for use in
the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

6.13. _Brokers and Finders_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor
or other Person, other than Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC, the fees and expenses
of which will be paid by Parent, is entitled to any brokers, finders or
other financial advisors fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent.

6.14. _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company (i) true, correct
and complete copies of the executed bridge facility commitment letter (the "
_Bridge Commitment Letter_ ") and unsecured term loan facility commitment
letter, each dated as of February 5, 2015 between Parent and Morgan
Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (together with all exhibits, annexes, schedules
and attachments thereto, the " _Financing Letters_ "), pursuant to which the
counterparties thereto have committed, subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, to lend to Parent, the amounts set forth therein (the " _Financing_
") and (ii) true and correct (subject to the redactions noted therein) copies
of the executed fee letters each, dated as of February 5, 2015 between Parent
and Morgan Stanley Senior

 



54  Funding, Inc. (the " _Fee Letters_ ") related to the Financing. As of the
date hereof, neither the Financing Letters nor the Fee Letters have been
amended or modified prior to the date hereof and, to the knowledge of Parent,
the commitments contained in the Financing Letters have not been withdrawn,
terminated or rescinded in any respect. If the conditions set forth in Section
8.2 have been satisfied or waived, at the Closing, the aggregate proceeds to
be disbursed pursuant to the Financing, together with available cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities of Parent and Merger Sub, in the
aggregate, will be sufficient to make the payment to the Exchange Agent of
the aggregate Per Share Consideration, all other amounts required to be paid
pursuant to Article IV and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Except for the Fee Letters, as of the date hereof, there are (i)
no side letters or other agreements or contracts related to the funding of
the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the applicable Financing
Letters or (ii) no arrangements related to the Financing that could adversely
affect the availability of the Financing. Parent has fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees required by such Financing Letters to be paid on
or prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, the Financing Letters are
in full force and effect and are the valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties to
the Financing Letters, in each case subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies relating
to the funding of the full amount of the Financing or any provisions that
could reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing other than as set forth in
the Financing Letters and the Fee Letters. Assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 5.5(e)
(Company Reports; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities), (i) no event
has occurred or circumstance exists which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach
on the part of Parent, or to the knowledge of Parent, any other party, under
the Financing Letters and the Fee Letters and (ii) Parent reasonably believes
that the conditions to the Financing contemplated in the Financing Letters
and the Fee Letters to be satisfied by Parent or Merger Sub will be satisfied,
at or prior to the time contemplated hereunder for the Closing; provided that
no representation or warranty is being made as to whether any of the
Companys representations or warranties are true or correct or whether the
Company has complied with its covenants contained in this Agreement.

 

6.15. _Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-
Looking Statements and Business Plans_. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub
have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plan information, regarding the Company and its business and
operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business
plans, with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger
Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to
them (including the reasonableness of the

 



55  assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-
looking information or business plans), and that Parent and Merger Sub will
have no claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any other
Person with respect thereto; _provided_ that the preceding shall have no
effect on any claims by Parent and Merger Sub against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in the event of fraud.

directly or indirectly:

(A) initiate, solicit, knowingly assist or knowingly encourage any inquiries

would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;

 

(B) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, acquisition

or other similar agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in Section 7.2(a)(ii) entered into in compliance with

with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action is
necessary in order for the directors to comply with their fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; or

(D) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, following the
receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that was made after the date hereof in
circumstances not otherwise involving a breach of this Agreement and prior to
the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company
may (A) provide information in response to a request therefor by a Person
that has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the
Company receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms not less restrictive to the other party
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (provided that any such
confidentiality agreement shall expressly permit the Company to provide copies
of forms of agreements in respect of such Acquisition Proposal to Parent and
its Representatives as contemplated in Section 7.2(e)) and promptly discloses
(and, if applicable, promptly provides copies of) any such information to
Parent to the extent not previously provided to Parent; (B) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person that has made
such an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal; and (C) after
having complied with Section 7.2(e), approve, recommend, or otherwise declare

otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x)
prior to taking any action described in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the
board of directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation
with its outside legal counsel that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary obligations under applicable Law,
(y) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the board of
directors of the Company has determined in good faith based on the information
then available and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and with
its financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal,
and (z) in the case referred to in clause (C) above, the board of directors of
the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and with its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal
is a Superior Proposal.

 



64 (b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal, offer or indication of interest
from any Person (other than Parent or its Affiliates) relating to any (i)
direct or indirect acquisition, purchase, lease, license, outsourcing,
exchange, transfer or other disposition, which if consummated would result in
any Person becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one
or a series of related transactions, 15% or more of the net revenues, net
income or the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
(ii) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company or any of its material
Subsidiaries, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any Person beneficially owning 15% or more of the voting power or
economic interest in any class of equity securities of the Company or any of
its material Subsidiaries, or (iv) merger, consolidation, business
combination, asset purchase, recapitalization or similar transaction involving
the Company, or any of its material Subsidiaries, other than the
Transactions, that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially
owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 

" _Intervening Event_ " means any event, change, effect, development, state of
facts, condition, circumstance or occurrence that was not known to, or
reasonably foreseeable by, the board of directors of the Company on the date
of this Agreement, and that becomes known to the board of directors of the
Company before the Requisite Company Vote; _provided_ , that in no event will
the receipt, existence of, or terms of any Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry relating thereto or any consequence thereof, constitute an Intervening
Event.

 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a written, unsolicited, fully financed and bona
fide Acquisition Proposal that would result in any Person (other than Parent
or its Affiliates) becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of
more than fifty percent (50%) of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or more
than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power of the equity securities
of the Company that the board of directors of the Company has determined in
its good faith judgment, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
with its financial advisor, is reasonably likely to be consummated
in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, financial and
regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, and if
consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys
shareholders from a financial point of view than the Transactions after
taking into account all relevant factors, including all terms and conditions
of such offer and this Agreement (including any revisions to the terms of the
Transactions contemplated by Section 7.2(e) and the time likely to be
required to consummate such Acquisition Proposal).

 



65 (c) _No Change of Recommendation_. Except as set forth in Section 7.2(d) and
Section 7.2(f), the board of directors of the Company and each committee of
the board of directors shall not:

intention to or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation;

(ii) fail to publicly affirm upon Parents request as promptly as practicable
(but in any event within five (5) business days after Parents request) after
a public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal (or if the Termination Date
or scheduled date of the Shareholders Meeting is less than five (5) business
days from the receipt of such request from Parent as promptly as practicable
following such request) (other than in the case of an Acquisition Proposal in
the form of a tender offer or exchange offer) the Company Recommendation
(provided that Parent may make such request only once in any seven (7)-day
period);

 

(iii) (A) fail to recommend unequivocally against acceptance of any tender
offer or exchange that is publicly disclosed (other than by Parent or an
Affiliate of Parent) prior to the earlier of (x) the day prior to the date of
the Shareholders Meeting and (y) the eleventh (11th) business day after the
commencement of such tender or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act or (B) recommend that the shareholders of the Company tender
their Shares in such tender offer or exchange offer; or

 

(iv) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus distributed to the Companys shareholders in connection
with the Shareholders Meeting;

(v) make any other public statement in connection with the Shareholder
Meeting that is inconsistent with the Company Recommendation; or

(vi) approve, adopt, recommend, or resolve or publicly propose to approve,
adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in Sections
7.2(c)(i) through 7.2(c)(vi) being referred to as a " _Change of
Recommendation_ ").

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement but
subject to Section 7.2(e), prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite
Company Vote is obtained, if an Acquisition Proposal has been made after the
date hereof, the board of directors of the Company may make a Change of
Recommendation in response to such Acquisition Proposal or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3(b) if, and only if, (i) such Acquisition
Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 7.2; and (ii) the board
of directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation with
its outside legal counsel

 



66  and with its financial advisor that (A) such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (B) in light of such Acquisition
Proposal, failure to make a Change of Recommendation or to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3(b) would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary obligations under applicable Law.

 

(e) Prior to making any Change of Recommendation in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal and prior to terminating this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.3(b) (to the extent permitted under Section 7.2(d)): the Company
shall deliver to Parent a written notice (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ")
stating that the board of directors of the Company intends to take such
action pursuant to Section 7.2(d) and, if applicable, intends to cause the
Company to enter into the Alternative Acquisition Agreement, a copy of the
proposed form of which shall be delivered with such notice, together with
copies of any related documents. During the four (4) business day period
commencing on the date of Parents receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice
(the " _Negotiation Period_ "), the Company shall have made its
Representatives reasonably available for the purpose of engaging in
negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding
a possible amendment of this Agreement so that the Acquisition Proposal that
is the subject of the Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a Superior
Proposal. Any written proposal made by Parent to amend this Agreement during
the Negotiation Period shall be considered by the board of directors of the
Company in good faith. Each time the financial or other material terms of
such Acquisition Proposal are amended, the Company shall be required to
deliver to Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice (including as attachments
thereto a copy of the new Alternative Acquisition Agreement relating to such
amended Acquisition Proposal and copies of any related documents), and the
Negotiation Period shall be extended by an additional two (2) business days
from the date of Parents receipt of such new Superior Proposal Notice. 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the
board of directors of the Company may make a Change of Recommendation in
response to an Intervening Event if, and only if, the board of directors of
the Company determines in good faith after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and with its financial advisor that a failure to make a Change
of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Company shall deliver to Parent a written notice stating
that the board of directors of the Company intends to take such action
pursuant to this Section 7.2(f) no less than four (4) business days prior to
making such Change of Recommendation.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth this Agreement, unless
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to, and in accordance with, Article IX,
(i) the obligation of the Company to establish a record date for, duly call,

 



67  give notice of, convene and hold the Shareholders Meeting and to hold a vote
of the Companys shareholders on the approval of this Agreement at the
Shareholders Meeting pursuant to Section 7.3 shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission
to it of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) or by a
Change of Recommendation, and (ii) in any case in which the Company makes a
Change of Recommendation pursuant to this Section 7.2, the Company shall
nevertheless submit this Agreement to a vote of its shareholders at the
Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of the approval of this Agreement.

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 7.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of the Company
if, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the Company
(after consultation with outside counsel), failure to make such disclosure
would reasonably be expected to violate U.S. federal or state securities Law
or its fiduciary obligations under Indiana Law; _provided_  that (x) if such
disclosure does not reaffirm the Company Recommendation, such disclosure shall
be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and (y) the board of directors of
the Company may not effect a Change of Recommendation unless permitted to do
so by this Section 7.2; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, any "stop, look and listen" disclosure in and of
itself shall not be considered a Change of Recommendation. 

(i) _Existing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers and other
Representatives to, immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with, or
any solicitation or intentional assistance or encouragement of, any Person, in
each case that may be ongoing with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or
entities referred to in the preceding sentence of the obligations in this
Section 7.2. The Company also agrees that it will promptly request each
Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement prior to the date hereof
in connection with its consideration of acquiring the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to return or destroy (as provided in the terms of such
confidentiality agreement) all confidential information furnished to such
Person prior to the date hereof by or on behalf of it or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable
best efforts to enforce any confidentiality agreements entered into with any
Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal if requested to do so by
Parent, subject to Section 7.2(a)(i)(C).

 

(j) _Notice_. Without limiting anything in this Section 7.2, the Company shall
promptly (and, in any event, within 48 hours) notify Parent orally and in
writing if any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition

 



68  Proposal are received by, any such information is requested from, or any
such discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with,
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if
applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements) and thereafter shall (x) keep Parent reasonably informed,
on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers
(including any material amendments thereto) and the status of any
such discussions or negotiations and (y) provide to Parent as soon as
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and
other written material sent or provided to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Person that describes any of the financial or other
material terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.

(k) The violation of any of the provisions of this Section 7.2 by any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or any of its or such Subsidiaries respective
Representatives shall constitute a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 

7.3. _Shareholders Meeting_. The Company will take, in accordance with
applicable Law and its articles of incorporation and by-laws, all action
necessary to establish a record date for, duly call and give notice of a
meeting of holders of Shares (the " _Shareholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective (and in no event more
than 45 calendar days after the Form S-4 becomes effective), and as promptly
as practicable convene and hold the Shareholders Meeting, to consider and
vote upon the approval of this Agreement (and if such meeting is an annual
meeting of the Company and not a special meeting, such other customary matters
as may be appropriate for an annual meeting of shareholders of the Company),
cause such vote to be taken and completed as soon as practicable and shall
not postpone or adjourn such meeting except to the extent required by Law or
with the prior written consent of Parent. Subject to Section 7.2(d), Section
7.2(e) and Section 7.2(f) hereof, the board of directors of the Company shall
recommend such approval, include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and
solicit such approval of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on
a date within two (2) business days of the date the Shareholders Meeting is
scheduled (the " _Original Date_ "), (A) the Company has not received proxies
representing the Requisite Company Vote, whether or not a quorum is present
or (B) it is necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is timely provided to the Companys shareholders, the Company may,
or if Parent so requests, shall, postpone or adjourn, or make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of, the Shareholders Meeting as long
as the date of the Shareholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned more
than ten (10) calendar days in connection with any one postponement or
adjournment or more than an aggregate of twenty (20) calendar days from the
Original Date in reliance on the preceding sentence. The Company shall (i)
keep Parent reasonably updated concerning proxy solicitation results on a
timely basis (including, if requested by Parent, promptly providing daily
voting reports) and (ii) provide written

 



69  notice to Parent on the day preceding the Shareholders Meeting and on the
day of, but prior to the Shareholders Meeting, indicating whether as of such
date sufficient proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote have been
obtained.

7.4. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

 

(a) _Form S-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus_. As promptly as practicable
after the execution of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall jointly
prepare and Parent shall file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus. Each of the Company and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the Form S-4 to
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (ii) to promptly notify the other
of, cooperate with each other with respect to, and respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff, (iii) have the Form S-4 declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, (iv)
cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Companys
shareholders as promptly as practicable after such declaration of
effectiveness and (v) to keep the Form S-4 effective through the Closing in
order to permit the consummation of the Transactions. Each party shall furnish
all information as may be reasonably requested by the other party in
connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. No filing,
amendment, supplement or distribution of the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will be made without provision to Parent and the Company
of a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent,
or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Form S-4 so that such document would not include any
misstatement of material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be included therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly prepared by the party to which such amended or supplemented
disclosure relates and, to the extent required by applicable Law, filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company. Parent shall
notify the Company promptly of the time when the Form S-4 has become
effective, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of
the qualification of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection
with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. The parties shall
notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the
staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or for additional information and shall
supply each other with copies of (A) all correspondence between it or any of
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Form S-4 or
the Merger and (B) all orders of the SEC relating to the Form S-4.

 



70 (b) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable
Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions prior to the
Termination Date, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable
all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings
(including by filing no later than 20 calendar days after the date of this
Agreement all applications required to be filed with the FCC and the
notification and report form required under the HSR Act) and obtaining all
consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods
and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental
Entity in order to consummate the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall
require Parent to propose, negotiate, commit to, consent to, or effect, by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, transfer,
license, lease, divestiture, disposition or any other encumbrance of any
assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest
therein of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, other
than, to the extent required to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section
8.1(b) and 8.1(c) prior to the Termination Date, the sale, transfer, license,
lease, divestiture, disposition or other encumbrance of the Companys tactical
communications systems business units operations to the extent involving
sales to the U.S. Department of Defense. The Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not agree to any actions, restrictions or conditions with respect to
obtaining any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations
from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions without the
prior written consent of Parent (which, subject to this Section 7.4(b), may be
withheld in Parents sole discretion). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, if requested by Parent in writing, the Company
shall take or agree to take any of the actions referred to above if they are
effective only after the Effective Time. Subject to applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information, it is agreed that Parent, after consulting
with the Company and considering the Companys views in good faith, shall make
all decisions, lead all discussions, negotiations and other proceedings, and
coordinate all activities with respect to any requests that may be made by,
or any actions, consents, undertakings, approvals, or waivers that may be
sought by or from, any Governmental Entity, including determining the manner
in which to contest or otherwise respond, by litigation or otherwise, to
objections to, or proceedings or other actions challenging, the consummation
of the Transactions by any Governmental Entity. At Parents request, the
Company agrees to assist Parent in litigating or otherwise contesting any
objections to or proceedings or other actions challenging, the consummation of
the Transactions by any Governmental Entity. In exercising the foregoing
rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly
as practicable.

 



71 (c) _Information_. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by
the other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors and officers and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Form S-4 and the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Transactions.

 

(d) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and except as prohibited by any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the Transactions,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
material communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions. Each of the Company and
Parent shall promptly notify the other of (i) any proceeding, or to the
knowledge of the Company or Parent, as applicable, investigation, commenced
or, to its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to any of
such partys representations or warranties, as the case may be, and (ii) the
occurrence of any event which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would be reasonably likely to (A) have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (in
the case of Parents notification obligation) or a Company Material Adverse
Effect (in the case of the Companys notification obligation) or (B) result
in the failure of any condition to the Merger set forth in Article VIII to be
satisfied; _provided_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
7.4(d) shall not (x) affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by any party herein or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties hereto under this Agreement or (y) update any section of the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter. Neither party nor any of
its Representatives shall participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to
the Transactions (except, in the case of such inquiries, to the extent
arising as a result of a partys business relationship pursuant to a
Government Contract with such Governmental Entity and that do not relate to
any potential Consent or Restraining Order) unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

(e)  _Other Cooperation_. To the extent reasonably requested by Parent, the
Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in Parents efforts to obtain,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, any Consents necessary
or 

 



72  advisable to be obtained from any third party (excluding for the purposes of
this Section 7.4(e), any Governmental Entity) in connection with the
Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, actually obtaining such Consents
shall not be a condition to the Closing.

7.5. _Access and Reports_. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier
of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, and in each case (X) subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, (Y)
subject to applicable Law, and (Z) for purposes of furthering the
Transactions (including integration matters) or for purposes of obtaining
additional information relating to the ongoing operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or developments in the businesses of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to) (a) afford Parents officers and other authorized
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to its
employees, properties, assets, books, contracts, Tax Returns, and records
and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to) furnish reasonably promptly to Parent all information concerning its
business, properties, finances, operations, assets, liabilities, litigation
matters, environmental matters, cash-flow reports and personnel as may
reasonably be requested and (b) from time to time, provide an updated version
of Section 5.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter with respect to the number
of outstanding Company Options, Company Restricted Stock and Company RSUs, as
of the date of request by Parent or such other date as may be specified by
Parent; _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto
under this Agreement or update any section of the Company Disclosure Letter; 
_provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i)
to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable good faith judgment of the Company (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of
third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to
obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure, (ii)
to disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries ( _provided_ that the Company and Parent will utilize a joint
defense agreement or implement such other techniques if doing so would
reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without jeopardizing such
privilege) or (iii) undertake or permit to be undertaken any invasive or
subsurface investigations of any properties or facilities. With respect to
each Benefit Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) deliver or
make available to Parent a copy of all material documents received by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries during the twelve (12) month period prior
to the date of this Agreement from the sponsor of such Multiemployer Plan (or
its authorized representative) and (ii) provide the estimated aggregate
withdrawal liability of the Company and its Subsidiaries for each
Multiemployer Plan as most recently communicated to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in writing by the sponsor of such Multiemployer Plan (or its
authorized representative). As soon as reasonably practicable after the date
of this Agreement, the

 



73  Company shall deliver to Parent copies of calculations with respect to
Section 280G of the Code (whether or not final) with respect to any
disqualified individual who is a Band A or Band B executive in connection
with the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver or
make available to Parent a copy of all (1) material correspondence to or from
any Governmental Entity regarding any Benefit Plan received in the last three
years relating to any material controversy, audit, amnesty, voluntary
compliance, self correction or other material matter and (2) any of the items
listed in Section 5.10(b) not delivered or made available to Parent as of the
date of the Agreement. All such information shall be governed by the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

7.6. _NYSE Listing; NYSE Delisting_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
to be approved for listing on the NYSE prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Laws and rules and policies of NYSE to enable the delisting by the
Surviving Corporation of the Shares from NYSE and the deregistration of the
Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, and in any event no more than ten (10) days after the Closing Date. The
Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Shares to no longer be quoted on NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

7.7. _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Transactions shall
be a joint press release by the Company and Parent. Thereafter, the Company
and Parent shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases
or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Transactions and
prior to making any filings with any Governmental Entity (including any
national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the Company shall
be prohibited from making such disclosure to the extent that such party shall
have reasonably determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that such disclosure without prior consultation is required
by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any applicable national securities exchange or interdealer quotation
service or by the request of any Governmental Entity; provided further,
however, that such prior consultation shall not be required with respect to
press releases or public announcements that have substantially identical
content to prior press releases or public announcements that have been the
subject of consultations pursuant to this Section 7.7.

7.8. _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on December 31 of the year in which the Effective Time occurs, the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately before the

 



74  Effective Time (the " _Company Employees_ ") continuing after the Effective
Time will be provided with (1) annual base salary or base wage rate, (2)
annual target cash incentive opportunities and (3) employee pension and
welfare benefits (excluding equity and long-term incentive compensation and
benefits under any defined benefit pension plan) under employee benefit plans,
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries to such Company Employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time; provided that the requirements of this sentence shall not
apply to Company Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining
agreement, and provided further that Parent shall not, and shall not permit
the Company or any other Affiliate of the Parent to, amend the Exelis Salaried
Retirement Plan to cause any reduction of benefit accruals to
occur thereunder prior to December 31, 2016 (unless Xylem Inc. and ITT
Corporation provide written consent to any such amendment).

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume and honor the
employee benefit obligations to current and former employees under the
Benefit Plans set forth on Section 7.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
subject to the rights of amendment or termination provided therein.

 

(c) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause any employee
benefit plans in which the Company Employees are entitled to participate
after the Effective Time to take into account, for purposes of eligibility and
vesting thereunder (other than with respect to the accrual of benefits under
any defined benefit pension plan of Parent or any frozen employee benefit
plans of Parent and other than to the extent it would result in a duplication
of benefits for the same period of service), service by the Company Employees
as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent such service was
credited under a comparable plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii)
cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting
periods under any group health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived
with respect to the Company Employees and their eligible dependents, except
to the extent such pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility
waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under a comparable
plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (iii) give each Company Employee
credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable
deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred
prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been made, and (iv) cause
any evidence of insurability requirement under any group life insurance plan
and any group long term disability plan of Parent or its Affiliates to be
waived with respect to Company Employees at the time that the
Company Employees initially become eligible for coverage under such plans
(the " _Welfare Integration Date_ "), except to the extent that any such
Company Employee may be required to provide evidence of insurability under the
group life insurance plan or group long term disability plan of the Company
in which such Company Employee participates immediately prior to the Welfare
Integration Date, and provided that the election of such coverage under the
group life insurance plan and group long term disability plan of Parent or
its Affiliates on the Welfare

 



75  Integration Date does not exceed the level of such coverage in effect for
such employee under the respective plan of the Company immediately prior to
the Welfare Integration Date.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, each long-term cash incentive award grant under the
Stock Plans (" _Company TSR Award_ ") that remains outstanding and unpaid as
of the Effective Time shall vest in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Stock Plan and award agreement, and shall be paid in cash, without
interest and less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment, at the time or times provided under the terms of such Company
TSR Award.

 

(e) If requested by Parent in writing at least seven (7) business days before
the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms
of the applicable plan or arrangement, the Company shall cause to be amended
the employee benefit plans and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the
extent necessary to provide that no employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries
shall commence participation therein following the Effective Time unless the
Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such
participation.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (1) be
treated as an amendment or modification of any particular Benefit Plan, (2)
give any third party any right with respect to the compensation, terms and
conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Company
Employee by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates or
under any benefit plan which Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates may maintain or (3) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Affiliates from (i) amending, modifying or terminating any
Benefit Plan or (ii) terminating the employment of any Company Employee at any
time for any or no reason.

7.9. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.4(b), whether or
not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring
such expense, except that expenses incurred in connection with the filing fee
for the Form S-4 and printing and mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall
be shared equally by Parent and the Company.

 

7.10. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and
severally, shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director
and officer appointed by the Companys board of directors (or equivalent
fiduciaries) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, determined as of the
Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred by such individual in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or

 



76  investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
permitted under applicable Law and its articles of incorporation or by-laws in
effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such individual (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the individual
to whom expenses are advanced provides the undertaking required by applicable
Law to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that
such individual is not entitled to indemnification).

(b) For a period of no less than six years from the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, contain in the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation, provisions no less favorable (individually and in the
aggregate) with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses of directors, officers and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as the provisions of the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries
respective articles of incorporation, by-laws (or comparable organizational
documents) in effect on the date hereof, except as may be required by
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any Proceeding
pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until
the final disposition of such proceeding.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain (and, in either case, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to keep in effect thereafter) "tail" (A) directors and officers
liability insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect
to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with benefits and levels of
coverage at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company expend for such insurance
policies an aggregate amount in excess of 200% of the annual premium amount
paid by the Company for the Companys DandO Insurance during the most recently
completed fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement and (B) fiduciary
insurance policies with a claims period of at least three (3) years from and
after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to
fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _Fiduciary Insurance_ ") with
benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Companys
existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company
expend for

 



77  such insurance policies an aggregate amount in excess of 500% of the annual
premium amount paid by the Company for the Companys Fiduciary Insurance
during the most recently completed fiscal year prior to the date of this
Agreement. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to
obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
continue to maintain in effect (A) for a period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement,
or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period
with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation
be required to expend for such insurance policies an aggregate amount in
excess of 200% of the annual premium amount paid by the Company for the
Companys DandO Insurance during the most recently completed fiscal year prior
to the date of this Agreement; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
aggregate amount payable for of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount,
the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount and (B) for a period of at
least three (3) years from and after the Effective Time the Fiduciary
Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with benefits and levels
of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable
Fiduciary Insurance for such three-year period with benefits and levels of
coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies
as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for
such insurance policies an aggregate amount in excess of 500% of the annual
premium amount paid by the Company for the Companys Fiduciary Insurance
during the most recently completed fiscal year prior to the date of this
Agreement; and,  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the aggregate amount
payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation or the
properties and assets thereof shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.10.

 



78 (e) The obligations under this Section 7.10 shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in such manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs, and his or her representatives, without
the prior written consent of such affected Person. The provisions of this
Section 7.10 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs, and his or her
representatives from and after the Effective Time and (ii) in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such Person may have under the articles of incorporation, by-laws or
other equivalent organizational documents, any and all agreements of or
entered into by Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law
(whether at law or in equity). The provisions of this Section 7.10 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger.

 

7.11. _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law is or may become applicable to the
Transactions, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and their respective boards
of directors shall grant such approvals and take all such actions as are
necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
Transactions.

7.12. _Litigation_. The Company shall reasonably promptly provide Parent with
notice of, and copies of all pleadings and material non-privileged
correspondence relating to, any civil, criminal or administrative actions,
suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings
against the Company or any of its directors or officers arising out of or
relating to the Transactions (a " _Transaction Proceeding_ "); _provided_ that
the Company and Parent will utilize a joint defense agreement or implement
such other techniques if doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of
privileged information without jeopardizing such privilege. The Company shall
keep Parent apprised on a continuous basis of all other material developments
with respect to all Transaction Proceedings. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement, or compromise of
each Transaction Proceeding. No settlement or compromise in respect thereof
shall be offered, proposed or agreed to without the prior written consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) except as set
forth on Section 7.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

7.13. _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange
and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Letters (as may be amended in accordance with the terms below),
and shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Financing Letters or the Fee
Letters, if such amendment, modification or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Financing or (ii) imposes new or

 



79  additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expands, amends or
modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing or other terms
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) delay or prevent the
Closing, (y) make the timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Financing materially less likely to occur or (z)
adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against any
other party to the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect
thereto, other than, in each case, (i) a waiver of any closing conditions by
lender(s) or their agent or (ii) to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Financing
Letters as of the date hereof or to reassign titles to such parties who had
executed the Financing Letters as of the date hereof; _provided_ , that
Parent shall have the right to substitute other financing for all or any
portion of the Financing from the same and/or alternative Financing Sources;
_provided_ _further_ , that such substitution shall only be permitted if (i)
the terms thereof would not be reasonably expected to delay or prevent the
Closing or make the timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Financing materially less likely to occur, and
(ii) the conditions to the Financing set forth in the Financing Letters would
not be expanded or modified in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
delay or prevent the Closing, _provided_ _still_ _further_ , that any such
substitute financing shall not obligate the Company prior to the Closing as a
surety, guarantor or indemnitor or require the Company to extend credit to any
Person. Any reference in this Agreement to: (A) "Financing," shall include the
financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as amended or modified in
compliance with this Section 7.13(a), and (B) "Financing Letters" and "Fee
Letters" shall include such documents as amended or modified in compliance
with this Section 7.13(a). " _Financing Sources_ " are the Persons (other
than Parent or any of its Affiliates) that are committed to provide (directly
or indirectly), or otherwise entered into agreements that are in full force
and effect in connection with, the Financing or other financings in
connection with the Transactions, including the Persons party to the Financing
Letters and any joinder agreements or credit agreements relating thereto,
together with their respective shareholders, Affiliates and Representatives
and their successors and assigns.

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts (i) to arrange and
consummate the Financing in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Financing Letters, (ii) to negotiate and enter into all
definitive agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms and
conditions contained in the Financing Letters, (iii) to comply with its
obligations under the Financing Letters and, in the event of a failure to fund
by the Financing Sources in accordance therewith that prevents, impedes or
delays closing of the Merger, to enforce its rights under the Financing
Letters, (iv) to satisfy, or cause to be satisfied, on a timely basis, all
conditions to such definitive agreements, to cause the parties providing
Financing to meet their obligations under such definitive agreements and to
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing to the extent the proceeds
thereof are needed to make the payment to the Exchange Agent of the aggregate
Per Share Consideration 

 



80  and to pay all other amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article IV and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (v) to consummate
the Financing at or prior to Closing (it being understood that this clause
(b) shall not prevent the Parent from substituting other financing for all or
a portion of the Financing in accordance with clause (a) above). Parent shall
keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of the Financing and
developments with respect thereto and shall, upon the request of the Company,
provide to the Company copies of all material definitive documents related to
the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event within three (3)
business days, if at any time (A) the Financing Letters shall expire or be
terminated for any reason, (B) any of the other parties to the
Financing Letters notify Parent that such party no longer intends to provide
financing on the terms set forth therein, (C) Parent is in breach or default
of its obligations under the Financing Letters or (D) to Parents knowledge
(without a requirement of due inquiry), any of the other parties to the
Financing Letters are or are alleged to be in breach or default thereunder.
Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, (a) issue
or sell any debt securities, incur debt for borrowed money or issue any
equity securities, equity-linked securities or other securities, in each case,
the effect of which is to reduce the Commitments (as defined in the Bridge
Commitment Letter) or any other Financing unless the proceeds are placed in
an escrow account or other segregated account and only released (i) to make
(in whole or in part) the payment to the Exchange Agent of the aggregate Per
Share Consideration and pay (in whole or in part) other amounts required to
be paid pursuant to Article IV and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) after the payment of the aggregate Per Share Consideration to
the Exchange Agent and all other amounts required to be paid pursuant
to Article IV and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
(iii) upon or following the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article IX (clauses (i)-(iii), the " _Specified Release_ "), (b) obtain
commitments for, or obtain loans under, any term loan facility or term bank
debt the effect of which is to reduce the Commitments (as defined in the
Bridge Commitment Letter) unless (i) the purpose of such loans is solely
to make the payment to the Exchange Agent of the aggregate Per Share
Consideration or pay the other amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article
IV and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the
conditions to availability of such facility are (A) no more restrictive than
the conditions to the availability of the Facility (as defined in the Bridge
Commitment Letter) and (B) to the extent the conditions to the availability of
such facility are not identical to those set forth in the Bridge Commitment
Letter, not reasonably expected to delay or prevent the Closing, (iii) all
lenders providing debt commitments thereunder are Investment Grade Lenders (as
defined in the Bridge Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof);
provided, that a lender providing such debt commitments thereunder may be a
non-Investment Grade Lender (as defined in the Bridge Commitment Letter as in
effect on the date hereof) if, and only if, an Investment Grade Lender is
obligated to fund any and all commitments of such non-Investment Grade Lender
(as defined in the Bridge Commitment Letter as in effect on the date

 



81  hereof) if such non-Investment Grade Lender (as defined in the Bridge
Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof) fails to fund such
commitment on or prior to the Closing Date and (iv) any proceeds from any
such facility received prior to the Closing are placed in an escrow account or
other segregated account only released to make a Specified Release; or (c)
consummate any sale or disposition of assets the effect of which is to reduce
the Commitments (as defined in the Bridge Commitment Letter) unless the
proceeds are placed in an escrow account or other segregated account and only
released to make a Specified Release.

 

(c) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Financing Letters (other than as a result of
obtaining substitute debt financing in accordance with Section 7.13(a)) and
such portion is reasonably required to make the payment to the Exchange Agent
of the aggregate Per Share Consideration, all other amounts required to be
paid pursuant to Article IV and the other Transactions (such event, an "
_Original Financing Failure_ "), Parent shall promptly notify the Company in
writing of the Original Financing Failure and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange as promptly as practicable to obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions not materially less
favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent than those contained in the
Financing Letters and the Fee Letters and in an amount, when added with cash
and marketable securities of Merger Sub and Parent, at least equal to the
Financing or such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the "
_Alternate Financing_ "), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter
with respect to such Alternate Financing (the " _New Financing Letter_ "),
which shall replace the existing Financing Letters; _provided_ that any such
Alternate Financing shall not obligate the Company prior to the Closing as a
surety, guarantor or indemnitor or be required to extend credit to any Person.
Parent shall promptly provide a true, correct and complete copy of such New
Financing Letter to the Company. In the event any New Financing Letter is
obtained, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" shall mean
the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as modified pursuant to
clause (ii) below, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing
Letter" shall be deemed to include the Financing Letters that are not
superseded by a New Financing Letter at the time in question and the New
Financing Letter to the extent then in effect and (iii) any reference in this
Agreement to the "Fee Letters" shall be deemed to include any fee or other
letter relating to the Financing Letters that is not superseded by a New
Financing Letter at the time in question and the New Financing Letter to the
extent then in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, with the written consent of the Company, Parent shall be
entitled to pursue substitute financing, the terms of which may differ from
the terms set forth in the Financing Letters and such substitute financing may
not constitute Alternate Financing. No actions taken by Parent, its Affiliates
or their respective Representatives in connection therewith shall in and of
itself constitute a breach of the obligations of Parent under this Agreement.

 



82 (d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use, and cause its Subsidiaries
to use their, reasonable best efforts, at Parents sole expense, to cooperate
with Parent as necessary in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
as may be reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries), including to (A) participate at reasonable
times in a reasonable number of meetings, drafting sessions, presentations,
road shows, rating agency presentations and due diligence sessions, (B)
assist Parent and its Financing Sources in the preparation of (i) offering
documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents for any portion of such Financing and (ii)
materials for rating agency presentations, (C) cooperate with the marketing
efforts of Parent and its Financing Sources for any portion of such Financing,
(D) use reasonable best efforts to cause their independent accountants and
local and internal counsel to provide customary and reasonable assistance to
Parent including in connection with providing customary review of interim
financial statements as provided in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100,
comfort letters and opinions of counsel, (E) provide information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries required by regulatory authorities under
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act of 2001, (F) provide (i)
audited consolidated annual balance sheets and related statements of income,
comprehensive income and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
the last three full fiscal years ended at least 60 days prior to the Closing
Date (it being agreed that the Company has provided such financial statements
with respect to the fiscal years ended on or prior to December 31, 2013), and
(ii) unaudited interim consolidated balance sheets and related statements of
income, comprehensive income and cash flows of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (which shall have been reviewed by the independent accountants
for the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in Statement on Auditing
Standards No. 100) for each subsequent fiscal quarterly interim period or
periods ended at least 40 days prior to the Closing Date (and the
corresponding period(s) of the prior fiscal year, which in each case of
subclauses (F)(i) and (ii) are prepared in accordance with GAAP) (it being
understood that, with respect to such financial information for each such
fiscal year and subsequent interim period, such condition shall be deemed
satisfied through the filing by the Company of its annual report on Form 10-K
or quarterly report on Form 10-Q with respect to such fiscal year or interim
period), and (G) assist Parent in obtaining surveys and title insurance as
reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ , in each case, that (1) none of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to incur any
liability in connection with such financing that is not contingent on
the Closing, except such expenses for which Parent is obligated to reimburse
the Company, (2) the pre-Closing board of directors of the Company and the
directors, managers and general partners of the Companys Subsidiaries shall
not be required to adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and
instruments pursuant to which such financing is obtained, (3) none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to execute prior to the
Closing any definitive financing documents (other than customary

(f) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this Section 9.5 are an integral part of the Transactions, and
that, without these agreements, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to
promptly pay any applicable amount due pursuant to this Section 9.5, and, in
order to obtain such payment, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the Company or Parent (as applicable)
for the fee set forth in this Section 9.5 or any portion of such fee, the
Company or Parent shall pay to Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (as

acknowledge that in the event that the Termination Fee or the Reverse
Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid in full by the applicable party
pursuant

 



91  to this Section 9.5, then the Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination
Fee, as applicable, shall be the Companys or Parents and Merger Subs sole
and exclusive remedy for monetary damages under this Agreement.

(g) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Reverse
Termination Fee and the Termination Fee are not intended to be penalties, but
rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such fee
is due and payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement on
the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

10.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any annexes or exhibits
hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated December 4, 2014, between Parent and the
Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") constitute the entire agreement
and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof; provided that Section 7 of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate and be without further force and effect from and
after the date of this Agreement. No party shall be bound by, or be liable
for, any alleged representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention
not contained herein or therein.

 

10.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 7.10
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) only and pursuant to
the last sentence of this Section 10.8, Parent and the Company hereby agree
that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth
herein are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance
with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not
intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon
the representations and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto
further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 7.10
shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 10.3
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date hereof or as of any other date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 10.8, each of this Section 10.8, and
Sections 10.2 and 10.5 are intended to benefit, and be enforceable by, the
Financing Sources and their stockholders, partners and members.

10.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any 

 



96  action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the
part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after
the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action.

10.10. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub
when due, and Parent and Merger Sub will indemnify the Company against
liability for any such Taxes.

10.11. _Definitions_. For the convenience of the parties hereto, each of the
terms set forth in Annex A is defined in the Section of this Agreement set
forth opposite such term.

10.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

10.13. _Interpretation; Construction_. The table of contents and headings
herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the
provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to an Article,
Section, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article, Section,
Annex of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation" or words of
like import. The use of the masculine, feminine or neuter gender, or the
singular or plural form of words used herein (including defined terms) shall
not limit any provision of this Agreement. Reference herein to a particular
Person includes such Persons successors and assigns to the extent such
successors and assigns are permitted by the terms of any applicable Contract.
Reference to a particular Contract (including this Agreement), document or
instrument means such Contract, document or instrument as amended or modified
and in effect from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof. Any
reference to a particular Law means such Law as amended, modified or
supplemented (including all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) and,
unless otherwise provided, as in effect from time to time. The terms "cash"
and "$" mean United States Dollars. The use of the terms "hereunder,"
"hereof," "hereto" and words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular Article, Section, paragraph or clause
of, or Annex to, this Agreement. The term "made available"

 



97  and words of similar import shall refer to availability in hard copy or
electronic formats, including (X) as attachments to emails to a partys
outside corporate counsel and (Y) in virtual datarooms, _provided_ that, in
the case of availability in virtual datarooms, any such files or documents
were made available at least 12 hours prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, and _provided_ _further_ , that if the applicable party or
its representatives (other than counsel to the Financing Sources) accessed
such files or documents in a virtual dataroom within such 12-hour period, such
files or documents shall be deemed to have been made available. For purposes
of this Agreement, " _knowledge_ " means (a) with respect to the Company, the
actual knowledge after reasonable inquiry of the individuals set forth in
Section 10.13 of the Company Disclosure Letter and (b) with respect to
Parent, the actual knowledge after reasonable inquiry of the individuals set
forth in Section 10.13 of the Parent Disclosure Letter ( _provided_ that for
the avoidance of doubt, such reasonable inquiry shall not be construed to
include communications with individuals who were not informed of the potential
Transactions by management of the applicable party prior to the date hereof).
For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Transactions_ " means the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, excluding the
Financing.

(a) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

(b) Each party to this Agreement has or may have set forth information in its
respective Disclosure Letter in a section of such Disclosure Letter that
corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this
Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to
be disclosed by this Agreement.

 

10.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
Law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by
written notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect
Subsidiary to be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which
event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to
such other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made
herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be
deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other
Subsidiary as of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such
designation shall not impede or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise impede the rights of the
shareholders of the Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in
violation of this Agreement is void.

 



98 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the date first written
above.
