 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of April 27,
2011, among Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation, a company formed under the
laws of Japan (" _Parent_ "), Magenta Corporation, a Minnesota corporation and
a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Vital
Images, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the " _Company_ "). Capitalized terms
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in _Exhibit A_
attached hereto.

 



 

 **Recitals**

 



 

A. The boards of directors (or similar governing body) (" _Board of Directors_
") of Parent and Merger Sub have approved and declared advisable this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

B. The Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (a) determined that
this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer, the Merger and the
Top-Up Option, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders; (b) approved and declared advisable this Agreement (including
the Plan of Merger) and the Transactions, including the Offer, the Merger and
the Top-Up Option, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement; and (c) resolved to recommend that the shareholders of the
Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer and, to
the extent required by applicable Law, approve the Merger and adopt the Plan
of Merger.

 



 

C. Parent, as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, has, by resolution duly
adopted, approved this Agreement and the Merger as contemplated by the MBCA.

 



 

D. In furtherance of such acquisition, Parent has agreed to cause Merger Sub
to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as
permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding (each share of Company Common Stock, a "
_Share_ " and, collectively, the " _Shares_ "), at a price per Share of
$18.75, net to the seller in cash (such amount, or any higher amount per Share
paid pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer
Price_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

E. Following consummation of the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to merge with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly
owned, direct subsidiary of Parent, in accordance with the Minnesota Business
Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ "). Each Share that is not tendered and accepted
pursuant to the Offer, other than certain Shares as provided in _Section
2.5(a)(ii)_ and _Section 2.6_, will thereupon be cancelled and converted in
the Merger into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer
Price on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

 



 

F. In consideration of the foregoing and of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE 1 
THE OFFER

 



 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section 8.1_ hereof and provided further that the Company is prepared
(in accordance with _Section 1.2(c)_) to file the Schedule 14D-9 on the same
date as Merger Sub commences the Offer, as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof (and in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after the
date of initial public announcement of this Agreement), Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
of the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase any and all of the outstanding
Shares at the Offer Price. The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment
and pay for any Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer shall be subject to the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ and no other
conditions (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The Company agrees that no Shares
held by any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

 



 

(b) Merger Sub, or Parent on behalf of Merger Sub, expressly reserves the
right to waive, in its sole discretion, in whole or in part, any of the Offer
Conditions and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer;
provided that, unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or previously
approved by the Company in writing (which approval may be granted or withheld
by the Company in its sole discretion), Merger Sub, and Parent on behalf of
Merger Sub, shall not, subject to applicable Law, (i) decrease the Offer
Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii)
decrease the number of Shares sought in the Offer, (iv) impose conditions to
the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (v) amend or modify any of the
Offer Conditions in a manner that adversely affects the holders of Shares,
(vi) change or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, or (vii) extend or
otherwise change the Expiration Date other than as required or permitted by
this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless the Offer is
extended in accordance with this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at
midnight, New York City time, on the date that is twenty (20) business days
(calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following
the commencement of the Offer (such time, the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ,"
and such time, or such subsequent time to which the expiration of the Offer is
extended in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_,

 



 

(i) if on any then-scheduled Expiration Date (A) the Minimum Tender Condition
or any of the Offer Conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of _Annex A_ shall
not have been satisfied (and, to the extent permitted, shall not have been
waived by Parent) or (B) any of the other Offer Conditions shall have occurred
and be continuing (and, to the extent permitted, shall not have been waived by
Parent), then Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) may, in its sole
discretion, but without limiting Merger Subs and Parents obligations under
clause (ii) of this _Section 1.1(c)_, extend the Offer on one or more
occasions, in consecutive increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each, up
to and including the Outside Date, the length of each

 



      
 

 



 

such period to be determined by Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) in its
sole discretion, until such Expiration Date on which all of the Offer
Conditions shall have been satisfied or shall no longer be continuing (as the
case may be) or, to the extent permitted, shall have been waived by Parent;
and

 



 

(ii) (w) Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) shall extend the Offer for any
period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC
or its staff or the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC applicable to the Offer,

 



 

(x) if on any then-scheduled Expiration Date (A) any of the Offer Conditions
set forth in paragraph (b) of _Annex A_ shall not have been satisfied (and, to
the extent permitted, shall not have been waived by Parent) or (B) any of the
Offer Conditions set forth in paragraph (c) or (d) of _Annex A_ shall have
occurred and be continuing (and, to the extent permitted, shall not have been
waived by Parent) then, at the request of the Company, Merger Sub (or Parent
on its behalf) shall extend the Offer for successive extension periods of up
to ten (10) Business Days each, up to and including the Outside Date, the
length of each such period to be determined by Merger Sub (or Parent on its
behalf) in its sole discretion, provided that Merger Sub (or Parent on its
behalf) shall not be required to extend the Offer if Parent determines in good
faith (after consultation with, and giving due consideration to the reasonable
views of, the Company) that any such Offer Condition is not reasonably likely
to be satisfied or no longer to be continuing (as the case may be) on or prior
to the Outside Date,

 



 

(y) if on any then-scheduled Expiration Date, any of the Offer Conditions set
forth in paragraph (e), (f) or (g) of _Annex A_ shall have occurred and be
continuing (and, to the extent permitted, shall not have been waived by
Parent), each breach of or failure to perform a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company that has given rise to the
occurrence and continuance of such Offer Condition is capable of being cured
prior to the Outside Date, and the Company has certified in writing to Merger
Sub and Parent that (A) the Company believes that such breach or failure to
perform is capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date, (B) the Company
has commenced and will diligently undertake to cure such breach or failure to
perform, and (C) the Company believes that such breach or failure to perform
is reasonably likely to be cured prior to the Outside Date (it being
understood that the Companys certification shall not be deemed to be
determinative of whether any breach or failure to perform is capable of being
cured prior to the Outside Date and shall not limit or otherwise prejudice
Parents right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_), then,
at the request of the Company, Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) shall
extend the Offer for successive extension periods of up to ten (10) Business
Days each, up to and including the Outside Date, the length of each such
period to be determined by Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) in its sole
discretion, and

 



 

(z) if on any then-scheduled Expiration Date, the Offer Conditions set forth
in paragraph (b) of _Annex A_ shall have been satisfied (or, to the extent
permitted, waived by Parent) and the other Offer Conditions (other than the
Minimum

 



       
 

 



 

Tender Condition) shall not have occurred and be continuing (or, to the extent
permitted, shall have been waived by Parent), but the Minimum Tender Condition
shall not have been satisfied, then, at the request of the Company, Merger Sub
(or Parent on its behalf) shall extend the Offer for one or more extension
periods of at least five (5) Business Days each (not to exceed twenty (20)
Business Days in the aggregate for all such periods), up to and including the
Outside Date, the length of each such period to be determined by the Company
in its sole discretion.

 



 

(d) Following expiration of the Offer, Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf)
may, in its sole discretion, provide a subsequent offering period or one or
more extensions thereof (a " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") in accordance
with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act if, as of the commencement of such
period, there shall not have been validly tendered (without regard to Shares
tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been
delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee), and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that number of Shares necessary to permit the
Merger to be effected without a meeting of stockholders of the Company in
accordance with Section 302A.621 of the MBCA. The Offer Documents shall
provide for the possibility of a "subsequent offering period".

 



 

(e) Subject to the foregoing, including the requirements of Rule 14d-11 of the
Exchange Act, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer,
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and
pay for (1) all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer promptly after the Expiration Date and (2) each Share validly
tendered in any Subsequent Offering Period promptly after such Share is so
tendered. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence and subject to
the applicable rules of the SEC and the terms and conditions of the Offer,
Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to delay payment for Shares in order
to comply in whole or in part with applicable Laws. Any such delay in payment
shall be effected in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act.

 



 

(f) Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of Shares such amounts
as Merger Sub is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any applicable Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Merger Sub, such amounts shall be (i) paid over to
the appropriate Tax Authority, and (ii) treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Merger Sub.

 



 

(g) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, promptly terminate the Offer without accepting any Shares
previously tendered. If the Offer is terminated by Merger Sub, or this
Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Merger
Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of
Merger Sub to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares
to the registered holders thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto and including any exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_
"), which shall contain an offer to purchase reflecting the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and a form of the letter of transmittal and
summary advertisement and other ancillary documents and instruments, if any,
in respect of the Offer (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein
pursuant to which the Offer shall be made, together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, and including exhibits thereto, the " _Offer Documents_
"); (ii) timely file with the Commissioner of Commerce of the State of
Minnesota any registration statement relating to the Offer required to be
filed pursuant to Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes (the " _Minnesota
Registration Statement_ "); and (iii) cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub in
writing all information concerning the Company that may be required by
applicable Law or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion
in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees
promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Merger Sub agree to take
all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected or supplemented,
to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so corrected or
supplemented, to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as, and to
the extent, required by applicable Law. The Company and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO before it is filed
with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the Company or its
counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly provide the Company and its
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral
comments, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive after the date
hereof from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly
after receipt of those comments. The Company and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review any written responses to such SEC comments,
and Parent shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel.

 _Recommendation_ "; and such actions by the Company Board (and the Committee
of Disinterested Directors) described in clauses (i) through (iii),
collectively, the " _Board Actions_ "). The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of the Board Recommendation
and the other Board Actions.

 



 

(b) The Company shall promptly after the date hereof and from time to time
thereafter as requested by Parent or its agents, furnish Parent with an
updated list (and, if available, computer files) of its shareholders, non-
objecting beneficial owners, mailing labels, the names and addresses of all
record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in
stock depositories, in each case as of the most recent practicable date, and
shall provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists
(and, if available, computer files) of shareholders, non-objecting beneficial
holders, mailing labels and securities positions) and such assistance as

addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company shall, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause any third parties to, cooperate with Parent
and its agents to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in

such holders of Shares to tender Shares in the Offer.

 



 

(c) Concurrently with the filing of the Schedule TO with the SEC on the day
that the Offer is commenced, the Company shall file with the SEC and
disseminate to holders of Shares with the Offer Documents a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto and including any
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall reflect the terms and

any material respect. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as, and to the extent,
required by applicable Law. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed

Section 1.3 _Company Board and Company Board Committees_.

 



 

(a) _Composition of the Company Board and Board Committees_. Effective upon
the initial acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ ", the use of which term
herein shall not, unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether
Parent shall exercise its rights under this _Section 1.3(a)_), and from time
to time thereafter up to the Effective Time, subject to payment for such
shares of Company Common Stock and subject to _Section 1.3(b)_, Parent shall
be entitled to designate up to such number of directors on the Company Board
equal to the product (rounded up to the next whole number) obtained by
multiplying (i) the number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to
any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this _Section 1.3(a)_)
and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Company
Common Stock held by Parent and Merger Sub (giving effect to the shares of
Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to the Offer), and the denominator of
which is the total number of then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.
Promptly following a request by Parent, the Company shall cause the
individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the Company
Board, including either by increasing the size of the Company Board or by
seeking and accepting or otherwise securing the resignations of such number of
then incumbent directors as is necessary to enable the individuals so
designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the Company Board (the date
on which the majority of the Companys directors are designees of Parent that
have been effectively elected or appointed to the Company Board in accordance
herewith, the " _Director Appointment Date_ "). From time to time after the
Acceptance Time, subject to payment for such shares of Company Common Stock
and subject to _Section 1.3(b)_, the Company shall take all action necessary
to cause the individuals so designated by Parent to constitute substantially
the same percentage (rounding up where appropriate) as is on the Company Board
on each committee of the Company Board to the fullest extent permitted by all
applicable Laws, including the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. Solely
for the purposes of this _Section 1.3_, any and all members of the Company
Board immediately prior to such appointments by Parent who remain on the
Company Board after such appointment by Parent shall be referred to as "
_Continuing Directors_ ". Except with respect to two (2) Continuing Directors,
the Company has obtained irrevocable resignations of each director on the
Company Board, which resignations are each contingent solely upon the
occurrence of the Acceptance Time, payment (which, for purposes of this
Agreement, shall be satisfied by receipt by the depositary for the Offer of
funds from Parent or Merger Sub) for all of the shares of Company Common Stock
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and the Companys acceptance
of such resignation. The Company has made available to Parent complete and
correct copies of such resignations on or prior to the date hereof. Upon the
consummation of the Offer, the Company shall accept such number of
resignations as will be necessary to effectuate the exercise of Parents
rights under this _Section 1.3(a)_, subject to _Section 1.3(b)_. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company Board shall have two (2) Continuing Directors.
If the number of directors who are Continuing Directors is reduced below two
(2) prior to the Effective Time, the remaining Continuing Director shall be
entitled to designate an individual to fill such vacancy who is not a current
or former officer, director, employee or consultant of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (a " _Parent Insider_ ") and who shall be deemed a Continuing
Director for all purposes of this Agreement, and the Company shall cause such
designee to be appointed to the Company Board. If, notwithstanding compliance
with the foregoing provisions, the number of Continuing Directors is reduced
to zero (0), then the other directors on the Company Board shall designate

 



      
 

 



 

and appoint to the Company Board two (2) directors who are not Parent Insiders
who shall be deemed Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Continued Listing_. In the event that Parents designees are elected or
appointed to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_, and without
limiting _Section 1.3(a)_, until the Effective Time, the Company Board shall
have at least such number of directors as may be required by the rules of the
NASDAQ Stock Market LLC or the federal securities Laws who are considered
independent directors within the meaning of such Laws (" _Independent
Directors_ "); provided, however, that after the Acceptance Time, subject to
payment by Merger Sub for shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to
the Offer, the Company shall, upon Parents request, take all action necessary
to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" for purposes of Listing Rule
5615(c) of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (or any successor provision) and make
all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status; provided,
further, that in the event the number of Independent Directors shall be
reduced below the number of directors as may be required by such Laws for any
reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to
designate persons to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be Independent
Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no other Independent Director
then remains, the other directors shall designate such number of directors as
may be required by the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC or the federal
securities Laws to fill such vacancies who shall not be shareholders or
Affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub, and such Persons shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligation to appoint
Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_ hereof
shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all action required
pursuant to this _Section 1.3_ and Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this
_Section 1.3_, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with
respect to the Company and its directors and officers as is required under
such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under
this _Section 1.3_. Parent shall, reasonably promptly after the date hereof,
provide to the Company in writing, and be responsible for any information with
respect to itself and its nominees, directors, officers and Affiliates,
required by such Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder. The provisions of this _Section 1.3_ are in addition to, and
shall not limit, any right that Merger Sub, Parent or any Affiliate of Merger
Sub or Parent may have (with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise) under applicable Laws as a holder or beneficial owner of shares of
Company Common Stock.

 



 

(d) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that Parents designees
are elected or appointed to the Company Board prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_ hereof, the prior approval of the Continuing
Directors (or the approval of the sole Continuing Director if there shall only
be one (1) Continuing Director then in office) shall be required in order to,
prior to the Effective Time, (i) amend, modify or terminate this Agreement, or
agree or consent to any amendment, modification or termination of this
Agreement, in any case on behalf of the Company, (ii) extend the time for
performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or
Merger Sub under this Agreement, (iii) exercise or waive any of the Companys
rights under this Agreement, or (iv) amend or otherwise modify in any material
respect the

 



      
 

 



 

articles of incorporation of the Company or the bylaws of the Company, in each
case if such action would adversely affect, or reasonably would be expected to
adversely affect, the holders of Shares (other than Parent or Merger Sub), and
such approval by a majority of the Continuing Directors (or the sole
Continuing Director if there shall only be one (1) Continuing Director then in
office) constitute the authorization of the full Company Board with respect to
the action so approved, and no other action on the part of the Company,
including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required
to authorize, or for the Company to take, such action.

 



 

Section 1.4 _Top-Up Option_.

 



 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an option that is irrevocable
during the term of this Agreement (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this _Section 1.4_, to
purchase the number of Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub and any wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up
Option, shall constitute up to one (1) share more than 90% of the Fully
Diluted Shares but not less than one (1) share more than 90% of the number of
Shares then outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares) for a purchase price per Top-Up Option Share equal to the Offer
Price. The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub in whole or in part;
provided that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable to the extent
the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed
the Companys then authorized and unissued Shares (giving effect to Shares
reserved for issuance under the Stock Plans, as if such Shares were
outstanding).

 



 

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub at any time at or after
the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that
the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the
exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions, unless waived by
the Company, that (i) no provision of any applicable Law, and no temporary
restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or
order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction, shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such
exercise, and (ii) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option and delivery of the Top-
Up Option Shares, the aggregate number of Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub
and any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall constitute at least one (1)
share more than 90% of the number of Shares then outstanding immediately after
the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, provided, further, that the Top-Up
Option shall terminate concurrently with any termination of this Agreement.
Upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, Parent, Merger Sub and Company covenant to
cause the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable following the issuance
of the Top-Up Option Shares.

 



 

(c) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares is accomplished in a manner consistent with all applicable Law,
including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the
Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act. If Merger Sub wishes to so
exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall give the Company written notice
thereof specifying a place and time for the closing of such purchase. At such
closing, (i) the purchase price in respect of the Top-Up Option Shares
purchased upon such

 



      
 

 



 

exercise of the Top-Up Option (which shall equal the product of (A) the number
of Top-Up Option Shares being purchased pursuant to the Top-Up Option and (B)
the Offer Price) shall be paid to the Company, at Merger Subs election,
either (x) entirely in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by the Company, or (y) by paying in cash, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Company, an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of such Top-
Up Option Shares and by delivering to the Company Merger Subs unsecured, non-
negotiable, non-transferable promissory note in the principal amount of the
balance of such purchase price, which promissory note shall bear interest at
the applicable short term federal rate per annum for U.S. income tax purposes
(as periodically set by the IRS), shall mature on the first anniversary of the
date thereof, and may be prepaid in whole or in part without premium or
penalty, and (ii) the Company shall deliver to Merger Sub a certificate or
certificates representing the number of Top-Up Option Shares so purchased. The
parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the
purchase of the Top-Up Shares to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice
is deemed received by the Company and, in any event, as promptly thereafter as
possible. The parties further agree to use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Merger to be consummated in accordance with Section 302A.621 of the
MBCA as contemplated by _Section 6.1(c)_ as close in time as possible to
(including, to the extent possible, on the same day as) the issuance of the
Top-Up Shares.

 



 

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Merger
Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger
Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act.
Any certificates evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares shall include any legends
required by applicable securities Laws.

 



 

(e) In the event of any change in the number of shares of outstanding Company
Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization,
combination, exchange of shares, merger, consolidation, reorganization or the
like or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the Company
that would have the effect of diluting Merger Subs rights under this _Section
1.4_, the number of and the purchase price for Top-Up Option Shares will be
adjusted appropriately so as to restore to Merger Sub its rights hereunder
with respect to the Top-Up Option as the same exists as of the date of this
Agreement.

shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate representing any such Shares
or of any Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender
of such Certificate or such Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section
2.7_, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law.

 



 

(ii) Each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares are changed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Dissenters  Rights_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held of record or
beneficially by a Person who has not voted in favor of approval of the Merger
and adoption of the Plan of Merger and who is entitled to demand and properly
demands dissenters rights with respect to such Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_
") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Sections 302A.471 and
302A.473 of the MBCA (the " _Dissenters  Rights_"), shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such
Dissenting Shares but instead shall be entitled to payment of the fair value
(including interest determined in accordance with Section 302A.473 of the
MBCA) of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Dissenters Rights;
provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise
shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under the Dissenters
Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely

 



      
 

 



 

for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon.
If any demand for fair value is made of Dissenting Shares and the Top-Up
Option was exercised prior to the Effective Time, then for purposes of
determining the fair value of any Dissenting Shares, the cash received and/or
value of the promissory note received by the Company in payment of the
exercise price of the Top-Up Option shall be treated as if it had not been
paid to or received by the Company and the Shares issued upon exercise of the
Top-Up Option shall be treated as if they were not issued or outstanding.

 



 

(b) The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent and its counsel of any
demands, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company for
Dissenters Rights with respect to any Shares, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in, and direct (provided, that such direction may not result in
a binding obligation on the part of the Company that is effective prior to the
Effective Time), all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do
any of the foregoing.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate and
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.7_. Parent
shall, or shall take all steps necessary to enable and cause Merger Sub to,
deposit with the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Effective Time, the cash
necessary to pay for the Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.5_ (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund
shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Exchange
Agent as directed by Parent; provided that no gain or loss thereon shall
affect the amounts payable hereunder and Parent shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Exchange Fund includes at all times cash
sufficient to satisfy Parents obligation under this Agreement. Any net profit
resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on deposit
with the Exchange Agent will be payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise
directs, and no part of such net profits shall accrue to the benefit of
holders of the Shares.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person who was a holder of record of
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose Shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.5_,
(i) the form of letter of transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of
stock certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or uncertificated Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (which transmittal letter shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent); and
(ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate or a Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for
each Share previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, net
of applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to _Section 2.7(f)_, and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall then be canceled. In the
event payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate(s) formerly representing
Shares are registered in the transfer records of the Company, it shall be a
condition of payment that such Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares shall be made only to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered in accordance with this
_Section 2.7_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at all
times from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the Merger Consideration that the holder thereof has the
right to receive in respect of the Shares previously represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant to this _Article 2_. No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 2_.

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. The Merger Consideration paid
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this _Article 2_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously
represented by such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
the Surviving Corporation shall not permit any further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Article 2_,
except as otherwise provided by Law.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article 2_ shall thereafter only be entitled to receive from Parent (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, as general creditors thereof)
payment of their claim for Merger Consideration. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares
immediately prior to the time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or

 



       
 

 



 

destroyed and, if requested by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by
such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange
Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Exchange Agent and the
Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, whether pursuant to _Section
1.1(e)_ , _Section 2.5(a)(i)_ or _Section 2.8_ , such amounts as Parent,
Merger Sub, the Exchange Agent or the Company is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the applicable Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Exchange
Agent or the Company, such amount shall be (i) paid over to the appropriate
Tax Authority; and (ii) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the former holder of the Shares, Options or Shares of Restricted
Stock, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Exchange Agent or the Company.

 



 

Section 2.8 _Equity-Based Compensation Plans and Awards_.

the Effective Time shall be treated in the same manner as Shares that are

of the aggregate Option Consideration with respect to such 1997 Option.
Following the Acceptance Time, no 1997 Option that was outstanding immediately
prior to the Acceptance Time shall remain outstanding and each former holder
of any such 1997 Option shall only be entitled to receive the consideration
(if any) set forth in this _Section 2.8(b)_ in exchange for such 1997 Option
in accordance with this _Section 2.8(b)_. The consideration (if any) payable
under this _Section 2.8(b)_ to each former holder of a 1997 Option that was
outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall be paid by the
Company to such former holder as soon as practicable following the Acceptance
Time (but in any event not later than three (3) Business Days thereafter), net
of any Taxes withheld pursuant to _Section 2.7(f)_.

with respect to each Option (a " _2006 Option_ ") issued under the 2006 Long
Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the " _2006 Plan_ "), that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, such 2006

 



      
 

 



 

Option, if unvested, shall become vested as of immediately after the
Acceptance Time. Following the Acceptance Time or, if Merger Sub (or Parent on
its behalf) provides a Subsequent Offering Period pursuant to _Section 1.1(d)_
, following the expiration of such Subsequent Offering Period, if Merger Sub
exercises the Top-Up Option pursuant to _Section 1.4_ , Merger Sub (or Parent
on its behalf) may request in writing, contemporaneously with such exercise of
the Top-Up Option, that the Company cause each 2006 Option that is then
outstanding to be cancelled promptly, and upon receipt of such written request
the Company shall take all action necessary to cause all such 2006 Options to
be cancelled promptly (such time of cancellation, the " _2006 Option
Cancellation Time_ ")). If the exercise price of any such 2006 Option is equal
to or greater than the Offer Price, such 2006 Option shall be cancelled as of
the 2006 Option Cancellation Time, without any consideration being payable in
respect thereof, and have no further force or effect. If the exercise price of
any such 2006 Option is less than the Offer Price, such 2006 Option shall be
cancelled as of the 2006 Option Cancellation Time in exchange for the right to
receive for each such 2006 Option, in accordance with this _Section 2.8(c)_ ,
a lump sum cash payment in the amount of the aggregate Option Consideration
with respect to such 2006 Option. Following the 2006 Option Cancellation Time,
no such 2006 Option that was outstanding immediately prior to the 2006 Option
Cancellation Time shall remain outstanding and each former holder of any such
2006 Option shall only be entitled to receive the consideration (if any) set

immediately prior to the 2006 Option Cancellation Time shall be paid by the
Company to such former holder as soon as practicable following the 2006 Option
Cancellation Time (but in any event not later than three (3) Business Days
thereafter), net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to _Section 2.7(f)_.

 



 

(d) With respect to each Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, such Option, if unvested, shall become vested as of

the Company to such former holder as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time (but in any event not later than three (3) Business Days
thereafter), net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to _Section 2.7(f)_.

Plan effective as of immediately after the Acceptance Time and (ii) shall

any foreign jurisdiction; or (B) under which neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has any actual or contingent legal obligations.

 



 

(b) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, the Company has made to Parent

event has occurred and no condition exists that would subject the Company or

(d) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section

letter from the IRS to the effect that such Employee Benefit Plan is qualified
and the plan and trust related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes
under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and nothing has
occurred, whether by action or failure to act, that could reasonably be
expected to cause the loss of such qualification.

Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries; (ii) any cancellation of
indebtedness owed to the Company by any shareholder, director or employee of
the Company; (iii) the acceleration of the vesting, funding or time of any
payment or benefit to any shareholder, director or employee of the Company;
(iv) any limitation or restriction on the right of the Company to merge, amend

correct and complete list identifying each International Plan. Copies of each
International Plan and any amendments thereto have been made available to
Parent, and copies of, to the extent applicable, any related trust or funding
agreements or insurance policies, amendments thereto, actuarial reports
relating thereto and prospectuses or summary plan descriptions relating
thereto have been made available to Parent. Each International Plan has been
established and maintained in compliance with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by applicable Law (including any special provisions
relating to qualified plans where such International Plan was intended to so
qualify) and has been maintained in good standing with the applicable
regulatory authorities. All International Plans that are required to be funded
are fully funded, and with respect to all other International Plans, adequate
reserves therefore have been established on the accounting statements of the
applicable Company or Subsidiary entity. No material liability or obligation
of the Company or its Subsidiaries exists with respect to such International
Plans that has not been disclosed on _Section 3.10(i)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(j) No transaction prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the

compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act (including amendments to
existing employment agreements, amendments to existing change in control
agreements and/or new retention bonus agreements being entered into by the
Company and certain of the Companys executive officers and other employees,
in each case in connection with the Transactions); and (ii) taken all other
actions necessary or advisable to satisfy the requirements of the non-
exclusive safe harbor with respect to such agreement, arrangement or
understanding in accordance with Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act. The
Company Board has determined that the Companys Compensation Committee is
composed solely of "independent directors" in accordance with the requirements
of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto.

 



 

Section 3.11 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company Board has received
from the Company Financial Advisor an opinion to the effect that, as of the
date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and
assumptions set forth therein, the consideration to be

 



      
 

 



 

received by the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the
Merger, taken together, is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates).

cash, cash equivalents and Marketable Securities of the Company and the

institution in which the Company or the Company Subsidiaries maintain any

provisions of _Section 1.4_ (including, if the Top-Up Option has been
exercised, the last sentence of _Section 1.4(d)_ ), in the event that Parent,
Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent collectively shall
acquire ownership of at least 90% of the Fully Diluted Shares pursuant to the

Section 6.2 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor all Employee Benefit Plans of the Company
(excluding the Stock Plans to be terminated at or prior to the Effective Time
in accordance herewith) and all employment, severance and termination plans
and agreements, in each case in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time. Until the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
(" _Company Employees_ "): annual base salaries, incentive compensation and
other employee benefits (other than equity-based compensation) that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the annual base salaries,
incentive compensation and other employee benefits provided to such employees
immediately before the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits
(but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any plan) under the employee
benefit plans of Parent and the Company Subsidiaries providing benefits to any
Company Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company
Employee shall, subject to applicable Law, be credited with his or her years
of service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Employee Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in

 



      
 

 



 

any and all New Plans except to the extent any waiting time in effect under
the comparable Employee Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time would not have been
satisfied; and (ii) (A) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent
shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived
under the Employee Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (B) Parent shall cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Employee Benefit Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

(c) If any Company Employee (who is not otherwise a party to an agreement
providing for severance benefits) is terminated prior to the first anniversary
of the Closing Date under circumstances under which such Company Employee
would have received severance benefits under the Companys severance practices
as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Severance Practices_ "),
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide such
Company Employee with severance benefits that are no less than the severance
benefits that would have been paid to such Company Employee under the Company
Severance Practices as in existence on the date of this Agreement; provided
that Parent may condition such Company Employees entitlement to such
severance benefits on such Company Employees execution of a release of claims
in favor of Parent, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates. _Section 6.2(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
description of the Company Severance Practices.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall modify or amend any Employee Benefit Plan
of the Company or other agreement, plan, program, or document unless this
Agreement explicitly states that the provision "amends" such Employee Benefit
Plan of the Company or other agreement, plan, program, or document. Nothing in
this _Section 6.2_ shall obligate Parent to employ any person for any period
of time after the Effective Time, and this _Section 6.2_ shall not be
construed to limit the ability of Parent to alter the terms and conditions of,
or terminate, the employment of any person (other than with respect to
compensation and benefits as provided expressly in this _Section 6.2_ ).
Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.6(b)_ , nothing in this _Section
6.2_ shall be construed as giving any Person (including any Company Employee
or dependent or beneficiary thereof) any right, remedy or claim under or in
respect of this _Section 6.2_.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement, the Company shall cause to be amended the employee benefit plans
and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to provide
that no employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries shall commence participation
therein following the Effective Time unless the Surviving Corporation or such
Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such participation.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.3 _Antitrust Filings_.

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement and in
no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
each of the Company and Parent shall file all notices, reports, documents and
other filings that Parent determines are reasonably required to be filed by
such party with any Governmental Authority with respect to the Offer, the
Merger, the Top-Up Option and the other Transactions (the " _Government
Filings_ ") and submit promptly any additional information requested by any
such Governmental Authority. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain any government clearance, approval or
authorization required under the HSR Act and other applicable foreign merger
notification or antitrust Laws (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ ") in respect
of any Government Filings under Antitrust Laws (the " _Antitrust Filings_ ").
Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly (1) supply the other party with
any information that may be required in order to effectuate the Antitrust
Filings, (2) supply any additional information which reasonably may be
required by any Governmental Authority in connection with the Antitrust
Filings or which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate, (3) notify the
other party upon receipt of (x) any comments from any Governmental Authority
in connection with any Antitrust Filings made pursuant hereto, and (y) any
request by any Governmental Authority for amendments or supplements to any
Antitrust Filings made pursuant to, or information provided to comply in all
material respects with, any Action, (4) give the other party notice of the
commencement or overt threat of commencement of any Action by or before any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions, (5) keep the other
party reasonably informed as to the status of any such Action or overt threat
and (6) inform the other party of any communication to or from any
Governmental Authority regarding the Transactions. Except as may be prohibited
by any Governmental Authority or by any Law, (a) the Company and Parent will
consult and cooperate with one another, and will consider in good faith the
views of one another, in connection with any analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in connection with any Law by or before any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Transactions, and (b) in connection with any such Action,
each of the Company and Parent will permit authorized Representatives of the
other party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to any such
Action and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document,
opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Authority in
connection with any such Law. Parent will, after consultation with the Company
and after giving due consideration to the reasonable suggestions of the
Company or its counsel, determine strategy, lead all proceedings and
coordinate activities with respect to seeking any actions, consents, approvals
or waivers of any Governmental Authority as contemplated hereby, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries will take such actions as reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with obtaining such consents, approvals or waivers.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent shall not be obliged to take or accept (or commit to take or accept),
and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall take or accept (or
commit to take or accept), without Parents prior consent, any action
(including those specified in, or required by, the second sentence of _Section
6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.5_ ) or any condition, restriction, obligation or
requirement with respect to Parent, the Company, their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates assets if such action,
condition, restriction, obligation or requirement, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected (i) to prohibit or materially restrict
the ability of Parent or any of

 



      
 

 



 

its Affiliates effectively to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of
ownership (including with respect to voting) of the Shares to be purchased
pursuant to the Offer or otherwise in the Merger or of the assets or business
of the Company, (ii) to deprive Parent and its Affiliates of a material
benefit or material benefits or to materially impair the benefits Parent and
its Affiliates expect to derive from the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions, (iii) to be materially adverse to the assets or businesses, the
operation of the businesses or the financial condition or results of
operations, of the Parent and its Affiliates (including, for these purposes,
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole, assuming
for purposes of this determination that the Parent and its Affiliates (as so
defined) are of equivalent size to the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, or (iv) to be materially adverse to the assets or businesses,
the operation of the businesses, or the financial condition or results of
operations of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(each of the consequences in clauses (i) through (iv), a " _Substantial
Detriment_ "); provided, however, that none of Parent and its Affiliates shall
be required to take or accept (or commit to take or accept) any action,
condition, restriction, obligation or requirement in order to obtain any
government clearance, approval or authorization involving any business or
asset of Parent or its Affiliates that would otherwise be required by this
_Section 6.3(b)_ unless there is no action, condition, restriction, obligation
or requirement that would permit such government clearance, approval or
authorization to be obtained that involves solely businesses or assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and to which Parent is required by this _Section
6.3(b)_ , or is otherwise willing in Parents sole discretion, to agree.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Public Statements_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.8_ , each of Parent and the Company agrees that no
public release or announcement concerning the Transactions shall be issued by
any party without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as
such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law, court process
or any listing rules of the Tokyo Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market
LLC or other national securities exchanges or trading markets; provided,
however, that these restrictions shall not apply to any Company communications
regarding (or any Parent communications in response thereto) either (a) a
Takeover Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with the Companys outside counsel and financial advisor)
constitutes a Superior Proposal and that such action is required for the
Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (b)
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. The parties shall issue a joint press
release, mutually acceptable to the Company and Parent, promptly upon
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Prior to making any material or broadly disseminated written or material
oral communication to the directors, officers or employees of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries (or to a particular class of employees of the
Company) pertaining to compensation or benefits matters that are affected by
the Transactions, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended
communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and
comment on the communication, and Parent and the Company shall reasonably
cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable communication.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Further Actions_. Subject to _Section 6.3(b)_ , Parent and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary to consummate the

 



      
 

 



 

Offer, the Merger and, if exercised, the Top-Up Option and make effective the
other Transactions as promptly as practicable. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, each party to this Agreement (i) shall make all filings (if
any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made with or given to any
Governmental Authority by such party in connection with the Offer, the Merger,
the Top-Up Option and the other Transactions and (ii) shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain each consent (if any) of any third party required,
proper or advisable to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Law or
Contract, or otherwise) by such party in connection with the Offer, the
Merger, the Top-Up Option and each of the other Transactions; provided, that
in no event will the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pay prior to the
Effective Time any material fee, penalty or other material consideration to
any third party to obtain any consent pursuant to _Section 6.5(ii)_ without
Parents consent. The Company shall promptly deliver to Parent a copy of each
such filing made, each such notice given and each such consent obtained by the
Company during the Pre-Closing Period. The Company and Parent will consult and
cooperate with one another, and will consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with any actions described in this _Section 6.5_. The
provisions of this _Section 6.5_ shall not apply to any matters covered under
_Section 6.3(a)_.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent
and Merger Sub shall provide prompt notice to the Company, of (a)(i) any
notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions; (ii)
any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions; (iii) any Actions commenced or, to its
Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
the Company or any Company Subsidiaries or Parent and any Company
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to any
Section of this Agreement or that relate to the consummation of the
Transactions; or (b) any material failure of Parent and Merger Sub or the
Company, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section
6.6_ shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other
provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies available to the party
receiving such notice.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality._

 



 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall afford, and shall cause
the Company Subsidiaries and the officers, directors and employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to afford, the officers, employees and
agents of Parent and Merger Sub reasonable access during normal business
hours, to the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries officers, employees,
properties, facilities, books, records, correspondence (in each case, whether
in physical or electronic form), contracts and other assets as Parent shall
reasonably request as long as such access does not materially interfere with
the conduct of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries business, and shall
promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub (i) a copy of each report, schedule and
other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any communication received by
the Company from the SEC concerning compliance with securities laws with
respect to matters unrelated to the Transactions; and (ii) all other
information concerning its and the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel, in each case (A) as
Parent through its officers, employees or agents may reasonably request; (B)
that are in the possession, custody or control of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary; and (C) the disclosure of which would not violate any Law or
Judgment. Parent, Merger Sub and their respective officers, employees and
agents will hold any such information that is non-public in confidence in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. No additional investigations or
disclosures shall affect the Companys representations and warranties
contained herein, or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to
Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Until the Effective Time, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
dated January 28, 2011 between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms.

 



 

Section 6.8 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
shall not and shall not authorize or permit their respective directors,
officers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants, agents and other representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
explore, induce or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including through the
furnishing of any nonpublic information) the submission or announcement of any
proposal that could lead to any Takeover Proposal (including by convening a
Committee of Disinterested Directors to take action on such proposal under
Section 302A.673 of the MBCA), (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person with respect to any Takeover Proposal or any
inquiry or indication of interest that could reasonably be expected to lead to
a Takeover Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any Takeover
Proposal, (iv) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any
Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any Takeover Proposal or (v)
otherwise cooperate in any way with, assist or participate in, or knowingly
encourage or facilitate (including through the furnishing of any nonpublic
information regarding the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in
connection with or in response to a Takeover Proposal or an inquiry or
indication of interest that could lead to a Takeover Proposal or providing
access to the properties, books, records or management of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries) any effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek
any of the foregoing; provided, however, that prior to the Acceptance Time,
this _Section 6.8_ shall not prohibit the Company or its Representatives from
convening the Committee of Disinterested Directors under Section 302A.673 of
the MBCA or from furnishing nonpublic information regarding the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries to, or entering into discussions with, any Person
in response to a written Takeover Proposal that is submitted to the Company by
such Person (and not withdrawn) if (A) none of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives shall have
breached in any material respect or taken any action inconsistent in any
material respect with any of the provisions set forth in this _Section 6.8_ ,
(B) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor, that such Takeover
Proposal is reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal and that such
action is required for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, (C) at least 24 hours prior to furnishing any such
nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions with, such Person, the
Company gives Parent written notice of the identity of such Person and of the
Companys intention to furnish

 



      
 

 



 

nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions with, such Person, and the
Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement in a
customary form that is no less favorable to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement, and (D) the Company furnishes such nonpublic
information to Parent within 24 hours after such nonpublic information is
furnished to such Person (to the extent such nonpublic information has not
been previously furnished or made available by the Company to Parent). Without
limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence by any Representative of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this _Section
6.8_ by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
_Section 6.8(a)_ shall prohibit the Company or the Companys Board of
Directors from taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position
with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act; provided, however, that in no event shall the foregoing affect
the obligations of the Company specified in _Section 6.8(e)(i)_ (it being
understood that any "stop, look and listen" communication by or on behalf of
the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation).

 



 

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall promptly (and in no event
later than 24 hours after receipt thereof) advise Parent orally and in writing
of any Takeover Proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (including the identity of the Person making or submitting such
Takeover Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request, and the
material terms and conditions thereof) that is made or submitted by any Person
during the Pre-Closing Period. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably
informed with respect to the status and details of any such Takeover Proposal,
inquiry, indication of interest or request (including any material
modification or proposed modification thereto) and any discussions or
negotiations concerning the terms and conditions thereof and (ii) provide to
Parent promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt or delivery
thereof) copies of all correspondence and other written material (including
draft agreements) relating to any such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, indication
of interest or request exchanged between the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (or their Representatives), on the one hand, and the Person
making such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request (or
its Representatives), on the other hand, other than correspondence or other
written material that does not relate to any material term or condition of
such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request.

 



 

(c) As of the date hereof, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall, and
shall cause their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Person that
relate to any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or indication of interest that
could lead to a Takeover Proposal or any request for nonpublic information
relating to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or indication of interest that could lead to
a Takeover Proposal. The Company shall also immediately terminate all physical
and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such Person or its
Representatives.

 



 

(d) The Company agrees, except in the case that the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that such action
is required for the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, to not
release or permit the release during the Pre-Closing Period of any Person
from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries is a party; provided, however, that if the Company
waives any "standstill" or similar provision with respect to any Person, then
the terms of any "standstill" or similar provision in the Confidentiality
Agreement shall be waived.

 



 

(e) (i) During the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (A) (1) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent), the Board Recommendation or (2) approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or publicly propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any
Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (A) being referred to
as an " _Company Adverse Change Recommendation_ ") or (B) approve, recommend
or declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or execute or enter into any Contract constituting or related to,
or that is intended to or would be reasonably likely to lead to, any Takeover
Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the Company to
abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise
materially impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the Transactions
(other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 6.8(a)_ ).

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.8(e)(i)_
, if at any time prior to the Acceptance Time the Company receives a Takeover
Proposal which the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor, is
a Superior Proposal (after giving effect to all of the revisions to the terms
of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent, including pursuant to clause
(B)(2) below), the Company Board prior to the Acceptance Time (x) may make a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation and/or (y) may terminate this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 8.1(d)_ in order to enter into a definitive
agreement providing for the implementation of such Superior Proposal, in each
case if the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that such Company Adverse Change Recommendation
and/or such termination of this Agreement and entry into of such definitive
agreement is required for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company shall not
terminate this agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless concurrently with such termination the Company
pays the Termination Fee and otherwise complies with the provisions of
_Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.3_ ; and provided, further, that the Company
Board may not effect a Company Adverse Change Recommendation pursuant to the
foregoing clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (y) unless (A) the Company shall have complied in all material respects
with the provisions of this _Section 6.8_ , and (B) (1) the Company shall have
provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four (4) Business Days in
advance, of its intention to take such action with respect to such Superior
Proposal, which notice shall include the terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and the identity of the third party making such Superior Proposal and
attaching a copy of the most current draft of any written agreement relating
to such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment
to any material term or condition of such Superior Proposal shall require a
new written notice to Parent and an additional three (3) Business Day notice
period), (2) the Company shall have given Parent four (4) Business Days after
Parents

 



      
 

 



 

receipt of the written notice of such Superior Proposal (or, in the case of an
amendment to any material term or condition of such Superior Proposal, three
(3) Business Days after Parents receipt of the written notice of such
amendment) to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another
proposal and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to
such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering
the results of such negotiations and giving effect to such proposed revisions
or other proposal, if any, the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and the Company Financial
Advisor, that such Superior Proposal continues to meet the definition of
"Superior Proposal" and, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the Company Adverse Change Recommendation and/or termination of this Agreement
is required for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to advancement of expenses,
indemnification and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of each
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement
or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as
provided in the Company Charter Documents or Subsidiary Documents, in each
case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other
indemnification agreements in effect on the date of this Agreement in the
forms made available by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement, shall survive the Merger from the Effective Time through the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs. The articles
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and
Parent shall cause the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of each Indemnified
Party than are set forth in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Parent shall either (i) cause to be maintained in effect, for a period of
six (6) years after the Effective Time, the directors and officers liability
insurance policy that is in effect at the Agreement Date (the " _D andO
Insurance_") covering acts or omissions at or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to those persons who are covered by the DandO Insurance as of the
Effective Time, or (ii) obtain, in consultation with the Company, a prepaid
(or "tail") directors and officers liability insurance policy covering acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for a period of six
(6) years after the Effective Time, with respect to those persons who are
covered by the DandO Insurance as of the Effective Time on terms with respect to
such coverage and amounts no less favorable to such indemnified persons than
those of the DandO Insurance; provided, that (A) this _Section 6.9(b)_ shall not
extend or otherwise increase obligations of the Company to provide coverage
for acts or omissions of directors or officers of any Person acquired by the
Company prior to the date of this Agreement beyond the terms provided for in
the agreements with respect to such transactions; (B) Parent may substitute
one or more policies of a reputable and financially sound insurance company
for the DandO Insurance, so long as such substitute policies have at least the
same coverage and amounts and contain terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the persons currently covered by the DandO Insurance; (C) Parent
shall not be required to pay any annual premium for the DandO Insurance or any
substitutes with respect thereto in excess of 250% of the amount (the

 



      
 

 



 

" _Maximum Amount_ ") paid by the Company for coverage for the period of
twelve (12) months most recently commenced prior to the date of this
Agreement; and (D) if the premium for the DandO Insurance or any substitutes
therefor exceeds such amount, Parent shall purchase a substitute policy with
the greatest coverage available for 250% of the Maximum Amount.

 



 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.9_.

 



 

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 6.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party to whom this _Section 6.9_ applies without the written consent of such
affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties to whom this _Section 6.9_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries
of this _Section 6.9_ , each of whom may enforce the provisions of this
_Section 6.9_ ).

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current and former officers and directors of
the Company by Law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Transactions (including
derivative securities of such shares) by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 6.11 _State Takeover Laws_. The Company shall, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, use its reasonable best efforts (a) to take all actions
necessary so that no "control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium"
or other antitakeover or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to
the Transactions and (b) if any such antitakeover or similar statute or
regulation becomes applicable to the Transactions, to take all actions
necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise to take all such
other actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects
of any such statute or regulation on the Transactions.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. After the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and the rules and
policies of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC to enable the de-listing by the
Surviving Corporation of the Company Stock from the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC
and the deregistration of the Company Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly
as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than ten
(10) days thereafter.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.13 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(c) _Completion of the Offer_. Parent or Merger Sub shall have accepted for
payment all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Failure of Conditions_. None of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.1_ to be
satisfied to excuse performance by such party of its obligations hereunder, if
such failure was caused by such partys failure to act in good faith and in
compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the Offer.

 



 

ARTICLE 8

 

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 



 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time prior to
the Effective Time; or

 



 

(b) by either the Company or Parent as follows:

 



 

(i) if the Acceptance Time shall not have occurred on or before September 24,
2011 (the " _Outside Date_ "); provided, however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any
party if the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur on or before the Outside
Date was primarily caused by or resulted primarily from the failure of such
party (or in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) to fulfill any of its obligations
under this Agreement in any material respect; or

 



   

     
 

 



 

(ii) if any Judgment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a
Governmental Authority, or Law or other legal restraint or prohibition, in
each case making the consummation of the Offer or Merger illegal or
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise preventing the consummation
thereof shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable;
provided that the right to terminate pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_
shall not be available if the issuance of such Judgment, legal restraint or
prohibition was primarily caused by or resulted primarily from the failure of
such party (or in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) to fulfill any of its
obligations under this Agreement in any material respect; or

 



 

(iii) if the Offer (as it may have been extended pursuant to _Section 1.1_ )
expires as a result of the non-satisfaction of any Offer Conditions or is
terminated or withdrawn pursuant to its terms without any Shares being
purchased thereunder (for avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (iii) unless and
until Parents and Merger Subs right to extend the Offer pursuant to _Section
1.1_ has expired and Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this clause (iii) unless and until the Companys right to request
extension of the Offer pursuant to _Section 1.1(b)(ii)(y)_ and _(z)_ has
expired); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ shall not be available to any party if the non-
satisfaction of any Offer Conditions or the termination or withdrawal of the
Offer pursuant to its terms without any Shares being purchased thereunder was
primarily caused by or resulted primarily from the failure of such party (or
in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) to fulfill any of its obligations under
this Agreement in any material respect; or

 



 

(c) by Parent, prior to the Acceptance Time, if (i) a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (or any action by any committee of the Company Board
which, if taken by the full Company Board, would be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change) shall have occurred (whether or not in compliance with
_Section 6.8_ ); (ii) the Company or the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) shall (A) approve, adopt or recommend any Takeover Proposal; or (B)
approve or recommend, or enter into or allow the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into, a letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange
agreement, option agreement or other similar Contract relating to a Takeover
Proposal; (iii) the Company Board fails to publicly reaffirm the Board
Recommendation within seven (7) Business Days after the Companys receipt of a
written request by Parent to provide such reaffirmation following the date of
any Takeover Proposal or any modification; provided that Parent shall be
permitted to request only one such reaffirmation request per Takeover Proposal
and one additional reaffirmation request per each amendment thereof and
supplement thereto; (iv) if any tender offer or exchange offer is commenced by
any Person other than Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent with
respect to the outstanding Shares, and the Company Board shall not have
recommended that the Companys shareholders reject such tender offer or
exchange offer and not tender their Shares into such tender offer or exchange
offer within seven (7) Business Days after commencement of such tender offer
or exchange offer; (v) the Company shall have breached in any material respect
any of its obligations under _Section 6.8_ ; (vi) the Company shall have
failed to include the Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or to permit
Parent to include the Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents; or (vii)
the Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall authorize or
publicly propose to do any of the actions specified in clause (i), (ii),
(iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) of this _Section 8.1(c)_ ; or

 



      
 

 



 

(d) by the Company, in accordance with _Section 6.8(e)(ii)_ , but only if the
Company shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations
under _Section 6.8_ and is otherwise permitted to accept the applicable
Superior Proposal pursuant to _Section 6.8(e)(ii)_ , provided that the
Company, concurrently with such termination, (x) enters into the definitive
agreement providing for the implementation of such Superior Proposal and (y)
pays the Termination Fee to Parent in accordance with the applicable
provisions of _Section 8.3_ ; or

 



 

(e) by Parent, prior to the purchase of any Shares pursuant to the Offer, if
there has been a breach of or failure to perform any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement,
which breach or failure to perform (i) would cause any of the conditions set
forth in _Annex A_ not to be satisfied; and (ii) is incapable of being cured
prior to the Outside Date; provided that neither Parent nor Merger Sub is then
in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this
Agreement which, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted in a Parent
Material Adverse Effect; or

 



 

(f) by the Company, prior to the purchase of any Shares pursuant to the Offer,
if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth
in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) shall have had or is
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect and (ii) is incapable of being cured prior to the Outside Date;
provided that the Company is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement; or

 



 

(g) by the Company, if Merger Sub shall not have commenced (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer on or prior to the tenth
Business Day after the public announcement of the execution of this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_ , if such failure (A) is curable
by Merger Sub and Merger Sub is continuing to exercise its reasonable best
efforts to cure such failure, unless such failure shall remain uncured for a
period of five (5) days commencing on the date that the Company gives Merger
Sub notice of such failure, or (B) is attributable to a failure on the part of
the Company to perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement required
to be performed by the Company at or prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day
after the public announcement of the execution of this Agreement.

 



 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement shall deliver written notice of
such termination to the other party, setting forth in such notice the
provision of this _Section 8.1_ pursuant to which such party is terminating
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. Upon the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of
no effect without any liability of any party to another party except for the
provisions of (a) _Sections 3.9_ and _4.6_ , (b) this _Section 8.2_ ; (c)
_Section 8.3_ (Fees and Expenses); and (d) _Article 9_ (General Provisions),
which shall survive such termination; provided that nothing herein shall
relieve any party from liability for any fraud or willful breach of this
Agreement. For the purpose hereof, the term "willful breach" shall mean a
breach that is a consequence of an act undertaken by the breaching party with
the knowledge (actual or constructive) that the taking of such act would, or
would be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be

 



      
 

 



 

affected by the termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_ , all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the
party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger
is consummated.

 



 

(b) The Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of $8,200,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ "), in the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ ;

 



 

(ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ ;

 



 

(iii) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ if the
Minimum Tender Condition has not been satisfied or _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ if
the Minimum Tender Condition has not been satisfied, so long as, in any such
case, before the date of such termination, a Takeover Proposal at a higher
price than the Offer Price shall have been communicated to the holders of
Company Common Stock or shall have been publicly announced or otherwise become
publicly known, provided, however, that, for purposes of this _Section
8.3(b)(iii)_ , all references to "20%" in the definition of "Takeover
Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%";

 



 

(iv) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ if the
Minimum Tender Condition has not been satisfied, or _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ if
the Minimum Tender Condition has not been satisfied, so long as, in any such
case, (A) before the date of such termination, a Takeover Proposal shall have
been communicated to the Company Board or the holders of Company Common Stock
or shall have been publicly announced or otherwise become publicly known; and
(B) within twelve (12) months after the date of termination, (x) the Company
shall have entered into a definitive agreement for any Takeover Proposal
(regardless of whether made before or after the termination of this Agreement)
or any such Takeover Proposal is consummated or (y) a tender or exchange offer
or other Takeover Proposal is first publicly announced within twelve (12)
months after such termination and is subsequently consummated; provided,
however, that, for purposes of this _Section 8.3(b)(iv)_ , all references to
"20%" in the definition of "Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be
references to "50%"; or

 



 

(v) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ , in each case
if the Company is then in material breach of its covenants or agreements, so
long as, in any such case, before the date of such breach, a Takeover Proposal
shall have been communicated to the Company Board or the holders of Company
Common Stock or shall have been publicly announced or otherwise become
publicly known; provided, however, that, for purposes of this _Section
8.3(b)(v)_ , all references to "20%" in the definition of "Takeover Proposal"
shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

 



 

(c) The Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to half of the Termination Fee,
in the event that this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _8.1(b)(i)_ if the Minimum Tender Condition has not been satisfied or
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ if the Minimum Tender Condition has not been satisfied,
so long as, in any such case, within twelve (12) months after the date of
termination, (x) the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement
for any Takeover Proposal (regardless of whether made before or after the
termination of this Agreement) at a higher price than the Offer Price or any
such Takeover Proposal is consummated or (y) a tender or exchange offer or
other Takeover Proposal at a higher price than the Offer Price is first
publicly announced within twelve (12) months after such termination and is
subsequently consummated; provided, however, that, for purposes of this
_Section 8.3(c)_ , all references to "20%" in the definition of "Takeover
Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

 



 

(d) Any fee due under _Section 8.3(b)(i)_ , _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_ or _Section
8.3(b)(v)_ shall be paid to Parent by wire transfer of same-day funds within
two (2) Business Days after the date of termination of this Agreement. Any fee
under _Section 8.3(b)(ii)_ shall be paid to Parent by wire transfer of same-
day funds concurrently with the termination. Any fee due under _Section
8.3(b)(iv)_ or _Section 8.3(c)_ shall be paid to Parent by wire transfer of
same-day funds within two (2) Business Days after the date on which the last
applicable event referenced therein occurs.

 



 

(e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. The parties
acknowledge and agree that neither the Termination Fee nor the fee due under
_Section 8.3(c)_ is a penalty, but rather constitutes damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the circumstances in
which such fee is payable.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to _Section 1.3(d)_ , this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after adoption of this
Agreement and the Transactions by the respective Boards of Directors or
shareholders of the parties hereto; provided, however, that after any adoption
of the Plan of Merger by the holders of Shares, no amendment of the Plan of
Merger shall be made without the further approval of such shareholders. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. Subject to _Section 1.3(d)_ , at any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other parties hereto; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and
(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall not apply to any time for
performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance
with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is
specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Section 9.3 _Interpretations_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section or Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words "include," "includes" and

(a) This Agreement, and any dispute arising out of, relating to, or in

of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 



 

(b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent

are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (i)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any such court with
respect to any dispute arising out of, relating to or in connection with this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (ii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (iii) agrees
that it will not bring any action arising out of, relating to or in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this

the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective

PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR LIABILITY, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER; AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS

MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.4(C)_.

Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, and delivered by means of facsimile
transmission or other electronic transmission, each of which when so executed

together shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement may be
executed and delivered by facsimile or .pdf transmission.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and all of the provisions hereto shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations set forth herein shall be assigned
by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto and any purported assignment without such consent shall be void, except
that Parent may assign all or any of its rights and obligations hereunder to
any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent without the Companys
prior consent; provided, however, that no assignment shall release Parent of
its obligations hereunder.

 



 

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as giving any Person, other
than the parties hereto and their heirs, successors, legal representatives and
permitted assigns, any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
Agreement or any provision hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and
after the Acceptance Time, _Section 6.9_ (with respect to which the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries) is for the benefit of
the Persons named therein and such Persons may specifically enforce such
provisions.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable Law, then such
contravention or invalidity shall not invalidate the entire Agreement. Such
provision shall be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it
legal, valid and enforceable, and if no such modification shall render it
legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement shall be construed as if not
containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations of
the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments
referred to herein that are to be delivered at Closing) and the
Confidentiality Agreement contain all of the terms of the understandings of
the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the
parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject
matter hereof, and the parties hereto specifically disclaim reliance on any
such prior understandings, agreements or representations to the extent not
embodied in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Enforcement_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement without posting a bond
or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Disclosure Letter_. The inclusion of any information in the
Company Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is required by the
terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in or is reasonably
likely to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect or is outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

 _Annex A_

 



 

 _Conditions of the Offer_

 



 

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ but not defined herein have the

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or the Agreement, Merger Sub shall
not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act
(relating to Merger Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares
promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, and may, subject to the provisions of
the Agreement, delay the acceptance for payment of or the payment for, any
tendered Shares, and (subject to the provisions of the Agreement) may
terminate the Offer and not accept for payment any tendered Shares, (i) unless
each of the following conditions in clauses (a) and (b) are satisfied or (ii)
if at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and before the
expiration of the Offer, any of the following events or circumstances in
clauses (c) through (i) shall have occurred and be continuing:

 



 

(a) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (as extended in
accordance with the Agreement), the number of Shares validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn, together with any Shares owned by Parent or any wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent, equals at least a majority of the Fully Diluted
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (the " _Minimum
Tender Condition_ ");

 



 

(b) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (as extended in
accordance with the Agreement), (x) any waiting period (and any extensions
thereof) under the HSR Act and any approvals or clearances applicable to the
Offer or the consummation of the Merger under other Antitrust Laws shall have
expired, or been terminated or obtained, as applicable and (y) if, following
any discussions between Parent and CFIUS staff regarding the Transactions,
Parent determines that it is desirable for the parties to file a notice
pursuant to the Exon-Florio Amendment, any review by CFIUS shall have
concluded, the President of the United States of America shall not have taken
action to block or prevent the consummation of the Transactions and, subject
to the requirements of _Section 6.5_ of the Agreement, no requirements or
conditions to mitigate any national security concerns shall have been imposed;

 



 

(c) there shall be instituted or pending any Action by any Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction that seeks, directly or indirectly, to (i)
make illegal, prohibit, materially delay or otherwise restrain the making of
