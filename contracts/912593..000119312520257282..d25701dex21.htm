ARTICLE II

 

 _THE TRANSACTIONS_

 

2.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein and in accordance with the Act, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company at the Effective Time, and the separate existence of Merger
Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall continue as the Surviving
Company (the "Surviving Company"). Immediately following the Closing, Parent
will cause the Acquired Companies to transfer certain assets (excluding any
Real Property) to Affiliates of Parent that are Taxable REIT Subsidiaries.

 

2.2 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, the closing of the Merger and the
other Transactions (other than the transfers of Delayed Consent Equity, as
applicable) shall take place by electronic mail and overnight courier service,
or by physical exchange of documentation at the offices of Jaffe Raitt Heuer
and Weiss, P.C., 27777 Franklin Rd., Suite 2500, Southfield, Michigan 48034 (in
either case, the "Closing"), on the date that is the third Business Day after
the date on which all conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ (except those
conditions that are to be satisfied or waived at Closing) have been satisfied
or waived by the party entitled to the benefit of the same, at 9:00 a.m.,
Central Time;  _provided_ that if such conditions are satisfied or waived
prior to October 30, 2020, the Closing shall take place on the last Business
Day of the month in which such conditions are satisfied or waived, or at such
other place, date and time as the parties shall mutually agree in writing
(the date on which the Closing occurs, the "Closing Date"); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Closing may occur remotely by e-mail or other manner as
may be mutually agreed upon by the parties. The Closing shall be effective as
of 11:59 p.m., Central Time, on the Closing Date, or, if the Closing Date is
October 30, 2020, as of 11:59 p.m., Central Time, on October 31, 2020 (the
"Reference Time").

2.3 _Effective Time and Effects of the Merger_. Prior to the Closing, the
parties shall prepare, and on the Closing Date shall file with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger or other
appropriate documents (in any such case, the "Certificate of
Merger") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act and
shall make all other filings or recordings required under the Act. The Merger
shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed
with such Secretary of State, or at such other time as Parent and the Company
shall agree in writing and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the
Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time"). The Merger shall have
the effects set forth in Section 18-209 of the Act.

 



20

    

2.4 _The Surviving Company_.

 

(a) _Organizational Documents_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.5(a)_, by
virtue of the Merger and pursuant to the Certificate of Merger, (i) the
certificate of formation of the Surviving Company shall be amended and
restated as of the Effective Time so as to contain the provisions, and only
the provisions, contained in the exhibit attached to the Certificate of
Merger and (ii) the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving
Company shall be amended and restated to read as the limited liability company
agreement of Merger Sub, except for any references to the name of Merger Sub.

(b) _Managers_. The managers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the managers of the Surviving Company, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

 

(c) _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

 

2.5 _Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) Subject to the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_, each
Security Holder may elect (an "Election"), in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.5(b)_, that a portion of the Closing Merger Consideration payable to such
Security Holder will be paid in a combination of (i) common units in SCOLP
(the "Common OP Units") and/or (ii) units of a new series of preferred units
in SCOLP (the "Preferred OP Units" and, together with the Common OP Units, the
"SCOLP Units"); _provided_ that the portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration payable in (A) SCOLP Units shall not exceed 15% of the Estimated
Purchase Price and (B) Preferred OP Units shall not exceed $75,000,000 in
value. If Elections made by the Security Holders exceed the limitations set
forth in the preceding sentence, such Elections shall be subject to cutback in
a manner reasonably determined by the Company. Parent is a REIT and is the
general partner of SCOLP. To the extent that a Security Holder elects
SCOLP Units (each, an "Electing Security Holder"), and subject to
satisfaction of the conditions for issuance described in _Section_ __ _
2.5(b)_, Parent shall cause SCOLP to issue such SCOLP Units in accordance
with this Agreement. In electing a portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration in SCOLP Units, the applicable Electing Security Holder shall
elect such portion that is capable of being divided equally on a per unit
basis by the number of Outstanding Class A Units to avoid the issuance of any
fractional SCOLP Units. The remaining balance of the Closing Merger
Consideration payable to such Electing Security Holder shall be paid in cash.
_Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules lists certain
Security Holders that have irrevocably elected whether or not to make the
Election and the portion of such Security Holders share of the Closing Merger
Consideration that each has elected to receive in the form of Common OP Units
and/or Preferred OP Units.

 



21

    

(b) The Company shall prepare and mail along with the
Information Statement a customary form of election (the "Election Form") to
the Security Holders, which Election Form shall be used by each Security
Holder who wishes to make an Election. Any Electing Security Holders Election
shall have been properly made only if the Company shall have received at its
designated office, by 5:00 p.m., Central Time, on a date prior to the
Effective Time to be mutually selected by Parent and the Company (the
"Election Deadline"), an Election Form properly completed and duly executed
by the Electing Security Holder. A Security Holder that has not made a valid
Election by the Election Deadline, that has revoked an Election prior to the
Election Deadline (other than Security Holders that have delivered an
irrevocable Election) or that fails to deliver an executed Lockup Agreement
and Investor Letter and Questionnaire prior to the Closing Date, shall be
treated as not having made an Election. Other than Security Holders that have
delivered an irrevocable Election, an Electing Security Holder may, at any
time prior to the Election Deadline, revoke or change such Electing Security
Holders Election by written notice received by the Company prior to the
Election Deadline, accompanied if applicable by a properly completed and duly
executed revised Election Form.

(c) Subject to the provisions of this _Article II_ , at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent
Parties (or their respective equityholders) or the Company or any of the
Security Holders:

 

(i) Each Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive, without
interest thereon:

A. with respect to each Outstanding Class A Unit, the Closing Per Unit
Merger Consideration, _plus_ , with respect to any Conversion Unit, the Class
B Preferred Preference Consideration for such Conversion Unit;

 

B. with respect to each Outstanding Class B Preferred Unit that is a Series
B-1 Preferred Unit, the Class B Preferred Preference Consideration for such
Series B-1 Preferred Unit _plus_ the product of (1) the Closing Per Unit
Merger Consideration and (2) 0.9090909; and

C. with respect to each Outstanding Class B Preferred Unit that is a
Series B-2 Preferred Unit, the Class B Preferred Preference Consideration for
such Series B-2 Preferred Unit _plus_ the product of (1) the Closing Per Unit
Merger Consideration and (2) 0.8333333.

(ii) Each Phantom Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that has vested in accordance with the terms of the applicable
award agreement shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive,
without interest thereon, the Closing Per Unit Merger Consideration.

(iii) Each Unit that is owned by the Parent Parties or any of their
respective Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

 



22

    

(iv) Each unit representing limited liability company interests in Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into one unit representing limited liability company interests of
the Surviving Company.

 

(v) All Units (as converted) will cease to represent any rights for the
holders thereof as members of the Company except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.5(c)_.

 

(d) The SCOLP Units to be issued pursuant to the terms hereof shall be
governed by that certain Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership
Agreement of SCOLP, dated as of January 31, 2019, as amended or restated from
time to time (the "Partnership Agreement"). The rights and preferences of the
Preferred OP Units shall be as set forth in the form of amendment to the
Partnership Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit N_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement or the Partnership Agreement, distributions
payable on the SCOLP Units for the quarter in which the Closing occurs shall
be prorated based on the number of days elapsed in such quarter through the
Closing Date as compared to the total number of days in such quarter. On or
prior to the Closing Date, any Security Holders receiving SCOLP Units
shall execute and deliver such customary investment, subscription and joinder
documents as SCOLP shall reasonably require in connection with the issuance of
the SCOLP Units.

 

2.6 _Treatment of Incentive Awards_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in any
event prior to the Effective Time, the Board (or, if appropriate, any duly
authorized committee of the Board) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions (including obtaining any required consents) as may be necessary
or required to give effect to the following:

 

(i) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holders thereof, each award of Restricted Units that is
outstanding as of immediately prior the Effective Time shall, to the extent

shall become Outstanding Class A Units subject to treatment as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.5(c)(i)(A)_.

 

(ii) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holders thereof, each Phantom Unit that is outstanding as

2.12 _Tax Treatment_.

 

(a) _Purchase Price Allocation_. The parties agree that the Closing Merger
Consideration (including all other amounts treated as consideration for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) shall be allocated among assets of each Acquired
Company pursuant to the methodologies set forth on _Section_ __ _ 2.12_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedules (the "Purchase Price Methodologies"), and an
allocation schedule shall be prepared after the Closing as provided in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.12_ in accordance with the Purchase Price Methodologies
and Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (the "Purchase Price Allocation"). The parties agree that, for Tax
purposes, including for purposes of determining the amount of money or fair
market value of property received by the Security Holders that is
attributable to unrealized receivables or inventory pursuant to Section 751(a)
of the Code, the Purchase Price Methodologies shall be determinative. Within
90 days after the determination of the post-Closing adjustments to the
Purchase Price pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.15_, Parent shall deliver a copy
of its initial determination of the Purchase Price Allocation to Seller
Representative. Seller Representative shall, within 30 days after receipt of
the initial determination of the Purchase Price Allocation from Parent, notify
Parent if Seller Representative disagrees with such initial determination, and
if Seller Representative does not so notify Parent within such 30 day period,
the initial Purchase Price Allocation shall be final and binding on the
parties. If Seller Representative disagrees with such initial Purchase Price
Allocation, Parent and Seller Representative shall make a good faith effort
to resolve the dispute. If Parent and Seller Representative have been unable
to resolve their differences within 30 days after Parent has been notified of
Seller Representatives disagreement with the initial Purchase
Price Allocation, then Seller Representative and Parent shall each be
entitled to adopt their own positions regarding the allocation of the Purchase
Price among the assets of the Acquired Companies for federal income tax
purposes. If the parties agree on the allocation schedule (or such is deemed
accepted or rendered final), Parent and Sellers Representative and each
Security Holder agree (i) that no party will take a position on any Tax
Return, before any Governmental Entity charged with the collection of any
Tax, or in any judicial proceeding, that is in any way inconsistent with the
Purchase Price Allocation; _provided_ , _however_ ,

 



28

    

 that neither party shall be unreasonably impeded in its ability and
discretion to negotiate, compromise and/or settle any Tax audit, claim or
similar proceedings in connection with such allocation and (ii) in the event
that any adjustment is required to be made to the Purchase Price Allocation as
a result of an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement,
Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and shall provide to Seller
Representative, a revised Purchase Price Allocation reflecting such
adjustment. In the event that a revised Purchase Price Allocation is required
to be prepared, it shall be subject to review and resolution of timely
raised disputes in the same manner as the initial Purchase Price Allocation.

(b) _Tax Treatment of Merger_. Except as otherwise required by law, the
parties shall treat the Merger, for all applicable tax reporting purposes as
an "assets over merger" of the Company with and into SCOLP, with SCOLP being
treated as the continuing partnership under Section 708 of the Code and
Treasury Regulation Section 1.708-1(c)(3)(i). Consistent with this treatment,
the parties shall treat the Merger as (i) a sale by the Selling Security
Holders of all or a portion of their Units in the Company to SCOLP in
exchange for cash and (ii) for the Electing Security Holders a tax-deferred
contribution of their Units in the Company (not otherwise sold for cash) in
exchange for SCOLP Units under Section 721 of the Code. No party shall take
any position inconsistent with such treatment.

2.13 _Pre-Closing Restructuring; Delayed Consents_.

(a) On the date that is three Business Days prior to the Closing, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a schedule that sets forth each Delayed
Consent and, with respect to each such Delayed Consent, (i) the applicable
Delayed Consent Lease, (ii) the applicable Delayed Consent Subsidiary, (iii)
the applicable Delayed Consent Property, (iv) the Attributable Property Value
for each Delayed Consent Property (the "Delayed Consent Schedule") and (v) a
list of the Optional Delayed Consent Leases for which the consent of the
counterparty to such Optional Delayed Consent Leases has not been obtained. If
requested by Parent in writing within 24 hours following delivery of the
Delayed Consent Schedule, the Delayed Consent Schedule shall be updated to
include any Optional Delayed Consent Lease for which the consent of the
counterparty to such Optional Delayed Consent Lease has not been obtained
prior to delivery of the Delayed Consent Schedule. Following delivery of the
Delayed Consent Schedule and on the Closing Date but prior to the Closing,
the Company will consummate a restructuring ("Restructuring") pursuant to
which the issued and outstanding Equity Securities of the Delayed
Consent Subsidiaries (the "Delayed Consent Equity") will be transferred and
assigned to Sailor Newco, which is a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company,
and the Equity Securities of Sailor Newco will be distributed _pro rata_ to
the Security Holders.

(b) With respect to each Delayed Consent, from and after the Closing
through the earlier of (i) the applicable Delayed Consent Approval Date (with
respect to any Delayed Consent that is not required pursuant to an Optional
Delayed Consent Lease) or November 30, 2020 (with respect to any Delayed
Consent that is required pursuant to an Optional Delayed Consent Lease) and
(ii) the Delayed Consent Deadline, each of Sailor Newco, Seller
Representative, the Surviving Company and Parent shall (A) use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain such Delayed Consent as quickly
as possible, (B) cooperate with the other parties in executing any additional
instruments reasonably requested by another party necessary to obtain such
Delayed Consent, (C) provide such information or documentation as may be
requested by the

 



29

    

 lessor of the Delayed Consent Property in connection with considering the
request for consent, and (D) keep the other parties reasonably apprised of the
status of any negotiations with the lessor of the Delayed Consent Property.
The request for each Delayed Consent shall be in substantially the forms
attached hereto as _Exhibit I_ for the respective Delayed Consent Property or,
if any material changes are requested by Sailor Newco or Seller
Representative, on the one hand, or the Surviving Company or Parent, on the
other hand, with such changes as are consented to (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) by Parent or Seller
Representative, respectively; _provided_ , that, to the extent an Acquired
Company received a consent pursuant to a Delayed Consent Lease in connection
with the acquisition of the applicable Delayed Consent Property by the
Acquired Company, the request for such Delayed Consent may be in
substantially the same form as the original consent (with, other than for a
Required Estoppel Lease, all estoppel language deleted from such form if
requested by the counterparty to such Delayed Consent Lease)
without additional consents required by the parties. Each party shall bear
its own costs and expenses (including for its attorneys, accountants and other
advisors) in connection with obtaining the Delayed Consents; _provided_ , that
any costs and expenses that are incurred by or on behalf of the Surviving
Company in connection with obtaining the Delayed Consents shall be borne by
the Surviving Company and shall not be deemed Transaction Expenses; _provided,
further, however_ , (1) the Surviving Company may, but shall not be required,
to make any payments to a third Person or agree to any changes or amendments
to any Delayed Consent Lease in connection with obtaining any such Delayed
Consent, (2) the Surviving Company shall agree to financial concessions as
Seller Representative shall deem necessary to obtain a Delayed Consent (other
than Delayed Consents that are required pursuant to Optional Delayed Consent
Leases, it being agreed that any financial concessions required with respect
to Optional Delayed Consent Leases shall be borne by the Surviving Company and
subject to the Surviving Companys approval and consent) and (3) the Surviving
Company shall agree to such non-financial changes or amendments to each
Delayed Consent Lease as do not materially interfere with the ownership, use
or operation of the Delayed Consent Property, it being agreed that (x) any
non-financial changes or amendments that materially interfere with the
ownership, use or operation of a Delayed Consent Property not underlying an
Optional Delayed Consent Lease shall be subject to the Surviving Companys
approval and consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed
(determined in the context of the materiality of the interference), and (y)
any non-financial changes or amendments that materially interfere with the
ownership, use or operation of a Delayed Consent Property underlying an
Optional Delayed Consent Lease shall be subject to the Surviving Companys
approval and consent;  _provided_ , that any payments to a third Person and
the impact of such changes, amendments or concessions, other than as approved
by Parent in connection with obtaining any Delayed Consents that are required
pursuant to Optional Delayed Consent Leases, as applicable, shall be taken
into account in the calculation of the Attributable Property Value Adjustment
Amount in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules.

 

(c) During the period from the Closing until the earlier of (i) the
transfer of the Delayed Consent Equity in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.13(d)_ and (ii) the termination of the Interim Operating Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Surviving Company shall continue to operate the
Delayed Consent Property in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Interim Operating
Agreement. The Surviving Company shall collect all revenues, pay all expenses
and remit all income associated with the operation of such Delayed Consent
Property in accordance with the terms of the Interim Operating Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, during the period from the Closing until the
earlier of

 



30

    

 (A) the transfer of the Delayed Consent Equity in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.13(d)_ and (B) the Delayed Consent Deadline, Sailor Newco shall not,
and where applicable shall cause each Delayed Consent Subsidiary not to,
except (1) as permitted, contemplated or required by the Interim Operating
Agreement or by applicable Laws or (2) as Parent otherwise consents to in
writing, in its sole discretion:

 

(i) sell, lease, transfer, or assign any material tangible assets of a
Delayed Consent Subsidiary, other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice;

(ii) grant any material license or sublicense of any rights under or with
respect to any Intellectual Property of a Delayed Consent Subsidiary other
than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

 

(iii) permit a Delayed Consent Subsidiary to incur or guaranty any material
Indebtedness;

 

(iv) make or authorize any material change in any Organizational Document
of any Delayed Consent Subsidiary;

 

(v) issue, sell, or otherwise dispose of any of Equity Securities of any
Delayed Consent Subsidiary, or grant any options, warrants, or other rights
to purchase or obtain (including upon conversion, exchange, or exercise) any
of Equity Securities of any Delayed Consent Subsidiary;

 

(vi) take any action that would, or fail to take any action, the failure of
which to be taken would, reasonably be expected to cause any Delayed Consent
Subsidiary to cease to be treated as a partnership or disregarded entity for
federal income tax purposes;

 

(vii) permit any Delayed Consent Subsidiary to enter into any new line of
business or abandon or discontinue any material existing line of business;

(viii) request a Tax ruling, change any method of Tax accounting or method
of reporting income or deductions for Tax or accounting purposes, make,
change or rescind any Tax election, amend any material Tax Return, or settle
or compromise any material Tax liability audit, claim or assessment, enter
into any closing agreement related to material Taxes, waive or extend the
statute of limitations in respect of any material Taxes (other than pursuant
to extensions of time to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course of
business), or knowingly surrender any right to claim any material Tax refund,
in each case, with respect to any Delayed Consent Subsidiary;

(ix) adopt any plan of merger, consolidation, reorganization, liquidation
or dissolution for any Delayed Consent Subsidiary, file a petition in
bankruptcy under any provisions of federal or state bankruptcy Law for any
Delayed Consent Subsidiary or consent to the filing of any bankruptcy
petition under any similar Law for any Delayed Consent Subsidiary; and

 



31

    

(x) legally obligate itself to do any of the actions described in the
foregoing _clauses (i)_ through _(ix)_. __

(d) Within two Business Days after the final determination of the amount
payable by Parent with respect to a Delayed Consent Subsidiary in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.14_ (or, with respect to a Delayed Consent Subsidiary
that is party to an Optional Delayed Consent Lease, on November 30, 2020),
Sailor Newco and the Surviving Company shall deliver (or cause to be
delivered) to each other a duly executed copy of the applicable Delayed
Consent Subsidiary Purchase Agreement, and each of Seller
Representative, Sailor Newco and the Surviving Company shall cooperate with
each other in executing (or causing to be executed) such other documentation
as may be required to consummate each such transfer of Delayed Consent Equity,
free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens). Concurrently with
the execution and delivery of each Delayed Consent Subsidiary Purchase
Agreement, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, an amount that is equal to
(i) the Attributable Property Value for the applicable Delayed Consent
Property, _minus_ (ii) if applicable, the Attributable Property Value
Adjustment Amount to Seller Representative (on behalf of the Security Holders
for distribution to each such Security Holder in accordance with its Pro Rata
Share thereof) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
designated in writing to Parent, _minus_ (iii) the Optional Delayed Consent
Debt Repayment Amount, if any, _plus_ (iv) the amount, if any, by which the
Net Working Capital of the applicable Delayed Consent Subsidiary exceeds the
Proportionate Target Net Working Capital for such Delayed Consent Subsidiary;
_minus_ (v) the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital of the
applicable Delayed Consent Subsidiary is less than the Proportionate Target
Net Working Capital for such Delayed Consent Subsidiary (the amount set forth
in _clauses (iv)_ and _(v)_ , as applicable, the "Delayed Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount"). The parties agree to treat each assignment of
Delayed Consent Equity as a sale of the assets of each such Delayed Consent
Subsidiary and further agree to report all Tax consequences consistent with
such treatment.

2.14 _Attributable Property Value Adjustments_. Within two Business Days
after each Delayed Consent Approval Date, with respect to each Delayed
Consent, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to, deliver to Seller Representative reasonably detailed calculations
of the corresponding Attributable Property Value Adjustment Amount (if
applicable) and the Delayed Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount. Seller
Representative shall have five Business Days following delivery of such
calculations to review and either accept or dispute such calculations.
If Seller Representative timely disputes the calculation of the Attributable
Property Value Adjustment Amount (if applicable) or the Delayed Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount, Seller Representative and the Surviving Company
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, promptly endeavor in
good faith to resolve any disagreement as to such calculation. If the
Surviving Company and Seller Representative are unable to resolve in writing
any disagreement as to the calculation of the Attributable Property Value
Adjustment Amount (if applicable) or the Delayed Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount within ten Business Days, then the amounts in dispute will
be promptly referred to the Accountants for final arbitration,
which arbitration shall be completed within 30 days after the matter is
submitted to the Accountants, and which arbitration shall be final, binding
and non-appealable. The Accountants shall act as an arbitrator to determine,
based solely on presentations and submissions by the Surviving Company and
Seller Representative (which presentations and submissions shall be made to
the Accountants no later than 15 days after the engagement of the 

 



32

    

 Accountants), and not by independent review, only those amounts still in
dispute in accordance with the definitions of Attributable Property Value
Adjustment Amount and Delayed Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount set forth
herein. In resolving any disputed item, the Accountants may not assign a value
to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either
party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party.
The Accountants shall have full authority to resolve all issues relating to
the Attributable Property Value Adjustment Amount (if applicable) and the
Delayed Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount pursuant to this  _Section_ __
_ 2.14_ (including procedural, legal, factual and accounting issues). Seller
Representative and the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to, execute, if requested by the Accountants, a reasonable
engagement letter. The fees and expenses of the Accountants shall be allocated
between the Surviving Company and Seller Representative (on behalf of the
Security Holders, severally, and not jointly, in accordance with each
Security Holders Pro Rata Share), so that Seller Representatives share of
such fees and expenses shall be equal to the product of (i) the aggregate
amount of such fees and expenses, and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the amount in dispute that is ultimately unsuccessfully disputed by Seller
Representative (as determined by the Accountants) and the denominator of which
is the total amount in dispute submitted to arbitration. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the process set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.14_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties
for any disputes related to the calculation of the Attributable Property Value
Adjustment Amount (if applicable) and the Delayed Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount. The rights and obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
2.14_ shall also apply to calculation of the Delayed Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount for any Delayed Consent that is required by an Optional
Delayed Consent Lease, except that the Surviving Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to, deliver to Seller Representative a
reasonably detailed estimate of the Delayed Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount reasonably in advance of November 30, 2020 and Seller Representative
and the Surviving Company shall cooperate with respect to any disputes with
respect to such estimate and the final calculation of the Delayed Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount, and the payment of any amounts owing to or from
such parties shall be made pursuant to the applicable Delayed Consent
Subsidiary Purchase Agreement.

 

2.15 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable and in any event within 90 days after the
Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to Seller Representative a
statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail its
good faith calculation of (i) the Net Working Capital (calculated without
reference to the Delayed Consent Subsidiaries), (ii) the Closing
Indebtedness, (iii) the Transaction Expenses, (iv) the Pipeline Acquisition
Costs, (v) the Cash Amount and (vi) the resulting calculation of the Purchase
Price.

 

(b) Seller Representative shall have 45 days following delivery of the
Closing Statement to review and either accept or dispute the Closing
Statement and the calculations set forth therein. If Seller Representative
disputes any amounts reflected on the Closing Statement, it shall deliver to
Parent a statement setting forth its objections thereto, setting forth,
in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute, the dollar amounts involved
and Seller Representatives calculation of the adjustments to the Closing
Statement that Seller Representative believes should be made, within 45 days
of delivery of the Closing Statement to Seller Representative (such written
notice of objection, the "Objection Statement"). If an Objection Statement is
not delivered to

 



33

    

 Parent within the time period required by the preceding sentence, then the
Closing Statement (as delivered by Parent to Seller Representative), as
modified to include any changes agreed to by Seller Representative and
Parent, shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto.

 

(c) If Seller Representative timely delivers an Objection Statement to
Parent, Seller Representative and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any objections made by Seller Representative, but if they do not reach
a final resolution within 30 days (or such longer period as may be agreed by
Seller Representative and Parent) after the delivery of the Objection
Statement, Seller Representative and Parent shall submit the items remaining
in dispute for final resolution to the Accountants for final arbitration.
Promptly following the submission of the items in dispute to the Accountants,
and in any event within ten Business Days following such submission, each of
Parent and Seller Representative shall submit to the Accountants (and the
other party) all documentary materials and analyses that Parent or Seller
Representative, as the case may be, believes to be relevant to a resolution
of the disputed items set forth in the Objection Statement. The Accountants
shall render their determination of all disputed items submitted for
resolution within 30 days after receipt of all submissions by Parent and
Seller Representative to the Accountants, and such determination shall be
final, binding and non-appealable absent bad faith or manifest error. The
Accountants shall, acting as experts in accounting and not as arbitrators,
determine in a manner consistent with the requirements of this Agreement
(including the Accounting Principles), based solely on written presentations
and written submissions by Parent and Seller Representative
(which presentations and submissions shall be made to the Accountants no
later than 15 days after the engagement of the Accountants), and not by
independent review, whether those items identified by Seller Representative on
the Objection Statement that were submitted to the Accountants, and any
resulting adjustments, were properly calculated in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement (including the Accounting Principles). In resolving any
disputed item, the Accountants may not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party. Neither Parent nor
Seller Representative shall engage in any _ex parte_ communications with the
Accountants. Seller Representative and Parent shall promptly execute, if
reasonably requested by the Accountants, a commercially reasonable engagement
letter. The fees and expenses of the Accountants shall be allocated between
the Surviving Company and Seller Representative (on behalf of the Security
Holders, severally, and not jointly, in accordance with each Security Holders
Pro Rata Share), so that each such partys share of such fees and expenses
shall be equal to the product of (A) the aggregate amount of such fees and
expenses and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount in dispute
that is ultimately resolved in the other partys favor pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.15_ (as finally determined by the Accountants) and the
denominator of which is the total amount of the disputed items submitted to
the Accountants.

 

(d) No later than five Business Days after the Purchase Price has been
finally determined in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.15_, the
parties agree to the following payments (if any):

 

(i) If the Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price,
Parent shall pay the amount of such excess to Seller Representative (on
behalf of the Security Holders for distribution to each such Security Holder
in accordance with its Pro Rata Share thereof) and all funds in the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Account shall be released to Seller Representative
(on behalf of the Security Holders for distribution to each such Security
Holder in accordance with its Pro Rata Share thereof).

 



34

    

(ii) If the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than the Purchase Price,
(A) the amount of such excess (the "Purchase Price Overpayment") shall be
released to Parent from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account and (B)
all remaining funds in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account shall be
released to Seller Representative (on behalf of the Security Holders for
distribution to each such Security Holder in accordance with its Pro Rata
Share thereof). Except as provided in the next sentence, the payment of funds
from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.15(d)(ii)_ shall be Parents sole and exclusive remedy for
any adjustments to the Purchase Price contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _
2.15_, and if the Purchase Price Overpayment would otherwise exceed the
remaining funds at the time of such adjustments from the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account, Parent and the Acquired Companies shall have no
recourse against the Security Holders or their Affiliates for such excess.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document, Parent may offset against any consideration payable to Sailor Newco
under the Delayed Consent Subsidiary Purchase Agreements any amount by which
the Purchase Price Overpayment exceeds the funds in the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account.

 

(iii) If the Purchase Price is equal to the Estimated Purchase Price, all
funds in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account shall be released to
Seller Representative (on behalf of the Security Holders for distribution to
each such Security Holder in accordance with its Pro Rata Share thereof).

 

(e) Any payment to be made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.15_ shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account (or
accounts) specified in writing by Seller Representative or Parent, as
applicable. Promptly following final determination of the Purchase Price in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.15_, Parent and Seller Representative
hereby agree to deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
release from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account, in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement, the funds to be delivered in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.15(d)_. The parties acknowledge and agree that, with respect to any
payments to be made by Seller Representative to the Security Holders pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.15_, Seller Representative shall be entitled to
rely on the instructions provided by the Security Holders, and any deliveries
made by Seller Representative in accordance with such instructions based on
each Security Holders Pro Rata Share will be deemed to have been made in
accordance with this Agreement. Seller Representative shall have no
obligations to make, or cause to be made, any distributions of the amounts
described in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.15_ to the Security Holders in excess of
the funds actually received by Seller Representative from Parent or the Escrow
Agent, as applicable, in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

2.16 _Withholding_. Each of Parent, SCOLP, its Affiliates and, effective
upon the Closing, the Surviving Company each be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of Law; _provided_ that, except with respect
to compensatory payments, __ Parent shall not withhold or deduct from any
amount

 



35

    

 otherwise payable to a Security Holder pursuant to this Agreement if such
Security Holder has provided the certifications described in _Section_ __ _
2.11(a)(v)_. If Parent determines that it is required by Law to deduct and
withhold from any amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, then
Parent shall provide three Business Days notice to Seller Representative
prior to deducting and withholding such amount. If any amount otherwise
payable under this Agreement is deducted or withheld and paid over to a
Governmental Entity, then such amount shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person with respect to which such
deduction or withholding was imposed.

ARTICLE III

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 

Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedules, the Company hereby
makes the representations and warranties contained in this  _Article III_,
subject, in each case, to the Companys Knowledge, to Parent and SCOLP:

 

3.1 _Organization, Good Standing and Other Matters; Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) The Company is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite
limited liability company power and authority to own and lease its properties
and to carry on its business as now being conducted. _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedules sets forth each jurisdiction in which the
Company is licensed or qualified to do business. The Company is duly qualified
to conduct its business as currently conducted in each jurisdiction in which

connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any obligations of the Acquired Companies which become
due or payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with,
or as a result of, this Agreement), and to pay all related fees and expenses
of the Parent Parties and the Acquired Companies. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, each Parent Party affirms that it is not a condition to the
Closing or to any of its obligations under this Agreement that Parent, SCOLP
or any of their Affiliates (or the Surviving Company) obtain financing for or
related to any of the Transactions.

4.9 _Solvency_. No Parent Party is entering into this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors.
Immediately after giving effect to all of the Transactions, including the
making of the payments contemplated by _Article II_ , and assuming
satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the
Merger as set forth herein, the accuracy of the representations and warranties
of the Company set forth herein and the performance by the Company of its
obligations hereunder in all material respects, the Company will be Solvent.

4.10 _Activities of Merger Sub_. SCOLP owns beneficially and of record all
of the outstanding equity interests of Merger Sub, free and clear of any and
all Liens, other than Liens resulting from this Agreement. Merger Sub was
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions and has not
engaged in any business activities or conducted any operations other than in
connection with the Transactions.

4.11 _R andW Policy_. Attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ is a true, correct and
complete copy of (a) the binder agreement for the RandW Policy, (b) the form of
the RandW Policy attached to such binder agreement and (c) the no claims
declaration delivered in connection with the inception of the RandW Policy. The
binder agreement for the RandW Policy is in full force and effect and is a
legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent, and to Parents
Knowledge, the insurer(s) party thereto, except as enforcement may be limited
by the Enforceability Exceptions and except insofar as the availability of
equitable remedies may be limited by applicable Law.

 

4.12 _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or formally threatened in
writing against any Parent Party or involving any of their properties or
assets that would be reasonably be expected to (a) have a material adverse
effect on the ability of any Parent Party to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or (b) otherwise prevent, hinder or delay the consummation of
the Transactions.

4.13 _Taxes_.

 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed all income and
other material Tax Returns required to be filed by it (taking into account
any extension of time to file), and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and
complete in all material respects.

 

(b) All income and other material Taxes required to be paid by Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries have been fully and timely paid.

(c) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries are currently the subject of
an audit or other examination relating to a material amount of Taxes, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries have received written notice from any
Governmental Entity that an audit or examination will be initiated or is
pending and, to Parents Knowledge, no threatened audit or examination
exists.

 



56

    

(d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by,
or has any obligation under, any Tax allocation, indemnity or sharing
agreement or similar Contract or has any other obligation to indemnify any
other Person with respect to Taxes that will be in effect after the Closing.

 

(e) There are no Liens (other than Permitted Liens) with respect to Taxes
on any of the assets of any Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

(f) Each Subsidiary of Parent that is a partnership, joint venture or
limited liability company and that has not elected to be a "taxable REIT
subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code (each, a "Taxable
REIT Subsidiary") has been since its formation or acquisition by Parent
treated for United States federal income tax purposes as a partnership,
disregarded entity, or "qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of
Section 856(i)(2) of the Code (each, a "Qualified REIT Subsidiary"), as the
case may be, and not as a corporation or an association taxable as a
corporation whose separate existence is respected for federal income tax
purposes.

 

(g) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have complied, in all material
respects, with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of
Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445,
1446 and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any state and foreign
Laws) and have duly and timely withheld and, in each case, have paid over to
the appropriate taxing authorities all material amounts required to be so
withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof under all
applicable Laws.

 

(h) Neither Parent nor has any of its Subsidiaries, waived any statute of
limitations in respect of income or other material Taxes or agreed to any
extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, which waiver
or extension is still in effect, and no request for any such waiver or
extension is currently pending.

 

(i) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a
"reportable transaction" as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4
(or a transaction under any similar provision of state, local, or foreign
Laws).

 

(j) Since its inception, Parent and its Subsidiaries have not incurred (i)
any material liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(1), 857(b)(4),
857(b)(5), 857(b)(6)(A), 857(b)(7), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code which have not
been previously paid, (ii) any liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(5)
(for income test violations), 856(c)(7)(C) (for asset test violations), or
856(g)(5)(C) (for violations of other qualification requirements applicable to
REITs) and (iii) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
material liability for Tax other than (A) in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, or (B) transfer or similar Taxes arising in
connection with sales of property. No event has occurred, and to Parents
Knowledge no condition or circumstances exists, which presents a material
risk that any material liability for Taxes described _clause (i)_ or _(iii)_
of the preceding sentence or any liability for Taxes described in _clause
(ii)_ of the preceding sentence will be imposed upon Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 



57

    

(k) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two years prior
to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could otherwise
constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the Transactions.

(l) Parent (i) for all taxable years commencing with Parents year ending
December 31, 1993 and through December 31, 2019, has been subject to taxation
as a real estate investment trust within the meaning of Section 856 of the
Code (a "REIT") and has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for
such years; (ii) has operated since January 1, 2016 to the date hereof, in a
manner consistent with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a
REIT; (iii) intends to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a
REIT for its taxable year that will include the day of the Merger; and (iv)
has not taken or omitted to take any action that could reasonably be expected
to result in a challenge by the IRS or any other governmental authority to its
status as a REIT, and no such challenge is pending or threatened, to Parents
Knowledge. No Subsidiary of Parent is a corporation for United States
federal income tax purposes, other than a corporation that qualifies as a
Qualified REIT Subsidiary or as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary. Parents dividends
paid deduction, within the meaning of Section 561 of the Code, for each
taxable year, taking into account any dividends subject to Sections 857(b)(8)
or 858 of the Code, has not been less than the sum of (i) Parents REIT
taxable income, as defined in Section 857(b)(2) of the Code, determined
without regard to any dividends paid deduction for such year and (ii)
Parents net capital gain for such year.

4.14 _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

(a) Except for the representations and warranties contained in this 
_Article IV_ , no Parent Party, nor any other Person on behalf of any Parent
Party, makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to the Parent Parties or with respect to any other information
provided to the Acquired Companies or their Representatives, including with

Transactions, or in respect of any other matter or thing whatsoever, and no
Affiliate or Representative of the Parent Parties has any authority, express
or implied, to make any representations, warranties or agreements not
specifically set forth in this Agreement, and the Parent Parties disclaim any
other representations or warranties, whether made by the Parent Parties or any
of their respective Affiliates or Representatives. No Parent Party nor
any other Person will have or be subject to any liability to an Acquired
Company or any other Person resulting from the distribution to the Acquired
Companies or the Acquired Companies use of, any such information, 

 



58

    

 including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other
material made available to the Acquired Companies or their Representatives in
any "data rooms," "virtual data rooms," management presentations or in any
other form in expectation of, or in connection with, the Transactions, or in
respect of any other matter or thing whatsoever (electronic or otherwise) or
otherwise in expectation of the Transactions. 

(b) Other than the specific representations and warranties expressly set
forth in _Article III_ , the Parent Parties specifically disclaim that they
are relying upon or have relied upon any such other representations or
warranties that may have been made by any Person, and acknowledge and agree
that the Acquired Companies and their Affiliates have specifically disclaimed

any information not specifically required to be provided or disclosed
pursuant to the specific representations and warranties set forth in _Article
III_.

5.2 _Credit Agreement and Financing Sources Cooperation_.

reasonable prior notice in connection with (x) the arrangement of the Debt

Closing.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the

5.2_ for all purposes hereunder, and Parent shall not allege that any Acquired
Company is not or has not been in compliance with this  _Section_ __ _ 5.2_

been cured on or prior to the Outside Date.

reasonable efforts to deliver to each Security Holder reasonably in advance
of the Election Deadline an information statement (the "Information
Statement") in accordance with any requirements of the Organizational
Documents of the Company or applicable Law describing the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement in reasonable detail and information relating
to the business, finances and operations of Parent and to the offer and sale
of the SCOLP Units to the Electing Security Holders which Parent
shall determine; _ provided_ that no later than five Business Days prior to
the delivery of the Information Statement to the Security Holders, Parent
shall be afforded an opportunity to review and comment on the draft
Information Statement, and thereafter Parent and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to agree on a final form of the Information
Statement and shall in good faith consider and incorporate any reasonable
comments made by the other party to such draft Information Statement. The
Parent Parties shall be solely responsible for any information included or
incorporated by reference in the Information Statement as to (a) the business,
finances and operations of Parent and (b) the Public Filings, and the Company
shall not have any liability for the Investor Letter and Questionnaire, the
Registration Questionnaire or the Registration Rights Agreement.

receiving SCOLP Units.

 

5.5 _Access to Information and Real Property_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, at all times

shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (a) permit Parent and its Representatives to

hours, to the Books and Records of the Acquired Companies and their respective
businesses under the supervision of 

 



64

    

 Acquired Company personnel, (b) make reasonably available any executives and
employees of the Acquired Companies, and (c) furnish to Parent such
information and data, financial records and other documents in its possession
relating to the Acquired Companies and their respective businesses and assets,
in each case, as Parent may reasonably request and which are reasonably
necessary in connection with Parents due diligence investigation of the
Acquired Companies and their respective businesses and assets; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) all requests by Parent shall be made through such Person
or Persons as the Company may designate from time to time, (ii) such
activities do not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or
operations of the Acquired Companies, (iii) nothing in this _Section_ __ _
5.5(a)_ shall require any Acquired Company to furnish to Parent or provide
Parent with access to information (A) to the extent related to the sale or
divestiture process conducted by the Company and the Security Holders vis-a-
vis any Person other than Parent and its Affiliates, (B) that is subject to an
attorney-client or an attorney work-product privilege or (C) that legal
counsel for any Acquired Company reasonably concludes may not be disclosed
pursuant to applicable Law.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, at all times during the period commencing on the
date hereof and terminating upon the earlier of Closing, the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of _Section_ __ _
8.5_ or, with respect to any Delayed Consent Property, the date of transfer
of the Delayed Consent Equity for such Delayed Consent Subsidiary in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.13(d)_, the Company shall provide Parent and
its consultants reasonable access to the Owned Real Property and, subject to
any required lessor consent (which the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain), provide Parent and its consultants access to
the Leased Real Property, in each case, to conduct a Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment of the Real Property as has not been completed
prior to the date hereof and that Parent may reasonably request; _provided,
however_ , that Parent shall not conduct any intrusive environmental
investigation at any Real Property, including any sampling, testing or other
intrusive indoor or outdoor investigation of soil, subsurface strata, surface
water, groundwater, sediments or ambient air or other media at or in
connection with any such Real Property. Such access to the Real Property
shall be scheduled with the cooperation of the Company. All such
investigations shall be at Parents cost and expense. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parents satisfaction with the results of such investigations shall not
be a closing condition.

5.6 _Company Permits_. Prior to Closing, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents, waivers and approvals
from any Governmental Entity required under each Company Permit in connection
with the Transactions, except those consents, waivers and approvals which, if
not obtained, would not, or would not reasonably be expected to, result in
material liability to the Acquired Companies or materially and adversely
affect the operation of the applicable Owned Real Property or Leased Real
Property, as the case may be. All such consents, waivers and approvals shall
be delivered to the Parent Parties as and when obtained.

changes, amendments or concessions as it deems necessary to obtain the consent
of, or waiver of any right of first refusal by, the applicable lessor in
connection with the Transactions if the Base Purchase Price is reduced by an
amount equal to the financial impact of such changes, amendments or
concessions, as determined in a manner consistent with the determination of
Attributable Property Value Adjustment Amounts as set forth in _Section_ __ _
1.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules (it being agreed that, with
respect to any Real Property underlying an Optional Delayed Consent Lease, any
financial changes, amendments or concessions shall be borne by Parent and
shall not reduce the Base Purchase Price but shall require the consent of
Parent), and (b) non-financial changes or amendments to any Real Property
Lease as it deems necessary to obtain the consent of, or waiver of any right
of first refusal by, the applicable counterparty in connection with the
Transactions, it being agreed that any such non-financial change or amendment
that materially interferes with the ownership, use or operation of the
applicable Real Property shall be subject to Parents approval and consent,
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (determined in the
context of the materiality of the interference as applicable) (it being agreed
that any non-financial changes or amendments that materially interfere
with the ownership, use or operation of the Real Property underlying an
Optional Delayed Consent Lease shall be subject to Parents approval and
consent).

(and only upon) the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
automatically terminate and none of the parties thereto shall have any further
liability or obligation thereunder except with respect to any confidential
information provided to or obtained by the Parent Parties or their
Representatives concerning the Security Holders, which information shall

ARTICLE VII

 

 _COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY_

 

7.1 _Public Announcements_. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, except to the extent required by any applicable Law, no party
nor any of its respective Affiliates or Representatives shall, directly or
indirectly, issue any press release or public announcement of any kind without
the prior written consent of Parent (in the case of Seller Representative,
Sailor Newco or the Company) or the Company (in the case of the Parent
Parties), as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and its
Subsidiaries may make announcements from time to time to their
respective employees, customers, suppliers and other business relations and
otherwise as the Company may reasonably determine is necessary to comply with
applicable Law or the requirements of this Agreement (including _Section_ __ _
7.2_ and obtaining consents of lessors pursuant to the Real Property Leases)
or any other agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, no party nor any of its
respective Affiliates or Representatives shall, directly or indirectly, make
any disclosure to any third parties concerning the Transactions (including the
existence or terms thereof) without the prior written consent of Parent (in
the case of Seller Representative, Sailor Newco or the Company) or the
Company (in the case of the Parent Parties), as applicable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any party and its Affiliates may disclose such information
(a) to its Representatives and members as is necessary in the ordinary course

obligations under this Agreement (including _Section_ __ _ 7.2_) or (e) to
bona fide investors for fund raising, marketing or reporting purposes so long

disclosure is required by any applicable Law (including to comply with any
regulation promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
applicable to Parent) in the reasonable opinion of counsel, the party
required to make such announcement, release or disclosure may do so as long as
Parent and the Company consult prior to the making thereof and use their
reasonable best efforts to agree upon a mutually satisfactory text.

 



68

    

7.2 _Antitrust Approvals_.

 

(a) The Company and Parent shall as promptly as practicable and before the
expiration of any relevant legal deadline, but in no event later than ten
Business Days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, file, or
cause to be filed, with the United States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and
the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") the
notification and report form required for the Transactions and any
supplemental information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR
Act. Each of the parties shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to each
others counsel such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the
other may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or
submission that is necessary under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws.
Parent and the Company (as a Transaction Expense) shall each be responsible
for 50% of all filing fees payable in connection with such filings and for any
local counsel fees.

 

(b) The Company and Parent shall (and to the extent applicable, shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to) use their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain or take, as applicable, or cause to be obtained or taken, as
applicable, as promptly as practicable but, in any event, no later than the
Outside Date: (i) all necessary approvals under the HSR Act any other
Antitrust Laws required in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
and (ii) all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,
registrations, filings, approvals and authorizations from Governmental
Entities, including all steps as may be necessary to avoid an Action by any
Governmental Entity, including using reasonable best efforts in the contesting
and defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining
order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed.
Neither the Company and its Affiliates nor any of their respective Affiliates
shall be obligated to grant any consideration, or pay any fee or other similar
payment, to any third Person from whom consent or approval is required or
requested from or by such third Person in connection with the consummation of
the Transactions in order to obtain any such consent or approval. Parent shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, acquire or agree to
acquire by way of arrangement, amalgamation, merger or consolidation with, or
by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to
acquire any assets, if the entering into a definitive agreement relating to or
the consummation of such acquisition, arrangement, amalgamation, merger or
consolidation would reasonably be expected to (A) impose any delay in the
obtaining of, or significantly increase the risk of not obtaining, any
authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the Transactions or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period, (B) significantly increase
the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting
the consummation of the Transactions or (C) delay the consummation of the
Transactions.

(c) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided and
subject to the parties (and, to the extent applicable, their respective
Subsidiaries) obligations under applicable Law, none of the parties hereto
shall (and such parties shall cause, to the extent

 



69

    

 applicable, their respective Affiliates not to) knowingly take, or cause to
be taken, any action that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or
prevent the satisfaction by the Outside Date of any condition set forth in
_Article VIII_.

(d) Each of the parties agrees to instruct their respective counsel to
cooperate with the other and use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate
and expedite the identification and resolution of any issues arising under the
HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws at the earliest practicable dates. Such
commercially reasonable efforts and cooperation include counsels undertaking
(i) to promptly inform the other parties counsel of any substantive oral
communication with, and provide copies of written communications with, any
Governmental Entity regarding any such filings or applications or any such
transaction, and (ii) to confer with each other regarding appropriate contacts
with and response to personnel of such Governmental Entity. No party
shall independently participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with
any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, applications,
investigation or other inquiry without giving the other parties prior notice
of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental
Entity, the opportunity to attend and participate (which, at the request of
any of the parties, shall be limited to outside antitrust counsel only).

 

(e) A party shall not extend or consent to any extension of any applicable
waiting or review period or enter into any agreement with a Governmental
Entity to not consummate the Transactions, except upon the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

7.3 _Efforts to Close_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, and
without limiting the obligations set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, each
Parent Party and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied and to cause the Closing to occur as
soon as possible, including satisfying the conditions precedent set forth in
_Article VIII_ applicable to such party, and shall cooperate with the other
parties in executing any additional instruments reasonably requested by
another party (without cost or expense to the executing party) necessary to
carry out the Transactions and to fully carry out the purpose of this
Agreement, including executing such additional documents and providing such
information or documentation as may be requested by any party from whom any
consent or waiver in connection with the Transactions is requested. The "best
efforts" of the Company shall not require any Acquired Company, Security
Holder or any of their respective Affiliates to provide financing to the
Parent Parties or to compensate any Person, commence or participate in any
litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any
Person, in each case, for the consummation of the Transactions.

 

7.4 _Tax Matters_. __

 

(a) _Intended Tax Treatment_. The Security Holders, Seller Representative
and Parent intend that the Merger shall be treated for U.S. federal income
tax purposes in a manner consistent with Rev. Rul. 99-6, Situation 2, and that
such transaction shall be treated as a sale and exchange of the Class A Units
and Outstanding Class B Preferred Units under Section 741 of the Code with
respect to the Security Holders and that, with respect to SCOLP, the Company
shall be deemed to make a liquidating distribution of its assets to the
Security Holders and SCOLP shall be deemed to acquire the assets in exchange
for the Closing Merger Consideration. The

 



70

    

 Transactions shall further result in a termination of the Company pursuant
to Section 708(b)(1)(A) of the Code, causing the Companys taxable year to
close as of the Closing Date. The Security Holders and SCOLP further agree
that the principles of this _Section_ __ _ 7.4(a)_ shall apply to any
jurisdiction which requires or permits (whether by election or otherwise) the
purchase of the Class A Units and Outstanding Class B Preferred Units to be
treated as a sale and exchange under Section 741 of the Code with respect to
the Security Holders, and as a distribution of the Companys assets to the
Security Holders and the acquisition of such assets by SCOLP in exchange for
the Closing Merger Consideration. Each party shall file all Tax Returns
consistent with the intended treatment for Tax purposes under this _Section_
__ _ 7.4(a)_ and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith.

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. Transfer Taxes shall be paid 50% by Parent and 50%
by the Company (as a Transaction Expense, other than with respect to Delayed
Consent Properties, which Transfer Taxes shall be paid pursuant to the
applicable Delayed Consent Subsidiary Purchase Agreement), and Parent shall
properly file on a timely basis all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to any Transfer Taxes and provide to the other
party, upon request, evidence of such documentation.

 

(c) _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

 

(i) At its cost and expense, Seller Representative, with SCOLPs
cooperation, shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns of the
Acquired Companies relating to income Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period.
Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice
except to the extent otherwise required by Law. Seller Representative shall,
at least 30 days prior to the due date (with applicable extensions) for such
Tax Return(s), provide a copy of such Tax Return(s) to SCOLP. SCOLP shall,
within ten days after receiving such Tax Return(s), provide, in writing, any
comments to Seller Representative regarding any matters in such Tax Return(s)
with which it reasonably disagrees, and if SCOLP does not provide written
comments within ten days, SCOLP shall be deemed to have accepted such Tax
Return. In such case, Seller Representative and SCOLP shall reasonably
cooperate in good faith with each other to reach a timely and mutually
satisfactory solution to the disputed matters with respect to such
Tax Returns.

(ii) At its cost and expense, SCOLP shall prepare and timely file any Tax
Returns of the Acquired Companies for the Straddle Period and any other Tax
Return not referenced in _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)(i)_ relating to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
past practice except to the extent otherwise required by a change in Law.
SCOLP shall, at least 30 days prior to the due date (with applicable
extensions) for any income Straddle Period Tax Return(s), provide a copy of
such Tax Return(s) to Seller Representative. Seller Representative shall,
within ten days after receiving such income Straddle Period Tax Return(s),
provide, in writing, any comments to SCOLP regarding any matters in such Tax
Return(s) with which it reasonably disagrees, and if Seller Representative
does not provide written comments within ten days, Seller Representative shall
be deemed to have accepted such Tax Return. SCOLP shall also, at least fifteen
days prior to the due date (with applicable extensions) for all non-income
Tax Return(s), provide a copy of such Tax Return(s) to Seller Representative
and Sellers Representative shall provide, in writing, any comments to SCOLP
regarding any 

 



71

    

 matters in such non-income Tax Return(s) with which it reasonably disagrees,
and if Seller Representative does not provide written comments within
five days, Seller Representative shall be deemed to have accepted such Tax
Return. In both cases, Seller Representative and SCOLP shall reasonably
cooperate in good faith with each other to reach a timely and mutually
satisfactory solution to the disputed matters with respect to such Tax
Returns. SCOLP shall pay and discharge all Taxes shown to be due on such Tax
Returns. No later than ten Business Days prior to the due date of any income
Straddle Period Tax Return, or three Business Days prior to the due date of
any non-income Tax Return, as the case may be, Seller Representative shall pay
to SCOLP the portion of the Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return that is
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period for any non-income Tax Return
related solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or the pre-Closing portion of the
Straddle Period (as determined under _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)(iii)_), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds.

 

(iii) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)_, in the case of Taxes
that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such
Taxes that is attributable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing
Date shall be: (A) in the case of Taxes that are either (1) based upon or
related to income or receipts or (2) imposed in connection with any sale or
other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or
intangible), deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable
period of the Company (and each partnership in which the Company is a
partner) ended with (and included) the Closing Date; _provided_ that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending on and including the Closing Date and the period
beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each
period and (B) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis
with respect to the assets or capital of the Company, deemed to be the amount
of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes
determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately
preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on and including
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, any franchise Tax shall be allocated to the period during
which the income, operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such
Tax is measured, regardless of whether the right to do business for another
period is obtained by the payment of such franchise Tax.

(iv) Seller Representative and SCOLP shall reasonably cooperate, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing
all Tax Returns, including maintaining and making available to each other all
records necessary in connection with Taxes and in resolving all disputes and
audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes, in each case to
the extent related to any Acquired Company. The parties will need access,
from time to time, after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax
records and information with respect to the Acquired Companies to the extent
such records and information pertain to events occurring prior to the Closing
Date. SCOLP shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, and Seller
Representative shall, as applicable, (A) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to properly retain and maintain such records for a 

 



72

    

 period of seven years following the Closing Date, (B) give the other party
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying, or discarding any
such books and records and shall allow the other party to take possession of
such books and records, and (C) allow the other party and its agents and
representatives, at times and dates mutually acceptable to the parties, to
inspect and review such records as the other party may deem necessary or
appropriate from time to time, such activities to be conducted during normal
business hours. SCOLP and Seller Representative shall, upon request, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with
respect to the Transactions).

 

(v) In the case of any Tax Return described in _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)(i)_
or  _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)(ii)_, if the parties are unable to resolve any
dispute at least ten days before the due date (with applicable extensions) for
any income Tax Return, or at least five days before the due date (with
applicable extensions) for any non-income Tax Return, the dispute shall be
referred to the Accountants for resolution in accordance with the procedures
of _Section_ __ _ 2.15(c)_. If the Accountants are unable to resolve any
such dispute prior to the due date (with applicable extensions) for any such
Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by the relevant party,
subject to amendment, if necessary, to reflect the resolutions of the dispute
by the Accountants. The cost related to any such dispute shall be allocated in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.15(c)_.

 

(vi) None of SCOLP, the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates shall amend, re-file, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or
Tax election of any Acquired Company, in each case in respect of a Pre-Closing
Tax Period, or otherwise take any other action, that could adversely modify
the liability for Taxes for such Pre-Closing Tax Period, without the prior
written consent of Seller Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(vii) SCOLP and its Affiliates, on the one hand, or Seller
Representative on the other hand (the "Recipient") shall notify Seller
Representative or SCOLP, as the case may be, in writing within 30 days of
receipt by the Recipient of written notice of any Tax audit or Tax proceeding
which may affect the liability for Taxes of such other party under this
Agreement ("Tax Contest"). Seller Representative, at Seller Representatives
sole cost and expense, shall have the right to represent any Acquired
Companys interests in any Tax Contest relating to a Tax period ending on or
before the Closing Date. Seller Representative shall employ counsel of Seller
Representatives choice and at Seller Representatives expense; _provided_
that SCOLP shall be permitted, at SCOLPs expense, to be present at any such
Tax Contest, including the review of any correspondence and providing
reasonable comments to any documents related to such Tax Contest.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall not be entitled to settle,
either administratively or after the commencement of any Tax Contest without
the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). If Seller Representative declines such right to
represent and control such defense and settlement with respect to a Tax
Contest relating to a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, SCOLP,
at SCOLPs sole cost and expense, shall have the right to represent and
control such defense and settlement. SCOLP and its Affiliates shall have the
sole right

 



73

    

 to represent any Acquired Companys interests in any Tax Contest relating to
a Straddle Period. SCOLP shall employ counsel of SCOLPs choosing at SCOLPs
expense; _provided_  that, Seller Representative shall be permitted at Seller
Representatives expense to be present at any such Tax Contest, including the
review of any correspondence and providing reasonable comments to any
documents related to such Tax proceeding. The costs and expenses incurred by
SCOLP in defending any Tax Contest relating to a Straddle Period shall be
borne by Seller Representative and SCOLP in proportion to Seller
Representatives and SCOLPs respective liability for Taxes for such Straddle
Period, determined in the manner set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.15(c)_.

 

(viii) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)_, in the
case of any conflict between this _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)_ and any other
provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)_
shall control.

 

(d) _Cooperation_. Parent, the Security Holders, Seller Representative,
the Company and the Surviving Company shall cooperate, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any administrative or judicial proceedings with respect to Taxes
or other Tax matters. Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to,
the requirements under _Section_ __ _ 6.1_.

7.5 _Indemnification; _ _Directors_ _and_ _Officers_ _Insurance_.

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Closing Date, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, the individuals who on or prior to the Closing Date were
directors, managers, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of any
Acquired Company (each, a "Covered Party" and collectively, the "Covered
Parties"), with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities
as such or as trustees or fiduciaries of any plan for the benefit of the
Employees or taken at the request of any Acquired Company at any time on or
prior to the Closing Date. Parent agrees that all rights of the Covered
Parties to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as
provided in the respective Organizational Documents of each Acquired Company
as now in effect and any indemnification agreements or arrangements of any
Acquired Company with respect to Covered Parties shall survive the Closing
Date and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. Such rights shall not be amended or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights of the Covered Parties, unless such
modification is required by applicable Law, for a period of not less than six
years. In addition, Parent shall pay any and all legal and other fees, costs
and expenses (including the cost of investigation and preparation) of any
Covered Party under this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the
extent required by applicable Law. Parent shall also pay all fees, costs and
expenses, including legal fees that may be incurred by a Covered Party in
enforcing this  _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ or any Action involving a Covered Party
resulting from the Transactions.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Covered Party shall cooperate, and cause their
respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense of any Action relating to
any acts or omissions

 



74

    

 covered under this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ and shall provide access to
properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be
furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith.

 

(c) At or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase and pay in
full a "tail" prepaid insurance policy (the "DandO Insurance") with respect to
the Covered Partys existing directors and officers liability insurance
coverage that shall provide such directors and officers coverage for six years
following the Effective Time (including with respect to acts or omissions
occurring in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions on terms with
respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable to the Covered Parties
than those of such policies in effect on the date hereof). Parent and the
Company (as a Transaction Expense) shall each pay one-half of all costs and
expenses related to the DandO Insurance, including the total premium,
underwriting costs, brokerage commission for Parents or Companys broker,
Taxes related to such DandO Insurance and other fees and expenses of such
policy, as and when due.

 

(d) The obligations of Parent, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any Covered Party to whom this _Section_ __ _
7.5_ applies without the consent of the affected Covered Party (it being
expressly agreed that (i) the Covered Parties to whom this _Section_ __ _
7.5_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_
and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein and (ii) the
rights set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ are in addition to, and not in
substitution of, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
Covered Party may have).

 

(e) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) is not the continuing
or surviving entity following an arrangement, amalgamation, merger or
consolidation with any other Person or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_.

 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_,
the Acquired Companies shall not include any Delayed Consent Subsidiary
during the period from the Closing Date until the applicable Delayed Consent
Equity is transferred to the Surviving Company in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 2.13(d)_, and no individual who would otherwise be a Covered Party with
respect to such Delayed Consent Subsidiary shall be deemed to be a Covered
Party unless and until the applicable Delayed Consent Equity is transferred to
the Surviving Company in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.13(d)_.

7.6 [Intentionally omitted]

 

7.7 _Evidence of Title_.

 

(a) Parent has ordered commitments (collectively, the "Commitments" and,
individually, a "Commitment") for ALTA Form Owners Policies of Title
Insurance for each parcel of Real Property (collectively, the "Title
Policies") from the Title Company, along with copies of all instruments
described in Schedule B of each Commitment, in the amount of the

 



75

    

 Attributable Property Value (or such lesser amount selected by Parent) for
each such Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property. The parties will
cooperate reasonably and in good faith to satisfy the requirements and
conditions of the Title Company for the issuance of the Title Policies (which
may include such requirements and conditions being satisfied by causing the
Title Company to obtain an indemnity from the title company that issued the
existing owners title policy to the applicable Acquired Company in order to
insure over such matters), including (without limitation), the execution and
delivery by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company at Closing
of customary affidavits as may be required by the Title Company, in each
case, in the forms attached as exhibits hereto or otherwise agreed by Company
as of the date hereof; _provided, however_ , the foregoing shall not apply
to (i) requirements or conditions which are not applicable to the
Transactions (including, without limitation, payment of amounts to be
addressed as part of Net Working Capital), (ii) estoppel certificates, which
shall be governed by  _Section_ __ _ 7.7(b)_, or (iii) any requirements or
conditions for any endorsements or affirmative coverage requested by Parent
other than the affidavits described in _Section_ __ _ 2.11(a)(xvi)_.
Parent shall bear the cost of the Title Policies and the costs of any
endorsements to the Title Policies that are requested by Parent. For the
avoidance of doubt, it shall not be a condition to Closing that the Title
Company is prepared and committed to issue for each Real Property the Title
Policies.

(b) The Company shall request an estoppel certificate from (i) the lessors
under each Real Property Lease listed on _Section_ __ _ 7.7(b)(i)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedules, (ii) the lessees under the Material Tenant
Leases listed on  _Section_ __ _ 7.7(b)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, (iii) HSC South Fork LLC (with respect to the status of the
Operating Agreement of SHM South Fork JV LLC) and (iv) when requested by
Parent in writing, the counterparty to any material Permitted Lien, where
such counterparty is obligated to provide an estoppel certificate under the
terms of such Permitted Lien. The Company shall request such estoppel
certificates promptly after the date hereof, or, in the case of Permitted
Lien estoppels, promptly after requested by Parent, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, at no expense to the Company and in any event excluding
litigation, to obtain an estoppel certificate from HSC South Fork LLC and
from each such lessor, lessee and counterparty to a Permitted Lien as
described in the preceding sentence at or prior to the Closing to the extent
the applicable Real Property Lease, Material Tenant Lease or Permitted Lien,
as the case may be, obligates such lessor, lessee or party to a Permitted
Lien to deliver an estoppel certificate. The estoppel certificates shall be in
the form and content reasonably approved by the Company and Parent; _provided_
, that, to the extent an Acquired Company received an estoppel certificate
(including any estoppel language provided as part of a consent or other
instrument) from such lessor in connection with the acquisition of such Real
Property by the Acquired Company, an estoppel certificate (or estoppel
language) in substantially the same form as the estoppel certificate (or
estoppel language) provided to the Acquired Company at the time of such
acquisition shall be deemed approved by Parent.

 

7.8 _Exclusivity_. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that until the
earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement, the
Company shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries or any of its
controlled Affiliates to, and will instruct its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

 

(a) solicit, initiate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with any
Person, knowingly encourage the submission of any inquiries, proposals, or
offers by, or take any other

 



76

    

 action intended or designed to facilitate the efforts of any such Person,
other than Parent or its Affiliates, relating to:

 

(i) the possible acquisition of, or business combination with, any Acquired
Company (whether by way of merger, consolidation, take-over bid, purchase of
Equity Securities, purchase of assets or otherwise, directly or indirectly);
or

 

(ii) the possible acquisition of any Equity Securities of any Acquired
Company or all or a material portion of the assets of any Acquired Company
(other than any assets sold in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 5.1(c_), _(e)_
or _(u_ )).

 

(b) Upon receipt of any inquiry from any third party with respect to any
transaction of the type described in  _Sections 7.8(a)(i)_ and _7.8(a)(ii)_ ,
the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such inquiry.

 

7.9 _Notice of Certain Events_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of Closing or the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall promptly
notify Parent in writing of: any fact, circumstance, event or action the
existence, occurrence or taking of which (i) has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect, or (ii) has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in,
any failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ to be
satisfied. Parents receipt of information pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.9(a)_ shall not operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation,
warranty or agreement given or made by the Company in this Agreement and,
unless Parent otherwise agrees in writing, shall not be deemed to amend or
supplement the Company Disclosure Schedules.

(b) From the date hereof until the earlier of Closing or the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Parent shall promptly notify
the Company in writing of: any fact, circumstance, event or action the
existence, occurrence or taking of which (i) has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent to
consummate the Transactions, or (ii) has resulted in, or could reasonably be
expected to result in, any failure of any of the conditions set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ to be satisfied. The Companys receipt of information
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.9(b)_ shall not operate as a waiver or
otherwise affect any representation, warranty or agreement given or made by
Parent in this Agreement and, unless the Company otherwise agrees in writing,
shall not be deemed to amend or supplement the Parent Disclosure Schedules.

act in good faith or use reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing to
occur, as required by  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ and any other applicable
provisions of this Agreement.

8.4 _Waiver of Conditions_. All conditions set forth in this _Article
VIII_ will be deemed to have been satisfied or waived from and after the

8.5 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Transactions
may be abandoned, prior to the Closing solely:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 



79

    

(b) by Parent, if (i) any representation or warranty of the Company set
forth in _Article III_ shall not be true, correct and complete, or (ii) the
Company has failed to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of the
Company set forth in this Agreement (including an obligation to
consummate the Closing), in each case, such that the conditions to the
Closing set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ would not (in the absence of a
waiver) be satisfied as of the Closing Date and the breach or breaches causing
such representations or warranties not to be true, correct and complete, or
the failures to perform any covenant or agreement, as applicable, are not
cured within 20 Business Days after written notice thereof is delivered to the

so as to cause the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.2_
to not (in the absence of a waiver) be satisfied as of the Closing Date;

 

(c) by the Company, if (i) any representation or warranty of the Parent
Parties set forth in _Article IV_  shall not be true, correct and complete,

warranties not to be true, correct and complete, or the failure to perform
any covenant or agreement, as applicable, are not cured within 20 Business
Days after written notice thereof is delivered to the Parent Parties;
_provided_ that the Company is not then in breach of this Agreement so
as cause the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ not
to (in the absence of a waiver) be satisfied as of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _further_ , that neither a breach by Parent of  _Section_ __ _
6.5_ nor the failure to deliver the Closing Merger Consideration or the
payments contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.9_ at the Closing (or the date on
which the Closing would have occurred but for the breach of this Agreement by
any Parent Party) as required hereunder shall be subject to cure hereunder
unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Company;

 

(d) by Parent or the Company if (i) the Closing shall not have occurred on

Outside Date may be extended by such period as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree in writing, and _provided, further_ , that if either of Baxter
Underwood or Gavin McClintock dies or becomes disabled prior to the Closing
Date, Parent and the Company may mutually agree in writing to extend the
Outside Date for a period of up to three months, and (ii) the terminating
party has not materially breached any provision of this Agreement in a manner
that shall have proximately caused the failure to consummate the Transactions
on or before the Outside Date; _provided_ that if any party brings any Action

the terms and provisions hereof, the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ _1_ ; or

either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, the
provisions of this Agreement shall immediately

 



80

    

 become void and of no further force and effect (other than the last sentence
of _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, _Section_ __ _ 6.4_,  _Section_ __ _ 6.5_,
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_, this _Section_ __ _ 8.6_, _Section_ __ _ 10.1(d)_,
_Section_ __ _ 10.3_ and _Article XI_ , which shall survive the termination
of this Agreement (other than the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 11.11_, which
shall terminate)), and there shall be no liability on the part of the Parent
Parties, the Company, Sailor Newco, Seller Representative or the Security
Holders to one another; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing set forth in
this Agreement will relieve any party from liability for any Willful Breach.
No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

 

ARTICLE IX

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

 

9.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The
representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement and
all claims for indemnification with respect thereto shall survive the Closing
and terminate on the date that is the 15-month anniversary of the Closing
Date. The covenants and agreements of the parties set forth in this Agreement
and all claims for indemnification with respect thereto shall not survive the
Closing, except with respect to those covenants and agreements that, by their
terms, contemplate performance in whole or in part after the Closing, which
such covenants and agreements shall remain in full force and effect until
performed in accordance with their express terms or the applicable obligations
expire in accordance with their express terms (the date on which any such
representation, warranty or covenant ceases to survive, as applicable, the
"Survival Period Termination Date"). Any claim for indemnification not made by
the Person to be indemnified before the applicable Survival Period
Termination Date will be irrevocably and unconditionally released and waived.

 

9.2 _Indemnification by the Security Holders_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article IX_ , from and after
Closing, the Parent Parties and their respective directors, managers,
officers, employees, Affiliates, equityholders, agents, attorneys, other
Representatives, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Parent
Indemnified Parties") may assert, as their sole and exclusive remedy for any
breach of this Agreement, and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, claims against the amount of funds then remaining in the Retention
Escrow Account in respect of any Losses arising from:

 

(i) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by the
Company in this Agreement to be true and correct in all respects at and as of
the Closing Date or of any of the Delayed Consent Subsidiary Representations
to be true and correct in all respects with respect to the applicable Delayed
Consent Subsidiary at and as of the date of transfer of the Delayed Consent
Equity for such Delayed Consent Subsidiary in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.13(d)_, in each case, unless such representations or warranties relate to an
earlier date and are true and correct on and as of such earlier date; and

(ii) the breach of any covenant on the part of the Company prior to the
Closing (but only to the extent such breach occurred prior to the Closing
Date) or on the part of the Security Holders, Seller Representative or Sailor
Newco (whether such breach occurred prior to or after the Closing Date).

 



81

    

(b) No Parent Indemnified Party shall have any claim for any Loss to the
extent that such Loss could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if the
Parent Parties and their Affiliates had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate
any Loss upon becoming aware of the event that gave rise to the Loss.

 

9.3 _Indemnification by the Parent Parties_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article IX_ , the Parent Parties
hereby agree, from and after the Closing, to indemnify, jointly and
severally, and hold the Security Holders, Sailor Newco, Seller Representative
and their respective directors, managers, officers, employees, Affiliates,
equityholders, agents, attorneys, other Representatives, successors
and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties")
harmless from and against, and pay to the applicable Seller Indemnified
Parties the amount of, any Losses arising from:

 

(i) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by the
Parent Parties in this Agreement to be true and correct in all respects at
and as of the Closing Date, in each case, unless such representations or
warranties relate to an earlier date and are true and correct on and as of
such earlier date; and

 

(ii) the breach of any covenant on the part of any Parent Party (whether
such breach occurred prior to or after the Closing Date) or, following the
Closing, the Company.

(b) No Seller Indemnified Party shall have any claim for any Loss to the
extent that such Loss could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if the
Security Holders and their Affiliates had taken all reasonable steps to
mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of the event that gave rise to
the Loss.

9.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, in the event an indemnified party has
a claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party claim
(a "Direct Claim"), the indemnified party shall, promptly (and in any event
within five days) after becoming aware of such claim, deliver written notice
of such claim to the indemnifying party setting forth in reasonable detail
the specific claim, the basis therefor and the amount of the Loss, including
copies of all material written evidence thereof. Any failure of the
indemnified party to promptly provide notice as provided above shall not
relieve the indemnifying party of its indemnification obligations, except and
only to the extent that the indemnifying party forfeits rights or defenses or
is otherwise materially prejudiced by reason of such failure. The indemnified
party shall allow the indemnifying party and its professional advisors to
investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct
Claim and the amount of the Loss, and the indemnified party shall assist the
indemnifying partys investigation by giving such information and assistance
(including access to the applicable Acquired Companys premises and personnel
and the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the
indemnifying party or any of its professional advisors may reasonably
request.

 



82

    

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, in the event that any Action shall be
instituted or that any claim or demand shall be asserted by any third party in
respect of which payment may be sought under _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ or _Section_
__ _ 9.3_ (regardless of the limitations set forth in _Sections_ __ _ 9.5_
and _9.6_ ) (a "Third-Party Claim"), the indemnified party shall, promptly
(and in any event within five days) after receipt by such indemnified party of
notice of such Third-Party Claim, deliver written notice to the indemnifying
party setting forth in reasonable detail the specific claim, the basis
therefor and the amount of the Loss, including copies of all material written
evidence thereof. Thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver to the
indemnifying party, promptly (and in any event within five days) after the
indemnified partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the
Third-Party Claim. Any failure of the indemnified party to promptly provide
notice or deliver documents as provided above shall not relieve the
indemnifying party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to
the extent that the indemnifying party forfeits rights or defenses or is
otherwise materially prejudiced by reason of such failure.

 

(i) At its sole cost and expense, the indemnifying party shall have the
right to participate in the defense of a Third-Party Claim and, at its sole
option, control, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such
Third-Party Claim and be represented by counsel selected by the indemnifying
party. If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof but the indemnified party may participate, at his or its own expense,
in the defense of such Third-Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that such
indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party if (A) so
requested by the indemnifying party to participate or (B) in the reasonable
written opinion of counsel to the indemnified party, a conflict exists on a
material issue between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party that
would make such separate representation advisable; _provided, further,
however_ , that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for more
than one such counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any
Third-Party Claim. All the indemnified parties shall cooperate in the
defense, negotiation and settlement of any Third-Party Claim. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying partys request) the
provision to the indemnifying party of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and making employees available
(without charge) at such times and places as may be reasonably necessary to
defend against such Third-Party Claim for the purpose of providing
additional information, explanation or testimony in connection with such
Third-Party Claim. If the indemnifying party elects not to control, defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim that
relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, the indemnified party
shall defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third-
Party Claim.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ to the
contrary, the indemnified party shall not, without the prior written consent
of the indemnifying party, (A) admit any liability with respect to, or settle
or compromise any, Third-Party Claim or (B) permit a default or consent to
entry of any judgment. The indemnifying party may (1) settle or compromise
any Third-Party Claim or (2) permit a default or consent to entry of any
judgment (x) without the consent of the indemnified party if such settlement
or 

 



83

    

 resolution is solely for money damages not exceeding the Parent Cap or the
Seller Cap, as applicable, and the indemnified party is not required to admit
guilt or liability relating to such matter and (y) with the consent of the
indemnified party in all other cases, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(c) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Sections_ __ _ 9.5_ and _9.6_
, after any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time
in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or
the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at a
mutually binding agreement with respect to a claim hereunder, the indemnifying
party shall pay, or cause to be paid (if applicable) from the Retention Escrow
Account in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, to the
indemnified party any sums due and owing pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such matter. If the indemnifying party makes any payment on any
Third-Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the extent
of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the indemnified party to any
insurance benefits (other than under the RandW Policy) or other claims of the
indemnified party with respect to such Third-Party Claim.

 

(d) With respect to any notices, responses, consents, approvals or exercise
of rights (but for the avoidance of doubt, not obligations to pay money)
regarding claims by (i) a Parent Indemnified Party, reference in this
Agreement to an indemnifying party shall mean Seller Representative and (ii) a
Seller Indemnified Party, references in this Agreement to an indemnified
party shall include Seller Representative. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _
9.4_ shall affect the Parent Cap or the Seller Cap.

 

9.5 _Certain Limits on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) the Parent Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification for Losses under _Section_
__ _ 9.2(a)(i)_ unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses for which such
indemnifying party would, but for this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_, be liable
thereunder exceeds on an aggregate basis $8,893,750, and then only to the
extent of such excess; and (ii) in no event shall the aggregate amount of all
payments made by or on behalf of the Security Holders in connection with
indemnification claims and other obligations under this _Article IX_ (which
shall include all payments made from the Retention Escrow Account) exceed the
Retention Escrow Amount (the "Parent Cap").

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) the Seller Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification for Losses under _Section_
__ _ 9.3(a)(i)_ unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses for which such
indemnifying party would, but for this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_, be liable
thereunder exceeds on an aggregate basis $7,893,750, and then only to the
extent of such excess; and (ii) in no event shall the aggregate amount of all
payments made by or on behalf of the Parent Parties in connection with
indemnification claims and other obligations under this _Article IX_ exceed
on an aggregate basis the aggregate value of the SCOLP Units issued to
Electing Security Holders (the "Seller Cap").

 

(c) The limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_ and _Section_ __ _
9.5(b)_ shall not apply in respect of any claims for indemnification with
respect to Fraud; _provided_ , that in no event shall the Parent Indemnified
Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ for any amounts that, in the aggregate,
exceed the Base Purchase Price.

 



84

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Parent
Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be deemed not to
have suffered any Loss (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) to the extent
that such Loss (i) is accrued, provided or reserved for, or otherwise
reflected or taken into account in, the Financial Statements, or (ii) arises
from any item or matter that is included or otherwise taken into account in,
or was raised or should have been raised as part of the settlement of, Net
Working Capital or the other items of the Closing Statement.

(e) Any Loss under this Agreement shall be determined without duplication
of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Loss
constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement.

 

(f) With respect to the indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.2(a)_ _(i)_ , any payment to be made to the Parent Indemnified
Parties with respect to Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(i)_ (other
than claims for Fraud) shall be made as follows, in each case, subject to the
limitations contained in this  _Article IX_ :

(i) first, from the Retention Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of
the Retention Escrow Agreement; and

(ii) second, from the RandW Policy up to the policy limit (or such lesser
amount obtained under the RandW Policy in connection with a settlement and
release negotiated with the insurer of the RandW Policy).

 

(g) The Parent Parties acknowledge and agree that, except as expressly set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_ and _Section_ __ _
9.5(f)_, other than in the case of Fraud, the RandW Policy shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Parent Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses
with respect to the breach of any representation or warranty contained herein
or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement that are sustained
or incurred by any of the Parent Indemnified Parties and, except as expressly
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_ and in the
case of Fraud, the Security Holders shall have no liability to any Parent
Indemnified Party for any Losses with respect to breaches of any
representation or warranty hereunder pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(i)_ (
_provided_ , that, in the case of Fraud, any such Parent Indemnified Party
shall first seek recovery, if the Losses with respect to breaches of any
representation or warranty hereunder pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(i)_
are recoverable under the RandW Policy, under the RandW Policy).

 

(h) Solely for purposes of determining under this _Article IX_ whether
there is an indemnifiable Loss under  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(i)_ or _Section_
__ _ 9.3(a)(i)_, as applicable, including for purposes of determining the
amount of such Losses, all qualifications or exceptions therein referring to
the terms "material", "materiality", "in all material respects" or "Material
Adverse Effect," as well as the qualification of "to the Companys Knowledge"
in the lead-in to _Article III_ (but not the references to "Companys
Knowledge" in the specific representations and warranties in Article III),
shall be disregarded (except with respect to the term "Material Adverse
Effect" in _clause (ii)_ of _Section_ __ _ 3.7_, the term "materially delay"
in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_, the term "Material
Contracts" and the term "Material Tenant Leases"). For the avoidance of doubt,
such qualifications and exceptions shall not be disregarded for any purpose
other than as set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.5(h)_.

 



85

    

(i) Nothing in this _Article IX_ is intended to affect or limit the
ability of Parent to recover under the RandW Policy for any matters covered
thereunder.

9.6 _Calculation of Losses_.

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under
this _Article IX_  shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the
indemnified party under other sources of indemnification, insurance policies
or otherwise with respect to such Losses (net of any expenses incurred in
connection with such recovery). The Parent Parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies for any
Losses prior to seeking indemnification under this Agreement. If an
indemnified party recovers under an insurance policy (other than the
RandW Policy) or other source of indemnification with respect to any Loss that
an indemnified party has received an indemnity payment pursuant to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, then such indemnified party shall promptly
pay over to the indemnifying party the amount so recovered (but not in excess
of the amount received by the indemnified party pursuant to this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement,
no party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person for any Losses
that are not legally recoverable under applicable Law as actual breach of
contract damages of such other Person.

 

9.7 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Seller Representative (on
behalf of the Security Holders) and Parent agree to treat any indemnity
payment made pursuant to this _Article IX_ as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for federal, state, local and foreign income Tax purposes except as
otherwise required by Law after consultation with the other parties.

9.8 _Release of Escrow Funds_. Parent shall notify the Escrow Agent of any
claim for indemnification made by any Parent Indemnified Party. Promptly
following the final determination in accordance with this _Article IX_ of any
claim for indemnification made by any Parent Indemnified Party, upon request
by Parent, Seller Representative shall execute and deliver a certificate
requesting the Escrow Agent to deliver by wire transfer to an account
designated by Parent immediately available funds in the amount of such claim
as finally determined in accordance with this _Article IX_ (not to exceed the
amount of funds then remaining in the Retention Escrow Account). On the date
that is the 15-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Release Date"),
Parent and Seller Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent to deliver to Seller Representative (on behalf of the
Security Holders for distribution to each such Security Holder in accordance
with its Pro Rata Share), or upon request of Seller Representative, directly
to the Security Holders, the amount of funds then remaining in the Retention
Escrow Account by wire transfer to one or more accounts designated by Seller
Representative; _provided, however_ , that if prior to the Release Date
Parent notifies the Escrow Agent in writing that all or a portion of the funds
remaining in the Retention Escrow Account is subject to claims for
indemnification under this Agreement that have not been finally determined
(the "Outstanding Claims"), the amount delivered to Seller Representative
(or, the Security Holders, if applicable) upon the Release Date shall be equal
to the amount of funds then remaining 

 



86

    

 in the Retention Escrow Account, less the sum of any amounts subject to the
Outstanding Claims. If at any time after the Release Date the amount of funds
then remaining in the Retention Escrow Account exceeds the sum of any amounts
subject to the Outstanding Claims, Seller Representative and Parent shall
promptly execute and deliver a certificate requesting the Escrow Agent to
deliver such excess amount to Seller Representative (on behalf of the
Security Holders for distribution to each such Security Holder in accordance
with its Pro Rata Share) by wire transfer to one or more accounts designated
by Seller Representative.

 

9.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Closing, except with respect to
claims based on Fraud and claims against the RandW Policy, the sole and
exclusive remedy for any and all claims arising under, out of or related to
this Agreement and any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement
(including the Transactions and any representations and warranties set forth
herein, made in connection herewith or made as an inducement to enter into
this Agreement or any Ancillary Document) shall be the rights of post-Closing
adjustments to the Purchase Price set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.15_, indemnification set forth in this _Article IX_ (including the
Retention Escrow Account) and specific performance set forth in _Article XI_ ,
and no Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in
contract, tort or otherwise, or whether at law or in equity, and regardless
of the legal theory under which such entitlement, remedy or recourse may be
sought or imposed (including all rights afforded by any statute which limits
the effects of a release with respect to unknown claims), it being agreed
that all of such other remedies, entitlements and recourse are expressly
waived and released by the parties to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law. The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ and the limited
remedies provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.15_, this _Article IX_ , _Section_ __ _
11.11_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ were specifically bargained for among the
parties and were taken into account by the parties in arriving at the Base
Purchase Price and the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Seller
Representative (on behalf of the Security Holders) has specifically relied
upon the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ and the limited remedies
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.15_, this _Article IX_ , _Section_ __ _ 11.11_
and _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ in agreeing to the Base Purchase Price and the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

ARTICLE X

 

 _SELLER REPRESENTATIVE_

 

10.1 _Seller Representative_.

 

(a) _Appointment_. Sailor Newco is hereby authorized, appointed and
empowered to serve as the representative of each Security Holder with respect
to the matters contemplated by this Agreement and all Ancillary Documents with
respect to any Security Holder, with full power of substitution. Such
appointment is not as an agent but as a term of the Transactions and
accordingly such appointment is irrevocable by action of any Acquired Company
(prior to Closing) or any Security Holder. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document, Seller
Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of any Acquired
Company or any Security Holder in connection with the matters set forth in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Document.

 

(b) _Authority_. Seller Representative, in its capacity as such, shall
have the authority to act for and on behalf of each Acquired Company (prior
to Closing) and each Security Holder, including the full power and authority
on such Persons behalf, (i) to consummate the

 



87

    

 Transactions, (ii) to pay such Persons expenses incurred in connection with
the negotiation and performance of this Agreement (whether incurred before, on
or after the date hereof), (iii) to hold and distribute any funds with
respect to the Holdback Amount or payable by Parent hereunder which are for
the account of the Security Holders, (iv) to deduct or hold back any funds
which may be payable to any Security Holder pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement in order to pay any amount which may be payable by such Security
Holder or by Seller Representative on behalf of such Security Holder
hereunder, (v) to defend, resolve or settle any Action with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions and to negotiate, settle, compromise and
otherwise handle all disputes with the Parent Parties or any other Parent
Indemnified Party under this Agreement, including disputes regarding any
adjustment pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.14_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.15_ and
any indemnification claims made by any Parent Indemnified Party, (vi) to take
all other actions which may be taken by or on behalf of such Person in
connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary Document, (vii) to retain
funds for reasonably anticipated expenses and liabilities, (viii) to give and
receive notices on behalf of the Security Holders, including any notice of an
indemnification claim for which indemnification is sought by the Security
Holders pursuant to _Article IX_ and to provide notice and instructions to the
Escrow Agent and to authorize disbursement of funds from the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account and the Retention Escrow Account, as applicable, in
accordance with this Agreement, and (ix) to do each and every act and exercise
any and all rights of such Person, which such Person or Persons collectively
are permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement. Any notice
to Seller Representative, delivered in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _
11.1_, shall be deemed to be notice to any or all Acquired Companies (prior to
Closing) and Security Holders, as the case may be, for the purposes of this
Agreement.

(c) _Resignation of Seller Representative_. Subject to the appointment
and acceptance of a successor Seller Representative as provided below, Seller
Representative may resign at any time 30 days after giving notice thereof to
the Security Holders. Upon any such resignation, the Security Holders
may appoint a successor Seller Representative by a vote of the Persons who
were the holders of a majority of Outstanding Class A Units as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If no successor Seller Representative shall have
been appointed by the Security Holders and accepted such appointment within
20 days after the retiring Seller Representatives giving of notice of
resignation, then the resigning Seller Representative shall, on behalf of the
Security Holders, appoint a successor. Upon the acceptance of any appointment
as Seller Representative hereunder, such successor Seller Representative shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the resigning Seller Representative, and the resigning Seller
Representative shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.
After any resigning Seller Representatives resignation, as applicable,
hereunder as Seller Representative, the provisions of  _Sections_ __ _
10.1(d)_, _10.2_ and _ 10.3_ shall continue in effect for such resigning
Seller Representatives benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as Seller Representative.

(d) _Reimbursement_. Each Security Holder shall be liable severally, but
not jointly, based on its Pro Rata Share for the reimbursement of any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) paid or incurred by Seller Representative in connection with the
performance of his, her or its obligations as Seller Representative.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller
Representative shall utilize the Holdback Amount solely to satisfy
any reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses paid or incurred by Seller
Representative in connection with the performance of his, her or its 

 



88

    

 obligations as Seller Representative. To the extent the Holdback Amount is
insufficient to cover all such expenses, Seller Representative shall be
entitled to set off any reimbursement obligation owed under this _Section_ __
_ 10.1(d)_ by any Security Holder against any amounts such Security Holder is
entitled to receive under this Agreement.

 

10.2 _Exculpation_.

 

(a) The Acquired Companies and Security Holders acknowledge and agree that
Seller Representative has been engaged in its capacity as such solely as an
independent contractor and that Seller Representatives obligations are
contractual in nature only as expressly set forth in this Agreement (and
subject to all limitations contained herein). Accordingly, the Acquired
Companies and the Security Holders disclaim any intention to impose any duties
(including any fiduciary duty) by virtue of the engagement of Seller
Representative contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent that, at Law or
in equity, Seller Representative in its capacity as such has any duty
(including any fiduciary duty) to any Acquired Company or Security Holder, all
such duties are hereby eliminated, and each of the Acquired Companies and each
Security Holder hereby waives such duties (including any fiduciary duties),
to the fullest extent permitted by Law. Seller Representative shall not incur
any liability to any other Person in any way relating to or arising out of its
appointment hereunder, the performance of its duties hereunder or any of its
omissions or actions with respect thereto, including by virtue of the failure
or refusal of Seller Representative for any reason to consummate the
Transactions, in each case, except to the extent finally determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction (not subject to further appeal) to have
resulted directly and exclusively from Seller Representatives fraud or
willful misconduct.

 

(b) Seller Representative shall have no obligations to make any payments,
including on behalf of any Security Holder or any other Person, other the
distributions of the consideration for the Transactions actually received by
Seller Representative, if any, in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

10.3 _Indemnification_. Each Security Holder shall severally, but not
jointly, based on its Pro Rata Share, indemnify and hold harmless, Seller
Representative from any and all losses, liabilities and expenses (including
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) arising out of or in connection
with Seller Representatives execution and performance (solely in his
capacity as Seller Representative) of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents, except to the extent finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction (not subject to further appeal) to have resulted directly and
exclusively from Seller Representatives fraud or willful misconduct. This
indemnification will survive the termination of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Closing, as applicable, indefinitely. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller Representative shall be
entitled to set off any indemnification obligation owed under this _Section_
__ _ 10.3_ by any Security Holder against any amounts such Security Holder is
entitled to receive under this Agreement.

10.4 _Reliance by Parent_. Parent, SCOLP and their Affiliates shall be
entitled to rely upon any action taken and any agreements or amendments
entered into by Seller Representative in his, her or its capacity as such, and
shall have no liability or obligation to any Security Holder as a result of
any such reliance in good faith. Without limiting the foregoing, (a) the
delivery by Parent, SCOLP or their Affiliates to Seller Representative of any
amounts required to be delivered

 



89

    

 by any of them after Closing to any Security Holder pursuant to this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document properly in accordance with the terms
thereof shall discharge their obligations with respect to the delivery of
such amounts, and (b) none of them shall have any liability or obligation to
any Security Holder as a result of any failure by Seller Representative to
distribute such amounts to any Security Holder.

 

10.5 _Holdback Amount_. The Holdback Amount shall be held by Seller
Representative as a fund from which Seller Representative shall, in its sole
discretion, (a) reimburse itself for or pay directly any out-of-pocket fees,
expenses or costs it incurs in performing its duties and obligations under
this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, including out-of-pocket fees and
expenses incurred pursuant to the procedures and provisions set forth herein
and legal and consultant fees, expenses and costs for reviewing, analyzing and
defending any claim or process arising under or pursuant to this Agreement or
any Ancillary Document (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, as compensation
for the performance of its duties and obligations under this Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents) or (b) satisfy any other obligation or liability of
any Security Holder under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document as set
forth herein ( _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, Seller
Representative shall be entitled to do so in its sole discretion and shall
have no obligation to satisfy any other obligation or liability of any
Security Holder in priority to the items in  _clause_ __ _ (a)_ above or at
all). Each Security Holder acknowledges that Seller Representative will not be
liable for any loss of principal of the Holdback Amount except to the extent
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (not subject to
further appeal) to have resulted directly and exclusively from Seller
Representatives fraud or willful misconduct. At such time as Seller
Representative deems appropriate in its sole discretion,
Seller Representative shall pay to each Security Holder his, her or its Pro
Rata Share of all or any portion of the remaining Holdback Amount.

and any attempted assignment without the required consent shall be void;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may assign any of its rights or delegate

11.5 _Governing Law_.

 

(a) This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedules, the Parent Disclosure
Schedules, the Ancillary Documents, any Schedules hereto and the other
documents, instruments and agreements specifically referred to herein or
therein or delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, and all Related Claims, shall
be governed by the internal Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Laws rules or provisions (whether
of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably agrees (on behalf of themselves and any of their
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and Representatives) (i)
that any lawsuit, claim, complaint, controversy, formal investigation or
proceeding before or by any governmental entity, dispute of any kind or
nature (whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) or any other Action
involving a Financing Source that is in any way related to this Agreement or
the Transactions or the performance of services hereunder or related hereto,
including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letter, shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of the State of New York that would
result in the application of the Laws of any other State (other than to the
extent the Debt Commitment Letter expressly provides otherwise), (ii) that
service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed
to them at their respective addresses provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ shall
be effective service of process against them for any such Action and (iii)
that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law

 

11.6 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware, or, if no federal
court in the State of Delaware accepts jurisdiction, any state court within
the State of Delaware) over all Related Claims, and each party hereby
irrevocably agrees that all Related Claims may be heard and determined in such
courts. The parties hereby irrevocably and 

 



93

    

 unconditionally waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such Related Claim brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient
forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties agrees that a
judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the parties
hereby consents to process being served by any party in any Related Claim by
the delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section_
__ _ 11.1_ (other than by electronic mail) along with a notification that
service of process is being served in conformance with this _Section_ __ _
11.6_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to serve
process in any other manner permitted by Law. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY RELATED CLAIM IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY EXPRESSLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY RELATED
CLAIM BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST IT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY RELATED CLAIMS, THE DEBT FINANCING OR ANY OF
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties
hereto hereby agrees that it will not, nor permit any of its Affiliates to,
bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way
relating to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including, without limitation,
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or
the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, located in the Borough of Manhattan,
or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal
courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (and the appellate courts thereof), and that the provisions of _Section_
__ _ 11.6(a)_ relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim.

11.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (any of which may be delivered by facsimile or electronic
transmission), each of which shall constitute an original, and all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of a
fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic
transmission in .PDF format, by facsimile or other agreed format shall be
sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Minor variations in the form of the signature page, including footers from
earlier versions of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document, shall be
disregarded in determining the partys intent or the effectiveness of such
signature.

 

11.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Other than _Sections_ __ _ 6.3_,
_6.5_ , _7.5_ ,  _10.1_ , _11.1_ , _11.14_ and _ 11.15_, which are intended
to benefit and may also be enforced by the Covered Parties, Sidley, the
Nonparty Affiliates and other third parties contemplated thereby, as
applicable, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto (and their respective successors and
permitted assigns) any rights or remedies hereunder. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Financing Sources shall be intended third parties beneficiaries of
_Sections 11.5_ , _11.6_ , and _11.18_ and this sentence of this _Section_ __
_ 11.8_, and shall be entitled to enforce such provisions directly (and no
amendment or modification to such provisions in respect to the Financing
Sources may be made without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources
party to the Debt Commitment Letter).

11.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedules, the Parent Disclosure
Schedules, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, contain
the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter
contained herein and therein. This Agreement supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous agreements, arrangements, contracts, discussions,
negotiations, undertakings and understandings (including any letters of intent
or term sheets), whether written or oral, among the parties with respect to
such subject matter or any prior course of dealings. The parties have
voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations
respecting the Transactions exclusively in contract pursuant to the express
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, and the
parties expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or entitled to any
remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents. Furthermore, the parties each hereby acknowledge that this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents embody the justifiable expectations of
sophisticated parties derived from arms-length negotiations, and all
parties specifically acknowledge that no party has any special relationship
with another party that would justify any expectation beyond that of an
ordinary purchaser and an ordinary seller in an arms-length transaction. The
sole and exclusive remedies for any Related Claims shall be those remedies
available at Law or in equity for breach of contract only (as such contractual
remedies have been further limited or excluded pursuant to the express
terms of this Agreement); and the parties hereby agree that neither party
shall have any remedies or cause of action (whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise) of any statements, communications, disclosures, failures to
disclose, representations or warranties not set forth in this Agreement.

11.10 _Disclosure Schedules_. Except as otherwise provided in the Company
Disclosure Schedules or the Parent Disclosure Schedules, all capitalized terms
used but not defined therein shall have the meanings assigned to them in this
Agreement. Matters reflected in the Company Disclosure Schedules or the
Parent Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required
by this Agreement to be disclosed. No disclosure made in the Company
Disclosure Schedules or the Parent Disclosure Schedules shall constitute an
admission or determination that any fact or matter so disclosed is material,
and no Person shall use the fact of the inclusion of such facts or matters in
any dispute or controversy as to whether any obligation, amount, fact or
matter is or is not material. Information disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedules or the Parent Disclosure Schedules will qualify any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement to the extent that a
reasonable buyer would infer the relevance or applicability of
the information disclosed to any such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, notwithstanding the absence of a reference or cross-reference to
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on any such Company
Disclosure Schedules or Parent Disclosure Schedules or the absence of a
reference or cross-reference to such Company Disclosure Schedules or Parent
Disclosure Schedules in such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.
No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedules or the Parent Disclosure
Schedules relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement or Law
shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred.

11.11 _Remedies_.

 

(a) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any party
to perform any of its agreements and covenants hereunder will cause
irreparable injury to the other parties, for which damages, even if available,
will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the parties hereby acknowledge
and agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other
party of its covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the non-
breaching party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent or restrain such breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by
such other party, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent such breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such other party under this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereby agrees not to raise any objections to
the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of such parties under this Agreement. Each of the
parties hereby waives (i) any defenses in any Action for specific performance,
including the defense that a remedy at Law would be adequate and (ii) any
requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite
to obtaining equitable relief.

(b) To the extent any Parent Party brings any Action, claim, complaint or
other proceeding, in each case, before any Governmental Entity to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
prior to the Closing, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (i)
the amount of time during which such Action, claim, complaint or other
proceeding is pending, _plus_ 20 Business Days, or (ii) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such Action, claim, complaint or
other proceeding.

11.12 _Severability; Specific Versus General Provisions_. Whenever
possible, each provision of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any term or other provision of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long
as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, in
whole or in part, such term or provision is hereby deemed modified to give
effect to the original written intent of the parties to the greatest extent
consistent with being valid and enforceable under applicable Law. No party
shall assert, and each party shall cause its respective Affiliates or related
parties not to assert, that this Agreement or any part hereof is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to the
extent that a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company
or any Security Holder contained in this Agreement or the Company Disclosure
Schedules (each, a "Provision") addresses a particular issue with specificity
(a "Specific Provision"), and no breach by the Company or any Security Holder
exists under such Specific Provision, neither the Company nor any Security
Holder shall be deemed to be in breach of any other Provision (with respect to
such issue) that addresses such issue with less specificity than the Specific
Provision and if such Specific Provision is qualified or limited by the
Companys Knowledge, or in any other manner, no other Provision shall
supersede or limit such qualification in any manner.

11.13 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement, and any rule of construction or
interpretation otherwise requiring this Agreement to be construed or
interpreted against any party by virtue of the authorship of this Agreement
shall not apply to the construction and interpretation hereof. The parties
agree that any drafts of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document prior to the
final fully executed drafts shall not be used for purposes of interpreting any
provision thereof, and each of the parties agrees that no party or any
Affiliate thereof shall make any claim, assert any defense or otherwise take
any position inconsistent with the foregoing in connection with any Action
among any of the foregoing. For the purposes of this Agreement, except as
otherwise expressly provided herein or unless the context otherwise requires:
(a) the meaning assigned to each term defined herein shall be equally
applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of such term and
vice versa, and words denoting either gender shall include both genders as
the context requires; (b) where a word or phrase is defined herein, each of
its other grammatical forms shall have a corresponding meaning; (c) the
terms "hereof," "herein," "hereunder," "hereby" and "herewith" and words of
similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement;
(d) when a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section,
paragraph, Company Disclosure Schedule, Parent Disclosure Schedule, Exhibit or
Schedule, such reference is to an Article, Section, paragraph, Company
Disclosure Schedule, Parent Disclosure Schedule, Exhibit or Schedule to this
Agreement unless otherwise specified; (e) the word "include," "includes," and
"including" when used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "but not limited to," unless otherwise specified; (f) references to any
legislation or to any provision of any legislation shall include any amendment
thereto, and any modification or reenactment thereof, any legislative
provision substituted therefor and all regulations and statutory instruments
issued thereunder or pursuant thereto; (g) the word "or" shall be construed in
the inclusive sense of "or" unless otherwise specified; (h) the provision of
a table of contents, the division of this Agreement or Ancillary Documents
into articles, sections and other subdivisions and the insertion of headings
are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect or be utilized in
construing or interpreting this Agreement or Ancillary Document, as
applicable; and (i) all accounting terms used and not defined herein have the
respective meanings given to them under GAAP. Time is of the essence with
regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this
Agreement.

11.14 _Legal Representation_. The Parent Parties and the Company
acknowledge and agree that Sidley Austin LLP ("Sidley") has represented the
Company or any other of the Acquired Companies in connection with the
Transactions, and that the Security Holders, their Affiliates and their
respective partners, officers, directors, managers, employees and
Representatives (including Seller Representative) (the "Seller Group Members")
have a reasonable expectation that Sidley will represent them in connection
with any Action involving any Seller Group Member, on the one hand, and the
Parent Parties, the Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates
and Representatives (the "Parent Group Members"), on the other hand, arising
under this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the Transactions. Each of the
Company and the Parent Parties hereby, on behalf of themselves and the
Acquired Companies and the other Parent Group Members, irrevocably: (a)
acknowledge and agree that any attorney-client privilege, solicitor-client
privilege, work product or other attorney-client or solicitor-client
confidential information ("Attorney-Client Information") arising from
communications prior to the Effective Time between the Acquired Companies
(including any one or more officers, directors, managers, employees or
stockholders of the Acquired Companies), on the one hand, and Sidley, on the
other hand, are not

 



97

    

 included in the property, rights, privileges, powers, franchises and other
interests that are possessed by or vested in the Acquired Companies, that the
Acquired Companys rights to such Attorney-Client Information shall be deemed
property of, and controlled solely by, Seller Representative for the benefit
and on behalf of the Seller Group Members and, upon request, convey and
transfer any Attorney-Client Information to Seller Representative; (b)
acknowledge and agree that the Seller Group Members shall have the right to
retain, or cause Sidley to retain, any such documentation or information in
the possession of Sidley or such Seller Group Members at the Effective Time;
(c) agree not to access, retain or use any documentation or information
constituting Attorney-Client Information and that no Parent Group Member shall
have any right to waive any attorney-client privilege or other right to
confidentiality with respect to such Attorney-Client Information; (d)
disclaim the right to assert a waiver by any Seller Group Member with regard
to the attorney-client privilege, solicitor-client privilege or other right to
confidentiality with respect to such Attorney-Client Information solely due
to the fact that such documentation or information is physically in the
possession of the Surviving Company after the Effective Time; (e) consent to
Sidleys representation after the Effective Time of any Seller Group Member
in any Action that may relate to a Parent Group Member or the Transactions and
consent to and waive any conflict of interest arising therefrom without the
need for any future waiver or consent; and (f) consent to the disclosure by
Sidley to any Seller Group Member of any documentation or information obtained
by Sidley during the course of its representation of the Acquired Companies or
any Affiliate prior to the Effective Time, whether related to this Agreement,
the Ancillary Documents, the Transactions or otherwise, whether or not such
disclosure is made prior to or after the Effective Time and whether or not the
documentation or information disclosed is subject to any attorney-client
privilege, solicitor-client privilege or confidentiality obligation to the
Company, any Affiliate of the Company or any other Person. To the extent that
the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries have any rights to request or
control files of Sidley, only the Seller Group Members shall have such
rights. In the event that any Action arises after the Effective Time between
any Parent Group Member and a Person other than a Seller Group Member, such
Parent Group Member shall not disclose any documentation or information that
is subject to an attorney-client privilege or other rights of confidentiality
referenced in this _Section_ __ _ 11.14_ without the prior written consent of
Seller Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such Parent Group
Member is required by judicial order or other legal process to make such
disclosure, such Parent Group Member shall promptly notify Seller
Representative in writing of such requirement (without making disclosure) and
shall provide Seller Representative with such cooperation and assistance as
shall be necessary to enable Seller Representative to prevent disclosure by
reason of such attorney-client privilege, solicitor-client privilege or other
rights of confidentiality. This _Section_ __ _ 11.14_ is for the benefit of
Sidley and the Seller Group Members and such Persons are intended third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 11.14_.

 

11.15 _No Recourse Against Nonparty Affiliates_. All Related Claims may be
made only against (and are those solely of) the entities that are expressly
identified as parties in the preamble to this Agreement (the "Contracting
Parties"). No Person who is not a Contracting Party, including any current,
former or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, Representative or assignee
of, or any financial advisor or lender to, any Contracting Party, or any
current, former or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, Representative or
assignee of, or any financial advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing
(collectively, "Nonparty Affiliates"), shall have any liability; and, to the
maximum extent

 



98

    

 permitted by Law, each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such
liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such
Nonparty Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, (a) each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases any
and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be
available at Law or in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard
the entity form of a Contracting Party or otherwise impose liability of a
Contracting Party on any Nonparty Affiliate, whether granted by statute or
based on theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter
ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil,
unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise; and (b) each Contracting Party
disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the
performance of this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents.

 

11.16 _Rights Cumulative_. All rights and remedies of each of the parties
under this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents will be cumulative, and the
exercise of one or more rights or remedies will not preclude the exercise of
any other right or remedy available under this Agreement, the Ancillary
Documents or applicable Law.

 

11.17 _Prevailing Party_. In the event of any Action in connection with
this Agreement or any Ancillary Document, the prevailing party in any such
Action shall be entitled to recover from the other parties its costs and
expenses incurred in connection with investigating, preparing, prosecuting,
determining or settling such Action, including, without
limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses.

11.18 _Limitation on Liability; Waiver of Claims_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company (on
behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates and applicable Representatives)
hereby waives any rights or claims (including any theory or law or claim in
equity) against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, any
Ancillary Document, the Debt Commitment Letter or in respect of any other
document relating hereto or thereto (whether in tort, contract or otherwise)
or in respect of any oral or written representations made or alleged to be
made in connection herewith or therewith, and the Company (on behalf of itself
and any of its Affiliates and applicable Representatives) agrees not to
commence any action or proceeding against any Financing Source in connection
with this Agreement, any Ancillary Document, the Debt Commitment Letter or in
respect of any other document or theory of law or equity related hereto or
thereto and agrees to cause any such action or proceeding asserted (on behalf
of itself and any of its Affiliates and applicable Representatives) in
connection with this Agreement, any Ancillary Document, the Debt Commitment
Letter or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity related
hereto or thereto against any Financing Source to be dismissed or otherwise
terminated. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it
is acknowledged and agreed that no Financing Source shall have any liability
for any claims or damages to the Company in connection with this Agreement,
the Transactions, the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letter and the
transactions contemplated thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 11.18_ shall in any way limit or modify the rights and
obligations of Parent under this Agreement or any Financing Sources
obligations to Parent under the Debt Commitment Letter or to Parent (and,
following the Closing Date, any Acquired Company) under the definitive
agreements governing the Debt Financing.

_SECTION 1.1(b)_

 

 _ATTRIBUTABLE PROPERTY VALUE ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT_

 

The Attributable Property Value Adjustment Amount shall be calculated by the
Company in good faith as follows:

 



     | 1. |

One-Time Expenses: The Attributable Property Value Adjustment Amount shall be
increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of any consent fees,
administrative fees, processing fees, reimbursement amounts payable to
the landlord or representative of the landlord or similar one-time expenses
incurred and actually paid by the Company, Parent or one of their Affiliates
in connection with obtaining the Delayed Consent for the applicable Delayed
Consent Lease (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any (a) security
deposits, prepaid rent or similar payments in satisfaction of the Companys
obligations as a tenant, (b) transfer or other Taxes arising out of the
Transactions and (c) legal or other advisor fees incurred by the Company,
Parent or any Affiliate of Parent in connection with obtaining such Delayed
Consent). 

---|---|--- 
 



     | 2. |

Other Adjustments: The Attributable Property Value Adjustment Amount shall be
further increased by an amount calculated by the Company in good faith
applying the cap rate and Purchase Price Methodologies, as indicated in the
Purchase Price Allocation schedule, to the Net Operating Income used to
establish the Base Purchase Price (the "Reference NOI"), adjusted on a pro
forma basis for any net anticipated negative impacts to the Reference NOI
attributable to the applicable Delayed Consent Property when taking into
account any actual or anticipated positive or negative changes to the
Reference NOI, including as a result of adjustments required to be made to the
corresponding Delayed Consent Lease ( _e.g._ , increased rent for an extended
term or change in use reducing the total number of slips or storage spaces at
the property), if any, in order to obtain the applicable Delayed Consent. Such
increase shall be by reference to the cap rate applied by the parties to the
Agreement in agreeing to the Base Purchase Price. 

---|---|--- 
 

For purposes of calculating the Attributable Property Value Adjustment Amount,
"Net Operating Income" shall mean, for any period, with respect to any
property, the sum of the following (without duplication and determined on a
consistent basis with prior periods, including on a consistent basis with the
Financial Statements): (a) rents and other revenues received or earned in the
ordinary course of business (including, without limitation, revenue received
or earned in respect of service and repair of marine vessels, cabin and boat
rentals, brokerage and referral fees, commercial lease income, retail sales,
fuel sales, restaurant sales, and other property related use fees or income)
from or in connection with such property (including proceeds of rent loss (but
not in excess of the rent otherwise payable) or business interruption
insurance but excluding pre-paid rents and revenues and security deposits
except to the extent applied in satisfaction of tenants obligations for rent)
_minus_ (b) all expenses paid (excluding interest expense, income taxes,
depreciation and amortization (for the avoidance of doubt including any
capital expenditures), audit costs, software and technology costs, non-cash
expenses and other corporate-level marketing, legal and professional fees,
but including an appropriate accrual for expenses related to the ownership,
operation or maintenance of such property during the relevant period
(including but not limited to property taxes, assessments and the
like, insurance, utilities, payroll costs, maintenance, repair and

   

 landscaping expenses, local marketing expenses, and general and other
property-level administrative expenses (including property-level legal,
accounting, advertising, marketing and other expenses incurred in connection
with such property, but specifically excluding general corporate-level
overhead expenses of the Acquired Companies, non-recurring or extraordinary
income and expenses, and any property management fees))).

The Companys calculation of the Attributable Property Value Adjustment Amount
shall be subject to Seller Representatives right of review and the dispute
resolution procedures set forth in Section 2.14 of the Agreement.

   

_SECTION 1.1(d)_

 

 _DEBT REPAYMENT AMOUNT_

An amount in cash, if necessary, sufficient to reduce the Loans (as defined
in the Credit Agreement) such that after giving effect to the Delayed Consent
Properties Disposition (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and such
repayment, on a pro forma basis (i) the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (each
as defined in the Credit Agreement) (other than any Delayed Consent Credit
Parties (as defined in the Credit Agreement)) shall be in compliance with each
of the financial covenants set forth in Section 8.8 of the Credit Agreement;
(ii) Availability will be greater than $25,000,000 and (iii) the Minimum
Qualified Asset Condition and the Minimum Borrowing Base Asset Value Condition
Assets (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall be satisfied. The Debt
Repayment Amount will be calculated following delivery of the Delayed Consent
Schedule (including any updates to the Delayed Consent Schedule in accordance
with Section 2.13(a) of the Agreement) and will be set forth in the Estimated
Closing Statement delivered by the Company prior to the Closing.
