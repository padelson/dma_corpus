and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving

10 _Section 2.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws__. __At the Effective
Time, the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws of Merger Sub shall

Article 3.

_Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates_



 

 _Section 3.1 _Conversion of Securities__. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or
the holders of any of the following securities (except as specifically
provided herein with respect to elections made by such holders):



_(a) Conversion Generally._ Each common share, par value $0.001 per share, of
the Company ("Company Common Shares") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any Company Common Shares to be
canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(b) and Dissenting Shares referred to in
Section 3.5) shall be converted, subject to other provisions of this Section
3.1 and Section 3.2(e), into the right to receive (i) 0.3879 (the "Exchange
Ratio") of a share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share (together with
the associated one-half of a Parent Right, "Parent Common Stock"), of Parent
(the "Per Share Stock Consideration"), and (ii) $22.00 in cash without
interest (the "Per Share Cash Consideration" and, together with the Per Share
Stock Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all
such Company Common Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to other provisions of
this Section 3.1, Section 3.2(e) and Section 3.5 below. No fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be issued, and in lieu thereof, a cash payment
shall be made pursuant to Section 3.2(e) hereof. 



(b) Cancellation of Certain Shares. Each Company Common Share held by Parent,
Merger Sub, any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, or by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto.



(c) Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain issued, outstanding and unchanged as a validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.



(d) Change in Shares. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Shares
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different
class, by reason of any stock



 

11 dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, the Exchange Ratio, the Per Share Cash Consideration
and any number or amount contained herein which is based on the price of
Parent Common Stock or Company Common Shares or the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Shares, as the case may be, shall be
correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares.



_Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_._



(a) _Exchange Procedures_.



(i) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of Company Common Shares (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) a letter of transmittal and
instructions for use in effecting surrender by such holder of certificates
representing such holders Company Common Shares ("Old Certificates") to the
Exchange Agent in exchange for the consideration provided in this Article 3.



(ii) The holder of each Old Certificate, upon the surrender by such holder to
the Exchange Agent of such Old Certificate, together with the letter of
transmittal duly executed by such holder, shall be entitled to receive in
exchange for such Old Certificate the Merger Consideration into which the
Company Common Shares theretofore represented by such Old Certificate have
been converted pursuant to Section 3.1 (together with any applicable cash in
lieu of fractional shares and dividends or distributions in respect of such
Merger Consideration), and such Old Certificate shall forthwith thereafter be
canceled. Until such time as a certificate representing Parent Common Stock
(the "New Certificate") is issued to or at the direction of a holder of an
Old Certificate entitled to receive Per Share Stock Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.1, such Parent Common Stock shall be deemed not outstanding, and
such Parent Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any matter. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares that is not
registered on the transfer records of the Company, a New Certificate
representing the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock and the
cash consideration payable hereunder with respect to such Company Common
Shares may be issued and paid to a person other than the person in whose name
the Old Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Old Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a
person other than the registered holder of such Old Certificate or shall
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon exchange as
contemplated in this Section 3.2, the Merger Consideration into which the
Company Common Shares formerly represented by such Old Certificate are
converted in the Merger. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of any Old Certificate.



_(b) Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent
and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the
benefit of the holders of Company Common Shares, for exchange in accordance
with this Article 3, through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the
shares of Parent Common Stock and an amount of cash sufficient to deliver to
the holders of Company Common Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) the
aggregate Merger



 

12 Consideration (such certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock and cash,
together with cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or
distributions with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock with a record
date occurring after the Effective Time, being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund") deliverable pursuant to Section 3.1 in exchange for
outstanding Company Common Shares. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be
issued pursuant to Section 3.1 out of the Exchange Fund. Except as
contemplated by Section 3.2(e) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with the Exchange Agent, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, setting forth the procedures to be used for such exchange and the
other actions contemplated by this Section 3.2.



_(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock_.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no
cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 3.2(e), unless and until the holder of such Old
Certificate shall surrender such Old Certificate. Subject to the effect of
escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Old
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
in addition to the Merger Consideration deliverable therefore pursuant to
Section 3.1, without interest, (A) promptly, the amount of any cash payable
with respect to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(e) and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (B) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment
date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock.



_(d) Further Rights in Company Common Shares_. All Merger Consideration issued
and paid upon conversion of the Company Common Shares in accordance with the
terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.2(e)) shall be
deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Common Shares.



_(e) Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Old Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any
rights of a stockholder of Parent. __



(i) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall determine the difference between (A) the number of full shares
of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to
Section 3.2(b) and (B) the aggregate number of full shares of Parent Common
Stock to be distributed to holders of Company Common Shares pursuant to
Section 3.1(a) (such difference being the "Excess Shares"). As soon after the
Effective Time as practicable, the Exchange Agent, as agent for such holders
of Parent Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices
on the NYSE, all in the manner provided in this Section 3.2(e).



 

13 (ii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on
the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until
the net proceeds of any such sale or sales have been distributed to such
holders of Company Common Shares, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds
in trust for such holders of Company Common Shares as part of the Exchange
Fund. All commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction
costs of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale or sales of
Excess Shares shall be deducted from the Exchange Fund. In addition, the
Exchange Agents compensation and expenses in connection with such sale or
sales shall be deducted from the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall
determine the portion of such net proceeds to which each holder of Company
Common Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the
aggregate net proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of
the fractional share interest to which such holder of Company Common Shares is
entitled (after taking into account all shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued to such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all holders of Company Common Shares are
entitled.



(iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Shares with respect to
any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such
amounts to such holders of Company Common Shares subject to and in accordance
with the terms of Section 3.2(b).



_(f) Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares for six (6)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
any holders of Company Common Shares who have not theretofore complied with
this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(e) and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled
pursuant to Section 3.2(b), in each case, without any interest thereon.



_(g) No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Shares for any
such shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



_(h) Lost Certificates_. If any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required
by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(e) and any
dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 3.2(b), in each case, without any interest thereon.



 

14 _(i) Withholding_. Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Shares such amounts as Parent,
Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, with respect to
the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Company Common Shares in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent.



_Section 3.3 _Share Transfer Books__. At the Effective Time, the share
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be
no further registration of transfers of Company Common Shares theretofore
outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of certificates representing Company Common Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Company Common Shares except as otherwise provided herein or
by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Old Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(e) and any
dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 3.2(b).



_Section 3.4 _Company Stock Options__. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
outstanding unexercised and unexpired option to purchase Company Common
Shares, whether or not then vested or exercisable, issued under a Company
Stock Option Plan or otherwise (each, a "Company Option" and collectively, the
"Company Options"), or any other Person, except as expressly provided herein:



_(a)_ each Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than the sum of (i) the
Per Share Cash Consideration and (ii) the Closing Price of the Parent Common
Stock multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (such sum, the "Merger
Consideration Value")) shall be canceled and the holder thereof shall have no
right to receive any consideration therefor; and



_(b)_ each Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
with an exercise price per share less than the Merger Consideration Value
shall be canceled in exchange for the right to receive a payment in cash,
without interest, and Parent Common Stock equal in the aggregate to the
product (such product, the "Aggregate Spread Value") of (i) the excess of (A)
the Merger Consideration Value over (B) the exercise price per share under
such Company Option, and (ii) the number of Company Common Shares into which
such Company Option is exercisable. The Aggregate Spread Value of each Common
Option shall be paid as follows: (i) in an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the Aggregate Spread Value multiplied by the Cash Consideration
Percentage, reduced by the applicable withholding taxes on the Aggregate
Spread Value, and (ii) in a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
(A) the Aggregate Spread Value multiplied by Stock Consideration Percentage,
divided by (B) the Closing Price of the Parent Common Stock. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event more
than twenty (20) business days thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall
mail to each holder of a Company Option the applicable cash payment and



 

15 certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock. The term "Cash Consideration
Percentage" shall mean the percentage obtained by dividing the Per Share Cash
Consideration by the Merger Consideration Value. The term "Stock Consideration
Percentage" shall mean the percentage obtained by dividing (i) the Closing
Price of the Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, by (ii)
the Merger Consideration Value.



_(c)_ The Company represents and warrants to Parent that no consent or
approval of any of the holders of Company Options is required in order to
implement the provisions of this Section 3.4. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company Board shall take all necessary action to cause all outstanding
unvested Company Options to become fully vested and exercisable immediately
prior to the consummation of the Merger.



_Section 3.5 _Dissenting Stockholders__. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Company Common Shares that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder thereof who
properly exercises and perfects appraisal rights for such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") will be paid for by the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; provided,
however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL,
the right of such holder to such appraisal of its Company Common Shares shall
cease and such Company Common Shares shall be deemed converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
in this Article 3. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other related instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL and received by the Company and (b) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisals under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
(i) voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal
for Dissenting Shares, (ii) offer to settle, or settle, any such demands,
(iii) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal in
accordance with the DGCL, or (iv) agree to do any of the foregoing.



_Section 3.6 _Tax Adjustment__. In the event that either party, after
consulting with outside counsel, reasonably determines at any time that there
is a reasonable likelihood that the Merger would not qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, then such
party shall have the right to elect that the structure of the Merger shall be
revised as follows: (i) Parent shall form a new Delaware corporation which is
a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Alternative Holdco"), (ii)
Parent shall cause Alternative Holdco to form a new Delaware corporation which
is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Alternative Holdco ("Alternative Merger
Sub 1") and another new Delaware corporation which is a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Alternative Holdco ("Alternative Merger Sub 2"), (iii) at the
Effective Time, Alternative Merger Sub 1 shall be merged with and into the
Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation
("Alternative Merger 1") and Alternative Merger Sub 2 shall be merged with and
into Parent, with Parent continuing as the surviving corporation and each
share of Alternative Holdco stock held by Parent shall be cancelled
("Alternative Merger 2," and with Alternative Merger 1, the "Alternative
Mergers"), provided that (i) in no event will such revision to the structure
of the Merger result in any change in the amount of cash consideration to
which the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options would otherwise
be entitled to receive under this Agreement, and (ii) the percentage ownership
of the



 

16 Companys stockholders and option holders in Alternative Holdco shall be the
same as it would have been in Parent immediately after the Effective Time
under this Agreement (and Alternative Holdco shall have the same capital
structure (subject to immaterial exceptions) as Parent would have had
immediately after the Effective Time under this Agreement). In the event that
either party exercises this option to revise the structure of the Merger (an
"Alternative Structure Event"), (i) all references to the term "Parent Common
Stock" when used in the context of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger shall be deemed to be references to common stock to be issued by
Alternative Holdco in Alternative Merger 1, (ii) all references to the Share
Issuance shall be deemed to be references to Alternative Merger 2; (iii)
this Agreement shall be deemed automatically amended by the parties as
appropriate to give effect to the structure of the Alternative Mergers,
including, but not limited to, the amendment of Sections 7.2(c) and 7.3(c) to
provide that Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall have received the
opinion of its outside counsel, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that on
the basis of the facts, representations and assumptions set forth in
representation letters of Parent, Alternative Holdco, Alternative Merger Sub
1, Alternative Merger Sub 2 and the Company (or in such opinion), the
Alternative Mergers, taken together, will constitute a transaction described
in Section 351 of the Code and (iii) each party shall execute a
written amendment to this Agreement as necessary to reflect the foregoing and
to otherwise effect the substance of the transaction as set forth in the
Merger Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith
with one another and use its best efforts, to take or cause to be taken all
actions, and to do or cause to be done, all things necessary, including
amending this Agreement, to provide a mechanism to exchange Parent Company
Stock and to ensure that, if an Alternative Structure Event were to occur,
the Alternative Mergers could be consummated as closely as reasonably
practicable to the time the Merger would have been consummated but for the
Alternative Structure Event. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Section 3.6 the changes described in this Section 3.6 shall
not be implemented in a manner that would be materially adverse to the
interests of the holders of Parent Common Stock or the holders of Company
Common Stock.



Article 4.

_Company Representations and Warranties_



Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Schedule"), which, subject to Section 9.10, identifies exceptions
by specific Section references, the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent as follows:



_Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_._



_(a)_ The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted. __



_(b)_ Each subsidiary of the Company (each a "Company Subsidiary" and,
collectively, the "Company Subsidiaries") has been duly organized, and is
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation or organization, as the case may be. Each
Company Subsidiary has the requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted.



 

17 _(c)_ Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or
licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where
the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature
of its business makes such qualification, licensing or good standing
necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. __



_(d)_ Section 4.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all of the Company Subsidiaries. None of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary holds an Equity Interest in any other person except for
passive investments in the Equity Interests (not to exceed 2% of any such
companys outstanding Equity Interests) of public companies as part of the
cash management program of the Company _._



_Section 4.2 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws; Corporate Books and
Records__. The copy of the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation
(the "Company Certificate of Incorporation") attached to Section 4.2(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and the copy of the Companys By-laws (the
"Company By-laws") attached to Section 4.2(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule are true and complete copies thereof as in effect on the date hereof.
The Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of the Company
Certificate of Incorporation or the Company By-laws. True and complete copies
of (i) all approved minutes of meetings of the Company Board, or any

July 26, 2004, (A) 25,157,814 Company Common Shares were issued and
outstanding, all of which were validly issued and fully paid, nonassessable
and free of preemptive rights (which are binding upon the Company or any
Company Subsidiary), and (B) 3,397,536 Company Common Shares were issuable
(and such number was reserved for issuance) upon exercise of Company
Options outstanding as of such date. As of the date hereof, no Company
Preferred Shares are issued or outstanding. Except for Company Options and the
stock option agreements related thereto and except for arrangements and
agreements set forth in Section 4.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there
are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any character to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
a party or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound relating
to the issued or unissued Equity Interests of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such Equity
Interests, or obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue or
sell any of its capital shares or other Equity Interests, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such capital shares of, or other Equity
Interests in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary. As of July 26, 2004, the
weighted average exercise price of all outstanding Company Options equals
$20.863.



_(b) _ The Company has previously made available to Parent a true and
complete list, as of the date hereof, of the prices at which outstanding
Company Options as of the date



 

18 hereof may be exercised under any applicable Company Stock Option Plan, the
number of Company Options outstanding at each such price and the vesting
schedule of the Company Options for each officer of the Company. All of the
Company Common Shares subject to issuance under the Company Stock Option
Plans, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments
pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights (which are binding
upon the Company or any Company Subsidiary). There are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (A)
restricting the transfer of, (B) affecting the voting rights of, (C) requiring
the repurchase, redemption or disposition of, or containing any right of first
refusal with respect to, (D) requiring the registration for sale of, or (E)
granting any preemptive or antidilutive right with respect to, any Company
Common Shares or any other Equity Interests in, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. Each outstanding capital share of each Company Subsidiary is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights (other than any pre-emptive rights under applicable Law) and is owned,
beneficially and of record, by the Company or another Company Subsidiary or a
nominee of the Company or of another Company Subsidiary free and clear of all
Liens, options, rights of first refusal, agreements, limitations on the
Companys or such other Company Subsidiarys voting rights, charges and other
encumbrances of any nature whatsoever. There are no outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to provide funds to, or
make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise)
in, any Company Subsidiary or any other person, other than guarantees by the
Company of any indebtedness or other obligations of any wholly owned Company
Subsidiary as set forth in Section 4.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.



_Section 4.4 _Authority__.



_(a)_ The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company and, other than, with respect to the
Merger, as provided in Section 4.20, the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, as required by the DGCL and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company and no stockholder votes are necessary
to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has
approved this Agreement, declared advisable the transactions contemplated
hereby and has directed that this Agreement and the Merger be submitted to the
Companys stockholders for approval at a meeting of such stockholders. This
Agreement has been duly authorized (other than with respect to the Merger)
and validly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms subject only to the effect, if any, of (i)
applicable bankruptcy and other similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally, and (ii) rules of law governing specific performance,
injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.



_(b)_ The Company has taken all appropriate actions so that the restrictions
on business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL will not apply
with respect to or as a result of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, or the



 

19 Voting Agreements without any further action on the part of the stockholders
or the Company Board. No other state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is applicable to or purports to be applicable to the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



_Section 4.5 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents__.



_(a)_ The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not,
and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, (A) conflict
with or violate any provision of the Company Certificate of Incorporation or
Company By-laws or any equivalent organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary, provided that the Merger is not consummated prior to obtaining
the stockholder approval set forth in Section 4.20, (B) assuming that all
consents, approvals, authorizations and permits described in Section 4.5(b)
have been obtained and all filings and notifications described in Section
4.5(b) have been made and any waiting periods thereunder have terminated or
expired, conflict with or violate in any material respects any Law applicable
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any material property or
asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected or (C)
require any consent or approval under, result in any breach of or any loss of
any benefit under, constitute a change of control or default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)
under or give to others any right of termination, vesting, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a material Lien
on any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant
to, any material promissory note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement, lease, license, Company Permit or other instrument or obligation,
except, with respect to clause (C) for any such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, (x) reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (y) have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



_(b)_ The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not,
and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require the
Company to obtain any material consent, approval, authorization or permit of,
or make any material filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity
or any other person, except under the Exchange Act, Securities Act, any
applicable Blue Sky Laws, the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, the HSR Act,
foreign or supranational antitrust and competition Laws and the filing and
recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL.



_Section 4.6 _Permits; Compliance With Law__. Each of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary is in possession of all authorizations, licenses, permits,
certificates, registrations, approvals and clearances of any Governmental
Entity, and has made all filings, applications and registrations with any
Governmental Entity (including any authorizations required under the Federal
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended (the "FDCA") and
any regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA")
promulgated thereunder) necessary for the Company and each Company Subsidiary
to own, lease and/or operate its properties or other assets, or to carry on
its respective businesses substantially in the manner described in the
Company SEC Filings filed prior to the date hereof and substantially as it is
being conducted as of the date hereof, including, but not limited to, the
testing, manufacturing, storing, packaging, labeling and distributing of any
product of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the "Company Permits"), and
all such Company Permits are valid, and in full force and effect,



 

20 except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, or
failure to be valid or in full force and effect of, any of the Company
Permits, or the failure to have made such filings, applications and/or
registrations, would not, individually or in the aggregate, (x) reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y) have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in
conflict with, or in default or violation of, (A) in any material respect, any
Law applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any
material property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound
or affected or (B) any Company Permits, except, with respect to clause (B) for
any such conflicts, defaults or violations that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (y) have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has, within the last three years, received any
written or, to the knowledge of the Company, oral warning, notice, notice of
violation or probable violation, notice of revocation, or other
communication from or on behalf of any Governmental Entity, alleging (A) any
violation of any Company Permit, or (B) that the Company or any Company
Subsidiary requires any Company Permit for its business as currently conducted
that is not currently held by it, except for any such communications received
after the date hereof and promptly disclosed to Parent, none of which could,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No
investigation or inquiry by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is pending, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, with respect to any alleged or claimed violation of Law
applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any
material property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound
or affected, except for any such investigation or inquiry commenced after the
date hereof and promptly disclosed to Parent, none of which could,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



_Section 4.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements__.



_(a)_ The Company has timely filed or furnished all registration statements,
prospectuses, forms, reports, definitive proxy statements, schedules and
documents required to be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since June 30, 2001 (collectively, the
"Company SEC Filings"). Each Company SEC Filing (A) as of its date, complied
in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (B) did not at the time it was filed
(or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement
then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of
this Agreement, no Company Subsidiary is subject to the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act.



_(b)_ Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Filings (the "Company
Financial Statements") was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited quarterly
financial statements, as permitted on Form 10-Q, 8-K or any successor form
under the Exchange Act) on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and each presented fairly
in all material respects the consolidated financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of the Company



 

21 and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof
and for the respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end adjustments which were not and would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material).
The books and records of the Company and each Company Subsidiary have been,
and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with
applicable legal and accounting requirements, and the Company Financial
Statements are consistent with such books and records.



_(c)_ The Company has in place the "disclosure controls and procedures" (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) required in
order for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the
Company to engage in the review and evaluation process mandated by Section 302
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOXA"). The Companys "disclosure
controls and procedures" are reasonably designed to ensure that material
information (both financial and non-financial) relating to the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company
required by Section 302 of SOXA with respect to such reports. Except as
reflected in the Company Financial Statements, neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary is a party to any material off-balance sheet
arrangements (as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the
Exchange Act). To the Companys knowledge, KPMG LLP, which has expressed its
opinion with respect to the financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries included in Company SEC Filings (including the related notes), is
"independent" with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries within
the meaning of Regulation S-X since July 1, 2001. The Company has made such
disclosure of non-audit services performed by KPMG LLP in its proxy statements
with respect to its annual meetings of stockholders as is required under the
rules and regulations of the SEC.

 



_(d)_ Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries as of December 31,
2003 included in the Company Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2003, including the notes thereto, none of the Company or any
consolidated Company Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent, determined, determinable or
otherwise), other than (i) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2003 that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, (x) reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y) have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.



_(e)_ The Company has previously provided to Parent a true and complete copy
of any amendment or modification which has not yet been filed with the SEC to
any agreement, document or other instrument which previously had been filed by
the Company with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.



 

22 _Section 4.8 _Disclosure Documents__.



_(a)_ The Proxy Statement and any Other Filings to be made by the Company,
and any amendments or supplements thereto, at (A) the time the Registration
Statement is declared effective, (B) the time the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the stockholders
of the Company, (C) the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, and (D) the
Effective Time, will comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other
applicable Laws.



_(b)_ The Proxy Statement and any Other Filings to be made by the Company,
and any amendments or supplements thereto, do not, and will not, at (A) the
time the Registration Statement is declared effective, (B) the time the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to
the stockholders of the Company, (C) the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, and (E) the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The representations
and warranties contained in this (b) will not apply to statements or omissions
included in the Proxy Statement or any Other Filings based upon information
furnished in writing to the Company by Parent or Merger Sub specifically for
use therein.



_Section 4.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events__. Since December 31, 2003,
except as specifically contemplated by, or as disclosed in, this Agreement or
the Company SEC Filings or Section 4.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
there has not been (a) any Company Material Adverse Effect or (b) any of the
following:



(i) any amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the
Company;



(ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend on, or
other distribution (whether in cash, stock, property or a combination
thereof) with respect to any of its capital shares (other than dividends paid

owned Company Subsidiary); 



(iii) any reclassification, combination, split, subdivision, or issuance or

of their employment or services pursuant to the terms of their pre-existing
stock option or purchase agreements;



(iv) any granting by the Company or any of Company Subsidiary of any

for bonuses made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, or any granting by the Company or any of Company Subsidiary of any
increase in severance or termination pay or any entry by the Company or any
of Company Subsidiary into, or modification or amendment of any currently
effective employment, severance, termination or indemnification agreement or
any agreement the benefits of which are contingent or the terms of which are
materially altered upon the occurrence of a transaction involving the Company
of the nature contemplated by this Agreement;



 

23 (v) entry by the Company or any of Company Subsidiary into any licensing or
other agreement with regard to the acquisition or disposition of any material
Company Intellectual Property other than licenses and agreements entered into
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

Company Material Contract in effect since the date of the Company Balance
Sheet;

connection with compliance with Section 404 of SOXA;



(viii) any material revaluation by the Company of any of its assets
other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;



(ix) any cancellation by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any
material debts or waiver of any claims or rights of material value;



(x) any issuance or sale of any debt securities of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, any incurrence of any liability or obligation for borrowed
money (other than any borrowings under the Companys revolving credit
agreements with Comerica Bank and Wells Fargo as in effect on the date hereof,
and any refinancing thereof or amendment thereto that does not increase the
principal amount of loans available thereunder) or any liability or
obligation as guarantor with respect to the obligations of others, any grant
of any security interest, pledge or lien on any material assets or properties
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the making of any loan to any
person (other than a Company Subsidiary) outside the ordinary course of
business;



(xi) any sale, transfer or other disposition outside of the ordinary course of
business of any material properties or assets (real, personal or
mixed, tangible or intangible) by the Company or any of Company Subsidiary;



(xii) any material damage, destruction or loss, whether or not covered by
insurance, affecting the assets, properties or business of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary; or



(xiii) any agreement, whether in writing or otherwise, to take any action
described in this section by the Company or any of Company Subsidiary.



_Section 4.10 _Employee Benefit Plans__.



_(a)_ Section 4.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true
and complete list of each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA and any other plan, policy, program, practice, agreement,
understanding or arrangement (whether written or oral) providing compensation
or other benefits to any current or former director, officer, employee or
consultant (or to any dependent or beneficiary thereof of the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate), which are now, maintained, sponsored or contributed to
by the Company or



 

24 any ERISA Affiliate, or under which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has any
obligation or liability, whether actual or contingent, including, without
limitation, all material incentive, bonus, deferred compensation, vacation,
holiday, cafeteria, medical, dental, life, accident, disability, stock
purchase, stock option, stock appreciation, phantom stock, restricted stock
or other stock-based compensation plans, policies, programs, practices or

knowledge of the Company, any other person or entity has any express or
implied commitment, whether legally enforceable or not, to modify, change or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan, other than with respect to a modification,
change or termination required by ERISA or the Code.



With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has made available
to Parent true and complete copies of (A) each Company Benefit Plan (or, if
not written a written summary of its material terms), including without

Subsidiary, (B) all severance programs and policies of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary with or relating to its employees, and (C) all plans,

Company or any Company Subsidiary or affiliate from the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or affiliate under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, (B)

for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have
been asserted or instituted against any Company Benefit Plan, any fiduciaries
thereof with respect to their duties to the Company Benefit Plans or the

_Section 5.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_._



_(a)_ Parent has timely filed or furnished all registration statements,
prospectuses, forms, reports and documents required to be filed or furnished
by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since
June 30, 2001 (collectively, the "Parent SEC Filings"). Each Parent SEC Filing
(A) as of its date complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (B) did not
at the time it was filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.



_(b)_ Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any notes thereto) contained in the Parent SEC Filings (the "Parent Financial
Statements") was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited quarterly
financial statements, as permitted on Form 10-Q, 8-K or any successor
form under the Exchange Act) on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and each
presented fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position,
results of operations and cash flows of Parent as of the respective dates
thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case
of unaudited statements, to normal year-end adjustments which were not and
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
material). The books and records of Parent have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with applicable legal and
accounting requirements, and the Parent Financial Statements are
consistent with such books and records.



_(c)_ Parent has in place the "disclosure controls and procedures" (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) required in
order for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Parent to
engage in the review and evaluation process mandated by Section 302 of SOXA.
The "disclosure controls and procedures" of Parent are reasonably designed to
ensure that material information (both financial and non-financial) relating
to Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to Parents principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Parent
required by Section 302 of SOXA with respect to such reports. Except as
reflected in the Parent Financial Statements, neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary is a party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements (as
defined in Item 303(c)



 

41 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act). To Parents knowledge,
KPMG LLP, which has expressed its opinion with respect to the financial
statements of Parent and its subsidiaries included in Parent SEC Filings
(including the related notes), is "independent" with respect to Parent within
the meaning of Regulation S-X. Parent has made such disclosure of non-audit
services performed by KPMG LLP in its proxy statements with respect to its
annual meetings of stockholders as is required under the rules and regulations
of the SEC.



_(d)_ Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet
of Parent and the consolidated Parent Subsidiaries as of October 31, 2003
included in the Parent Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2003,
including the notes thereto, none of Parent or any consolidated Parent
Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent, determined, determinable or otherwise), other than (i)
liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since October 31, 2003 that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, (x) reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (y) have a Parent Material Adverse Effect
or (ii) fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby

supplements thereto, at (A) the time the Registration Statement is declared
effective, (B) the time the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto) is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and (C)

is in conflict with, or in default or violation of, any Law applicable to

guidances or orders administered or issued by the FDA or any other

any Parent Subsidiary are being conducted in compliance with all applicable
Laws and guidances of the FDA or any other Governmental Entity, including
without limitation, the FDAs current Good Clinical Practice regulations and

Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent, nor any Parent Subsidiary, is
the subject, officially or otherwise, of any pending or threatened
investigation by the FDA pursuant to its "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material
Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities" Final Policy set forth in 56 Fed.
Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991), and any amendments thereto. Neither Parent,

reasonably likely to result in a breach of the Company Boards fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company, the Company may, in response to
such Acquisition Proposal and subject to the Companys compliance with,
Section 6.7(b) and Section 6.7(c), (x) furnish information with respect
to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement the
terms of which are no more favorable to the other party to such
confidentiality agreement than those in place with Parent and (y) participate
in discussions and negotiations with respect to such Acquisition Proposal.
Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause the
Company Representatives and, to the extent within the Companys control, its
other affiliates and the Company Affiliate Representatives to, cease
immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions,
conversations, negotiations and other communications with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal and promptly request that all confidential
information with respect thereto furnished on behalf of the Company be
returned. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company agrees that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.7 by any of the
Companys Representatives or affiliates or the Company Affiliate
Representatives, whether or not purporting to act on behalf of the Company,
shall constitute a breach of this Section 6.7 by the Company; and that any
breach of, or failure to observe, any of the provisions of this Section 6.7 by
the Company as a result of any action by any executive officer, or member of
the Board of Directors, of the Company, or of which the Company does not
notify Parent promptly upon any of its executive officers or directors
becoming informed thereof, shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement
by the Company and, for purposes of Section 6.19(d), a breach in a material
respect of this Section 6.7.



_(b)_ The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt thereof), (1) provide written notification to Parent of any
submission, proposal, offer or inquiry received by it relating to any
potential Acquisition Proposal and of the material terms of any proposal or
inquiry, including the identity of the person and its affiliates making the
same, that it may receive in respect of any such potential Acquisition
Proposal, or of any information requested from it or of any negotiations or
discussions being sought to be initiated with it, (2) furnish to Parent a copy
of any such proposal or inquiry, if it is in writing, or a written summary of
any such proposal or inquiry, if it is not in writing and (3) keep Parent
informed on a prompt basis with respect to any developments with respect to
the foregoing, including any changes in price, structure, form of
consideration or closing conditions.



 

54 _(c)_ Subject to the provisions of this Section 6.7(c), neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (A) withdraw or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval or
recommendation by the Company Board or such committee of the adoption and
approval of the Merger (the "Company Recommendation") and the matters to be
considered at the Company Stockholders Meeting, (B) other than the Merger,
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal or (C) other than the Merger, cause the Company to enter
into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or
other similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal. Nothing contained
in this Section 6.7(c) shall prohibit the Company Board (x) from taking and
disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9
or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company Board shall not recommend that the stockholders of
the Company tender their shares in connection with a tender offer, except to
the extent the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment that
failure to make such a recommendation is reasonably likely to result in a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to stockholders under
applicable Law, after consulting with outside legal counsel, or (y) in the
event that a Superior Proposal is made prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting, from withdrawing or modifying the Company Recommendation if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that failure to withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation is
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
Board shall not withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation prior to the
date that is five (5) business days following Parents receipt of written
notice of the Company Boards determination to do so (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to the amount or form or other material term of the
Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new five (5) business day
period); _provided_ ,  _further_ that (i) the Company continues to comply
with all other provisions of this Agreement including, without limitation,
this Section 6.7 hereof, (ii) such action is in response to a Superior
Proposal that did not result from a breach by the Company of this Section 6.7
and (iii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall, during such five (5)
business day period, negotiate in good faith with Parent to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that
the Company Board would no longer determine in good faith that such third
party Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.



_(d)_ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.7,
in the event Parent takes any of the actions permitted in Section 6.19(a)(x)
or (y) or breaches in any material respect the provisions of Section 6.19, the
restrictions set forth in Section 6.7(a) will cease to be in effect, but the
Company will still be bound by the provisions set forth in Section 6.7(b) and
(c). 



_Section 6.8 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_._



_(a)_ The Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to (A)
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (B) obtain from any Governmental
Entity any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or
orders required to be obtained or made by Parent or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any action or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity (including,



 

55 without limitation, those in connection with the HSR Act), in connection with
the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, including, without
limitation, the Merger, (C) make all necessary filings, and thereafter make
any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger
required under (x) the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and any other
applicable federal or state securities Laws, (y) the HSR Act and (z) any other
applicable Law and (D) contest any action by any Governmental Entity seeking
to restrain, enjoin, impose conditions upon or alter the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the
Company shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all
such filings, including providing copies of all such documents to counsel for
the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested, to
accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection
therewith; _provided, however_ , that nothing in this Section 6.8(a) shall
require Parent to agree to (AA) the imposition of conditions, (BB) the
requirement of divestiture of assets or property or (CC) the requirement of
expenditure of money by Parent or the Company to a third party in exchange
for any such consent. The Company and Parent shall furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing under the rules and
regulations of any applicable Law (including all information required to be
included in the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement) in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



To the extent reasonably practicable, neither Parent nor the Company shall
agree to participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry concerning
this Agreement or the Merger unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or
discussion.



_(b) _ The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, all reasonable best efforts to obtain any
third party consents, (A) necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, (B) required to be disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, (C)
required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to
or after the Effective Time or a Parent Material Adverse Effect from occurring
after the Effective Time or (D) otherwise referenced in Section 7.1(e) or
Section 7.2(d). In the event that either party shall fail to obtain any
third party consent described in the first sentence of this Section 6.8(b),
such party shall use all reasonable best efforts, and shall take any such
actions reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any
adverse effect upon the Company and Parent, their respective subsidiaries,
and their respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be
expected to result from the failure to obtain such consent.



_(c)_ From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each party
shall promptly notify the other party in writing of any pending or, to the
knowledge of such party, threatened action, suit, arbitration or other
proceeding or investigation by any Governmental Entity or any other person (A)
challenging or seeking material damages in connection with the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the conversion of
Company Common Shares into Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger or (B)
seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise limit the
right of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to own or operate all



 

56 or any portion of the businesses or assets of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. Each party shall give the other reasonable opportunity to
participate in (but not to conduct, or direct the conduct of) the defense of
or negotiations with respect to any such action, suit, arbitration or other
proceeding or investigation; _provided_ that the party that is subject to
such action, suit, arbitration or other proceeding or investigation shall be
entitled to control the defense thereof.



_(d)_ Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, the Company and their respective
Boards of Directors shall (x) take all action necessary so that no takeover
statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the
Merger, this Agreement or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (y) if any takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, take all action necessary so that the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



_(e)_ The Company agrees to provide, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries
and its and their respective officers and employees to provide, and will use
reasonable best efforts to cause its accountants, attorneys and other
representatives to provide, reasonable cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of any financing to be consummated contemporaneous with the
Closing in respect of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



_Section 6.9_ [Intentionally Omitted.] __



_Section 6.10_ __Certain Notices__. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other
party hereto of (A) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which would be likely to cause (1) any
representation or warranty contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate at any
time during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the
Effective Time or (2) any condition to the obligations of any party to effect
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied or (B) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be
expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to
be satisfied; _provided, however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 6.10 shall not cure any breach of any representation or
warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this
Agreement, affect the satisfaction or non-satisfaction of any condition to the
Merger set forth in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

 



_Section 6.11_ __Public Announcements__. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, none of the parties hereto shall issue any press release or make
any public announcement concerning the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the
other party, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
unless a party determines in good faith that any such disclosure is otherwise
required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of the NYSE or Nasdaq,
as applicable;  _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any such release
or disclosure is so required, prior to making such



 

57 release or disclosure, the party intending to make such release or disclosure
shall use its reasonable best efforts consistent with such applicable Law or
rules or regulations of the NYSE or Nasdaq, as applicable, to consult and
discuss in good faith with the other parties the form and content thereof
prior to its release and consider in good faith any reasonable changes which
are suggested by such party or parties prior to releasing or making the
statement.



_Section 6.12_ __Stock Exchange Listing__. Parent shall promptly prepare and
submit to the NYSE and any other applicable exchange a listing application
covering the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such shares to be approved for
listing on such NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.



_Section 6.13_ __Company Stock Options, Employee Benefit and Related
Matters__.



_(a)_ As of the Effective Time, and subject to the terms of each applicable
plan, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary other than employees covered
by a collective bargaining agreement or similar arrangement specifying any
terms or conditions of work (the "Continuing Employees") with benefits under
medical, dental, vision and similar health and welfare plans that are in the
aggregate no less favorable than either those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and Parent Subsidiaries or to those provided to such
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the extent
satisfied prior to the Effective Time or thereafter under the applicable
medical, dental and vision Company Benefit Plans, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause any medical, dental and vision plans of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary to provide that such Continuing Employees shall be eligible
to participate in as of the Effective Time or thereafter to waive limitations
as to preexisting condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements under such Parent and
Surviving Corporation plans. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause the medical, dental and vision plans of Parent or Parent
Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate as of
the Effective Time or thereafter to provide credit to the Continuing
Employees for any co-payments and deductibles paid by such Continuing
Employees under the applicable medical, dental and vision Company Benefit
Plans for the year in which the Closing occurs for the purposes of satisfying
any applicable co-payments and deductibles under such Parent or Parent
Subsidiary plans for the year in which the Closing occurs. Following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will pay (or cause to be paid)
any bonuses that have accrued with respect to performance prior to the
Effective Time by persons that are employees at the Effective Time, pursuant
to any unpaid bonus plans in effect on the date hereof, at such time as such
bonus otherwise would have been payable under such bonus plan, and the
entitlement of any such employee to any such bonus shall not be impaired by
the termination of his or her employment by Parent or any Subsidiary, other
than termination for cause, thereof following the Effective Time.



_(b)_ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all such other
action as may be necessary (i) to effectuate the treatment of all outstanding
Company Options as of the Effective Time as contemplated in Section 3.4 and
(ii) to terminate, as of the Effective Time, all Company Stock Option Plans
and any plan, program or arrangement providing for the prospective issuance or
grant of any interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or
Company Subsidiary. After the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option Plan
shall be terminated, and no further Company Options shall be granted
thereunder.



 

58 _(c)_ Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company Board, or an
appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, and the Parents
Board of Directors, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors
thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of
the SEC so that the acquisition and disposition by any officer or director of
the Company who may become a covered person of Parent for purposes of Section
16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder ("Section 16")
of shares of Parent Common Stock or options to acquire Parent Common Stock
and Company Common Shares or options to acquire Company Common Shares,
respectively, in each case pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger, shall be
an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16. 



_(d)_ Effective as of the date hereof, the Company Board, or, if appropriate,
any committee of the Company Board administering the ESPP, shall adopt such
resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to provide that the
ESPP shall terminate immediately as of the Effective Time.



_Section 6.14 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_._ 



_(a)_ Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that the indemnification
obligations set forth in the Company Certificate and Company By-laws and any
Company indemnification agreements shall survive the Merger (and, prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Certificate of Incorporation and By-
laws of Merger Sub to reflect such provisions) and shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individual who on or prior
to the Effective Time was a director, officer, trustee, fiduciary, employee
or agent of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or who served at the request
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer, trustee,
partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise,
unless such amendment or modification is required by Law.



_(b)_ For six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall provide to the Companys current directors and officers an insurance
and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior
to the Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance") with a $20,000,000 limit and with
other terms that are no less favorable than the Companys existing policy
(true and complete copies which have been previously provided to Parent) or,
if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess
of 175% of the annual premium to be in effect after August 4, 2004; _provided
further_ that if the premium for such coverage exceeds such amount,
the Surviving Corporation shall purchase the DandO Insurance with the greatest
coverage available for such 175% amount. The provisions of the immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies
have been obtained prior to the Effective Time for purposes of this Section
6.14, which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an
aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, without
limitation, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and
nothing in Section 6.1 shall prohibit the Company from



 

59 obtaining such a prepaid policy prior to the Effective Time, provided that the
cost thereof shall not exceed 175% of the annual premium to be in effect
after August 4, 2004. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder. The obligations under this Section 6.14 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnitee
to whom this Section 6.14 applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this
Section 6.14 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.14),
and in the event that Parent consolidates or merges with any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger, or transfers all or substantially all of its assets
to any other Person, then Parent shall make proper provision so that the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity, or transferee of such assets,
as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.14.



_Section 6.15_ __Plan of Reorganization__. This Agreement is intended to
constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-2(g). Each party hereto shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not knowingly take any
actions or cause any actions to be taken which could reasonably be expected to
prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall each
deliver to counsel to Parent and counsel to the Company, for the purpose of
enabling each such counsel to render the tax opinions described in Sections
7.2(c) and 7.3(c) of this Agreement, representation letters, executed and
dated as of the Closing Date, in form and in substance substantially identical
to those attached hereto as Exhibits C and D respectively (allowing for such
amendments to the representation letters as counsel deems reasonably
necessary).



_Section 6.16_ __Affiliate Letters__. The Company shall, within five business
days of the date hereof, deliver to Parent a list (reasonably satisfactory to
counsel for Parent) setting forth the names of all persons who are expected to
be, at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, "affiliates" of the
Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall
furnish such information and documents as Parent may reasonably request for
the purpose of reviewing the list. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each person who is identified as an affiliate in the list
furnished or supplemented pursuant to this Section 6.16 to execute a written
agreement, as soon as practicable after the date hereof, in substantially the
form of Exhibit B hereto.



_Section 6.17_ __FIRPTA Affidavit__. The Company shall furnish to Parent an
affidavit, dated the Closing Date, stating, under penalty of perjury, that
the Company is not and has not been a United States real property holding
corporation within the meaning of Code Section 897(c)(2) during the applicable
period described in Code Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii). 



_Section 6.18_ __401(k) Plan__. If requested in writing by Parent, the
Company shall, immediately prior to the Closing Date, terminate any of the
Companys or a Company Subsidiarys 401(k) Plan or Company Benefit Plan
maintained under Section 1165 of the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code (each,
a "Plan") effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and
no further contributions shall be made to the Plan as of such termination,
except for contributions that have been accrued on behalf of
participants prior to the Plans termination and contributions made on behalf
of participants that are based on compensation



 

60 earned prior to the date of the Plans termination. The Company shall provide
to the Parent (i) executed resolutions by the Board of Directors of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary authorizing any such requested termination and
(ii) the Company shall take or cause to be taken such further actions in
furtherance of such termination as Parent may reasonably request.



_Section 6.19 _No Solicitation of Transactions by Parent__.



_(a)_ None of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary shall, directly or indirectly,
take (and Parent shall not authorize or permit the Parent Representatives or,
to the extent within Parents control, other affiliates, and their respective
officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
advisors, agents and other representatives (the "Parent Affiliate
Representatives") to take), any action to (A) solicit, initiate, encourage or
facilitate any Parent Acquisition Proposal (including by way of furnishing
non-public information), (B) enter into any agreement or commitment with
respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal (other than confidentiality
agreements permitted by clause (x) below), or enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (C) participate in any way in discussions or negotiations with,
or furnish any information to, any person in connection with, or take any
other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Parent
Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however,_ that if, at any time prior to the
Parent Stockholders Meeting, the Parent Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the Parent Boards
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Parent, Parent may, in response to a
Parent Acquisition Proposal and subject to Parents compliance with Section
6.19(b) and (c), (x) furnish information with respect to Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries to the person making such Parent Acquisition Proposal pursuant
to a customary confidentiality agreement the benefits of the terms of which
are no more favorable to the other party to such confidentiality agreement
than those in place with the Company and (y) participate in discussions and
negotiations with respect to such Parent Acquisition Proposal. Upon execution
of this Agreement, Parent shall, and shall cause the Parent Representatives
and, to the extent within Parents control, its other affiliates and the
Parent Affiliate Representatives, to cease immediately and cause to be
terminated any and all existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and
other communications with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to,
or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Parent Acquisition
Proposal and promptly request that all confidential information with respect
thereto furnished on behalf of Parent be returned. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 6.19 by any of Parents Representatives or affiliates or Parent
Affiliate Representatives, whether or not purporting to act on behalf of
Parent, shall constitute a breach of this Section 6.19 by Parent; and that
any breach of, or failure to observe, any of the provisions of this Section
6.19 by Parent as a result of any action by any executive officer, or member
of the Board of Directors, of Parent, or of which Parent does not notify the
Company promptly upon any of its executive officers or directors becoming
informed thereof, shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by
Parent and, for purposes of Section 6.7(d), a breach in a material respect of
this Section 6.19.



_(b)_ Parent shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt thereof), (1) provide written notification to the Company of any
submission, proposal, offer or



 

61 inquiry received by it relating to any potential Parent Acquisition Proposal
and of the material terms of any proposal or inquiry, including the identity
of the person and its affiliates making the same, that it may receive in
respect of any such potential Parent Acquisition Proposal, or of any
information requested from it or of any negotiations or discussions
being sought to be initiated with it, (2) furnish to the Company a copy of
any such proposal or inquiry, if it is in writing, or a written summary of any
such proposal or inquiry, if it is not in writing and (3) keep the Company
informed on a prompt basis with respect to any developments with respect to
the foregoing, including any changes in price, structure, form of
consideration or closing conditions.



_(c)_ Subject to the provisions of this Section 6.19(c), neither the Parent
Board nor any committee thereof shall (A) withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Company,
the approval or recommendation by Parent Board or such committee of the
approval of the Share Issuance (the "Parent Recommendation") and the matters
to be considered at the Parent Stockholders Meeting, (B) other than the
Merger, approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Parent Acquisition Proposal, or (C) other than the Merger, cause Parent to
enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal.
Nothing contained in this Section 6.19(c) shall prohibit the Parent Board (x)
from taking and disclosing to Parents stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Parent Board shall not recommend that the stockholders
of Parent tender their shares in connection with a tender offer, except to
the extent the Parent Board determines in its good faith judgment that failure
to make such a recommendation is reasonably likely to result in a breach of
the fiduciary duties of the Parent Board to stockholders under applicable Law,
after consulting with outside legal counsel, or (y) in the event that a
Parent Conflicting Proposal is made prior to the Parent Stockholders Meeting,
from withdrawing or modifying the Parent Recommendation if the Parent Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
failure to withdraw or modify the Parent Recommendation is reasonably likely
to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Parent,
_provided_ that the Parent Board shall not withdraw or modify the Parent
Recommendation prior to the date that is five (5) business days following the
Companys receipt of written notice of the Parents Boards determination to
enter into an agreement to effect such Parent Conflicting Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the amount or form or other
material term of the Parent Conflicting Proposal shall require a new notice
and a new five (5) business day period); _provided_ , _further _ that (i)
Parent continues to comply with all other provisions of this Agreement
including, without limitation, Section 6.19 hereof, (ii) such action is in
response to a Parent Conflicting Proposal that did not result from a breach by
Parent of this Section 6.19 and (iii) if requested by the Company, Parent
shall, during such five (5) business day period, negotiate in good faith with
the Company to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that the Parent Board would no longer determine in good faith
that failure to make such an approval or recommendation is reasonably likely
to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Parent Board to
stockholders under applicable Law, after consulting with outside legal
counsel.



_(d)_ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
6.19, in the event the Company takes any of the actions permitted in Section
6.7(a)(x) or (y) or breaches in any material respect the provisions of Section
6.7, the restrictions set forth in Section 6.19(a) will cease to be in effect
but Parent will still be bound by the provisions set forth in Section 6.19(b)
and (c).



 

62 _Section 6.20_ __Board of Directors__. The Parent Board shall add John D.
Fruth and Edgar J. Cummins as members of the Parent Board, effective as of
the Effective Time.

permitted by applicable Law:



_(a)_ _Effectiveness of the Registration Statement_. The Registration
