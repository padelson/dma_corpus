their respective Subsidiaries (other than shares in trust accounts, managed
accounts or other similar accounts for the benefit of customers or shares
held as collateral for outstanding debt previously contracted) immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and each share of Atlantic Common Stock that is
remitted to Atlantic prior to the Effective Time for purposes of repayment of
the Atlantic ESOP Loan as contemplated by _Section 5.10(d)_ , shall be
cancelled and retired at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof,
and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. Such cancelled and retired
shares of Atlantic Common Stock are referred to collectively as the "
_Cancelled Shares_ ".

  



  

(c) Subject to _Section 1.2(f)_ , each share of Atlantic Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than treasury stock and the Cancelled Shares) shall become and be
converted into the right to receive the following consideration, in each case
without interest: (i) an amount of cash equal to $1.39 (the " _Cash
Consideration_ "); and (ii) 0.17 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of Ameris Common Stock together with cash
in lieu of any fractional shares in accordance with the provisions of _Section
1.2(f)_ (the " _Stock Consideration_ ", and together with the Cash
Consideration, per share, the " _Per Share Purchase Price_ " and, in the
aggregate, as adjusted in accordance with the terms hereof, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). Each certificate previously representing such shares of
Atlantic Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent,
subject to _Section 1.3(d)_ , only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. Any reference herein to "Certificate" shall be deemed, as
appropriate, to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to
the ownership of shares of Atlantic Common Stock, and it being further
understood that provisions herein relating to Certificates shall be
interpreted in a manner that appropriately accounts for book-entry shares,
including that, in lieu of delivery of a Certificate and a Letter of
Transmittal, shares held in book-entry form may be transferred by means of an
"agent's message" to the Exchange Agent or such other evidence of transfer as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably request.

(d) At the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Atlantic
Common Stock (an " _Atlantic Stock Option_ ") issued pursuant to Atlantic's
equity-based compensation plans identified in _Section 2.28(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule_ (the " _Atlantic Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall become fully vested and shall be cancelled and converted automatically
into the right to receive a cash payment from Ameris or Ameris Bank (the "
_Cash-Out Amount_ ") in an amount equal to the product of: (i) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration Price over the exercise price of each such
Atlantic Stock Option; and (ii) the number of shares of Atlantic Common Stock
subject to such Atlantic Stock Option to the extent not previously exercised.
After the Effective Time, any such cancelled Atlantic Stock Option shall no
longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle the
holder to the payment of the Cash-Out Amount, without interest. In the event
the exercise price per share of Atlantic Common Stock subject to an Atlantic
Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration Price, such
Atlantic Stock Option shall be cancelled without consideration and have no
further force or effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Merger
Consideration Price_ " means the sum of: (x) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by
the Average Ameris Stock Price; and (y) $1.39.

  



  

(e) At the Effective Time, each award of shares of Atlantic Common
Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction (an "
_Atlantic Restricted Share Award_ ") granted pursuant to the Atlantic Stock
Plans, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall become fully vested and shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect
of each share of Atlantic Common Stock underlying such Atlantic
Restricted Share Award. Prior to the Effective Time, Atlantic shall: (i)
obtain any necessary consents or make any necessary amendments to the terms
of any outstanding Atlantic Restricted Share Awards or Atlantic Stock Plans to
give effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section 1.2(e)_ ; (ii)
take all actions as may be necessary to terminate (and, except as provided in
this _Section 1.2(e)_ , ensure that neither Atlantic nor Atlantic Coast Bank
remains bound by or liable for) any outstanding Atlantic Restricted Share
Awards or other rights to acquire Atlantic Common Stock; and (iii) ensure that
the Atlantic Stock Plans which allow the grant of Atlantic Restricted Share
Awards or other rights to acquire Atlantic Common Stock, if any, will be
amended to eliminate the ability to grant any such Atlantic Restricted Share
Awards or other rights to acquire Atlantic Common Stock effective as of
immediately after the Effective Time. At or as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time (which may be in connection with the payment of
the first regular base salary payment due to such holder following the
Closing, but in any event shall occur within thirty (30) days after the
Effective Time), Ameris or Ameris Bank shall deliver the Merger Consideration
to the holders of Atlantic Restricted Share Awards, without interest. Such
payments may be reduced by any Taxes withheld pursuant to _Section 1.3(g)_.

  



  

   

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) No scrip or fractional share certificates of Ameris Common Stock
shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and an outstanding fractional
share interest will not entitle the owner thereof to vote, to receive
dividends or to have any of the rights of a shareholder with respect to such
fractional interest. In lieu of any fractional interest, there shall be paid
in cash, without interest, an amount (computed to the nearest cent) equal to
such fraction multiplied by the purchase price per share of Atlantic Common
Stock as determined by multiplying: (i) the Exchange Ratio; by (ii) the
Average Ameris Stock Price.

  



  

(g) If either party should change the number of its outstanding
shares as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, reclassification or similar transaction with
respect to such shares prior to the Effective Time, then the shares to be
issued hereunder to holders of Atlantic Common Stock shall be proportionately
and appropriately adjusted; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, for the avoidance
of doubt, no such adjustment shall be made with regard to Ameris Common Stock
if: (i) Ameris issues additional shares of Ameris Common Stock and receives
consideration for such shares in a bona fide merger, acquisition or other
business combination or third-party transaction or in any issuance of
securities in a capital-raising transaction; or (ii) Ameris issues stock
options, restricted stock or restricted stock units or grants or similar
equity awards or Ameris Common Stock upon exercise or vesting of any such
grants or awards.

  



  

1.3 _Delivery of the Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Ameris shall appoint
Computershare Inc. to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") and
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, for the benefit of the holders of
Atlantic Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this _Section 1.3_ ,
through the Exchange Agent: (i) certificates of Ameris Common Stock or, at
Ameris's option, evidence of shares of Ameris Common Stock in book-entry form
(collectively, " _New Certificates_ ") to be issued in exchange for the Stock
Consideration; and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to pay (A) the aggregate
cash portion of the Merger Consideration and (B) cash sufficient to pay cash
in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Section 1.2(f)_ (such
cash and New Certificates described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii),
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Ameris shall, after the
Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable, provide or
cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other
distributions represented by such deposited shares. The Exchange Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Ameris for
Ameris's benefit pending payment thereof by the Exchange Agent to the holders
of Atlantic Common Stock pursuant to this  _Article I_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no investment of such deposited funds directed by Ameris
shall relieve Ameris or the Exchange Agent from promptly making the payments
required by this _Article I_ , and following any losses from any such
investment, Ameris shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Atlantic Common Stock, in the amount
of such losses, which additional funds will be held and disbursed in the same
manner as funds initially deposited with the Exchange Agent. Ameris shall
direct the Exchange Agent to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the
former holders of Atlantic Common Stock and to make payments from the
Exchange Fund in accordance with this _Article I_. The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to this
_Article I_ , except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Ameris shall direct the Exchange Agent to mail no later than
five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time (the mailing date of
such letter of transmittal being referred to herein as the " _Mailing Date_
") to each holder of record of Atlantic Common Stock as of the Effective
Time: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the holder's Certificate or
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, and shall
otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Ameris
may reasonably specify (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "); and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon the surrender of Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
and delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and properly completed,
with respect to such Certificates, the record holder of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration to
be paid therefor pursuant to this _Article I_. No interest shall be paid or
accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. For purposes of
this Agreement, a " _Business Day_ " is any day other than Saturday, Sunday,
a day which is a legal holiday in Florida or Georgia or a day on which
commercial banks in Florida or Georgia are authorized or required by
Applicable Law to close.

  



  

(c) As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Atlantic
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Atlantic Common Stock on the records of Atlantic. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article I_ with
respect to any Atlantic Common Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining thereto. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of shares of Atlantic Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior thereto shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except as
otherwise provided for herein or by Applicable Law.

  



  

(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Atlantic
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Atlantic Common
Stock with respect to the shares of Ameris Common Stock represented thereby,
in each case unless and until the surrender of each outstanding share of such
Atlantic Common Stock in accordance with this _Section 1.3_. Subject to the
effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, following
surrender of any such share of such Atlantic Common Stock in accordance with
this _Section 1.3_ , the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive,
without interest: (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the
whole shares of Ameris Common Stock represented by such Atlantic Common Stock
and paid prior to such surrender date; and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to shares of Ameris Common Stock represented by such Atlantic Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender
date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Ameris Common
Stock issuable with respect to such Atlantic Common Stock.

(e) At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective
Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority), Ameris shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver
to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest or investment
income received with respect thereto) not disbursed to holders of Atlantic
Common Stock, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to
Ameris (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates and compliance with the
procedures set forth in this _Section 1.3_ , without
interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Ameris nor the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of Atlantic Common Stock for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Governmental Authority_ " means any governmental, regulatory or
administrative body, agency, commission, board or authority, or any court or
judicial authority, to which a party is subject, whether
international, national, federal, state or local.

  



  

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Exchange Agent or Ameris, as applicable, shall issue in exchange therefor
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration into which such shares of Atlantic Common Stock formerly
represented thereby were converted pursuant to this _Article_ I; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Exchange Agent, or Ameris, as applicable, may, in its
reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such
Merger Consideration, as applicable, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate to deliver a customary indemnity agreement or provide a
bond in a customary amount.

  



  

(g) Ameris and Ameris Bank are entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted on a timely basis to the
appropriate Governmental Authority by or on behalf of Ameris or Ameris Bank,
such amounts withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Person_ " means any
natural person, bank, corporation, association, partnership, limited
liability company, organization, business, firm, trust, joint venture,
unincorporated organization or any other entity or organization, including a
Governmental Authority.

(5) Business Days after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in

material personal property (such property, the " _Leased Property_ ") are set
forth in _Section 2.26(a) of the Disclosure Schedule_. All Atlantic Leases
are valid and enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to the
General Enforceability Exceptions; there is not under any of the Atlantic
Leases any material default or any claimed default by Atlantic or any of its
Subsidiaries, the lessor (where Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries is the
lessee under an Atlantic Lease) or the lessee (where Atlantic or any of its
Subsidiaries is the lessor under an Atlantic Lease), or event of material
default or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a material default by Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries, the
lessor (where Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries is the lessee under an
Atlantic Lease) or the lessee (where Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries is
the lessor under an Atlantic Lease) and in respect of which adequate steps
have not been taken to prevent a default from occurring if Atlantic or any of
its Subsidiaries is the party in breach.

Atlantic has good title to the Atlantic Realty, and neither Atlantic nor any
of its Subsidiaries has encumbered any of the Atlantic Realty with a
mortgage, deed of trust or other monetary lien that has not been satisfied or
cancelled.

  



  

(b) The interests of Atlantic or its Subsidiaries in the Atlantic

(b) _Section 2.28(b) of the Disclosure Schedule_ lists separately
any employee benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")
(whether or not subject to ERISA), sponsored, maintained or contributed to by
Atlantic or its ERISA Affiliates or with respect to which Atlantic or any of
its ERISA Affiliates has any liability (direct or indirect, contingent, as
the result of any indemnity or guaranty or otherwise) (collectively, "
_ERISA Plans_ "). True, correct and complete copies of all ERISA Plans and,

(d) Each Atlantic Plan has been established, operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and in
accordance with, and has been amended to comply with (unless such amendment
is not yet required), all Applicable Laws, including ERISA, the Code and the
regulations issued under ERISA and the Code. With respect to each Atlantic
Plan, other than routine claims for benefits submitted in the ordinary course
of the benefits process and in accordance with the express terms of such
Atlantic Plans, no litigation or administrative or other proceeding is
pending or, to the knowledge of Atlantic, threatened involving such Atlantic
Plan or any of its assets or fiduciaries. With respect to each Atlantic Plan,
neither Atlantic nor any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees or agents or any fiduciary of any Atlantic Plan
has been engaged in or been a party to any transaction relating to the
Atlantic Plan which could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of
fiduciary duty under ERISA or a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is
defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code), unless such
transaction is specifically permitted under Sections 407 or 408 of ERISA,
Section 4975 of the Code or a class or administrative exemption issued by the
Department of Labor. Each Atlantic Plan that is a group health plan within the
meaning of Section 607(l) of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code is in
material compliance with: (i) the continuation coverage requirements of
Section 501 of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code and other Applicable Laws;
and (ii) the applicable requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act, as amended.

  



  

(e) With respect to each Atlantic Plan, all contributions or other
remittances required by such plan or Applicable Law have been made, or will
be made, on a timely basis.

  



  

(f) Each Atlantic Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code, and its related trust, respectively, has
received a favorable determination letter (or opinion letter) from the IRS as
to the qualification of such plan and the tax-exempt status of the related
trust (or has filed with the IRS a request for such a determination letter
within the applicable remedial amendment period or is a prototype plan for
which the prototype plan sponsor has received a favorable opinion letter or
advisory opinion from the IRS as to the qualification of the prototype plan
on which Atlantic or its applicable Subsidiary may rely) and, to
the knowledge of Atlantic, no event has occurred, and no condition exists,
that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualified or tax-
exempt status or the imposition of any liability, tax or penalty under ERISA
or the Code.

  



  

(g) Neither Atlantic nor any of its Subsidiaries provides or has any
obligation to provide benefits, including death, health, post-retirement life
insurance or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to
current or former employees of Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries or their
spouses, dependents or beneficiaries beyond the employees' retirement or other
termination of employment or service with Atlantic or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than coverage mandated by Applicable Law and at the sole
expense of such employees or their spouses, dependents or beneficiaries.

(h) Except as set forth in _Section 2.28(h) of the Disclosure
Schedule_ , neither this Agreement nor any transaction contemplated
hereby (either alone or in combination with any other event) will: (i)
entitle any current or former employee, officer, director or other service
provider of Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries to any payment or benefit,
including any bonus, retention, severance pay, retirement pay, unemployment
compensation or any similar or other payment; (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting of, or increase the amount of compensation or benefits due
any such employee, officer, director or other service provider; (iii)
increase any benefits, or accelerate the time of payment or any benefits,
otherwise payable under any Atlantic Plan; (iv) trigger any
material obligation under any Atlantic Plan, including any funding thereof;
or (v) cause the payment of any "excess parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G of the Code). No Atlantic Plan provides for the gross up of Taxes
under Code Sections 409A or 4999.

  



  

(i) Each Atlantic Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code
has been maintained in written form, and administered and operated,
in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations and rulings thereunder.

  



  

(j) There is no audit or investigation pending with respect to any
Atlantic Plan before any Governmental Authority and, to the knowledge of
Atlantic, no such audit or investigation is threatened.

  



  

(k) Atlantic has properly accrued on its financial statements in all
material respects the correct number of days for all vacation, sick
leave, personal time and paid time off credited to employees and individual
consultants of Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date of such
financial statements. Atlantic or its applicable Subsidiary has, for each
Atlantic Plan and all other purposes, including Taxes and participation in
Atlantic Plans, correctly classified all natural persons and, if applicable,
their disregarded entities providing services to Atlantic or any of its
Subsidiaries as common law employees or independent contractors, as
appropriate.

  



  

(l) Neither Atlantic nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into
any commitment to modify or amend any Atlantic Plan (other than in the
ordinary course and consistent with past practice or as required by
Applicable Law) or to establish any new benefit plan, program or
arrangement. There has been no amendment to any Atlantic Plan, interpretation
or announcement by Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any
Atlantic Plan or written notice or arrangement, or change in eligibility,
participation or coverage under any Atlantic Plan, that would increase the
expense of maintaining any such Atlantic Plan above the level of expense
incurred or with respect to such Atlantic Plan for the most-recently
completed fiscal year of Atlantic and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(m) Each pension plan, within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA,
that is not intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is
exempt from Parts 2, 3 and 4 of ERISA as an unfunded plan that is maintained
primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select
group of management or highly compensated employees pursuant to Sections
201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. No assets of any such pension plan
have been set aside to pay the obligations under such pension plan in a rabbi
trust or otherwise.

  



  

(n) The Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (the " _Atlantic ESOP_ ") grants to its participants full
voting rights as to all shares of Atlantic Common Stock held by the Atlantic
ESOP on behalf of such participants and that have been allocated to their
accounts.

Subsidiaries is, or has been, a party to any collective bargaining
agreement or agreement of any kind with any union or labor organization or to
any agreement with any of its employees which is not terminable at will or
upon ninety (90) days' notice at the election of, and without cost or penalty
to, Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Atlantic nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received at any time in the past five (5) years any demand
for recognition from any union, and no attempt has been made during such time
to organize any of its employees. Atlantic and its Subsidiaries have
complied in all material respects with all obligations under the National

amended, and all other federal, state and local labor Laws applicable to

Atlantic, threatened against Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries; and (b)
there are, and in the past three (3) years there have been, no charges,
complaints, claims or proceedings, pending, or to the knowledge of Atlantic,
threatened against, or involving, as the case may be, Atlantic or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any alleged violation of any wage and hour Laws,
age discrimination act Laws, employment discrimination Laws or any other
claims arising out of any employment relationship as to any of employee of
Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries or as to any person seeking employment
therefrom, and no such violations exist. All employees and

extensions of credit made on substantially the same terms, including interest
rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions by Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries with other Persons who
are not affiliated with Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries, and which do not
involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable
features; (b) deposits, all of which are on terms and conditions identical to
those made available to all customers of Atlantic Coast Bank at the time such
deposits were entered into; and (c) transactions specifically described in
_Section 2.30 of the Disclosure Schedule_ , there are no contracts with or
commitments to present or former five percent (5%) or greater stockholders,
directors, officers or employees involving the expenditure of more than
$50,000 as to any one individual, including with respect to any business

contracts or commitments in the aggregate for all such individuals (other
than contracts or commitments relating to services to be performed by any
officer, director or employee as a currently-employed employee of Atlantic or
any of its Subsidiaries).

  



  

2.31 _Approvals, Consents and Filings_. Except for the Required
Regulatory Approvals, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will:

Statement_ ") under the Securities Act on Form S-4 (or other applicable form)
covering the issuance of the shares of Ameris Common Stock to the stockholders
of Atlantic pursuant to this Agreement and to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Ameris Registration Statement to become effective and to

(b) Ameris agrees to list on The NASDAQ Global Select Market ("
_NASDAQ_ "), by the Closing Date, the shares of Ameris Common Stock to be
issued to the stockholders of Atlantic pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

5.2 _Meeting of Atlantic Stockholders_.

  



  

(a) Atlantic shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a special
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ") as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Ameris Registration Statement becomes
effective under the Securities Act for the purpose of submitting the Merger
and this Agreement to such stockholders for their approval. Except with the
prior approval of Ameris, no other matters shall be submitted for the
approval of the stockholders of Atlantic at the Special Meeting. In connection
with the Special Meeting, Ameris and Atlantic shall together prepare and
submit to the Atlantic stockholders a notice of meeting, proxy statement and
proxy (the " _Atlantic Proxy Materials_ "), which shall include the final
prospectus from the Ameris Registration Statement in the form filed with the
SEC. Atlantic shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval
of the Merger and shall take all other actions necessary or advisable to
secure the vote or consent of the stockholders of Atlantic required by
Applicable Law to obtain such approval. Atlantic shall keep Ameris updated
with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by Ameris.
Once the Special Meeting has been called and noticed, Atlantic shall not
postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting without the consent of Ameris (other
than in order to obtain a quorum of the stockholders of Atlantic or as
reasonably determined by Atlantic to comply with Applicable Law).

  



  

(b) Except as provided in this _Section 5.2(b)_ , the board of
directors Atlantic shall communicate to the stockholders of Atlantic
the board's recommendation that the stockholders adopt and approve this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the
" _Atlantic Recommendation_ "), and include the Atlantic Recommendation in the
Atlantic Proxy Materials. Neither the Atlantic board of directors nor any
committee thereof shall: (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly
to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Ameris or any of
Ameris's Subsidiaries, the Atlantic Recommendation; or (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal (each, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, prior to the Requisite Atlantic Stockholder
Approval, Atlantic's board of directors may make an Adverse Recommendation
Change if: (A) Atlantic's board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with Atlantic's financial advisor and outside counsel, that it
has received an Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of
_Section 4.19_ ) that is a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal
has not been withdrawn; (B) Atlantic's board of directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with Atlantic's outside counsel, that a failure to
accept such Superior Proposal would be reasonably likely to result in a breach
of the fiduciary duties of the members of the board of directors of Atlantic
under Applicable Law; (C) Atlantic's board of directors provides written
notice (a " _Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") to Ameris of its receipt of
the Superior Proposal and its intent to announce an Adverse Recommendation
Change on the third (3rd) Business Day following delivery of such notice,
which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal (it being understood that any amendment to any material term of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Recommendation Change); (D)
after providing such Notice of Recommendation Change, Atlantic negotiates in
good faith with Ameris (if requested by Ameris) and provides Ameris reasonable
opportunity during the three (3)-Business Day period following the Notice of
Recommendation Change to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement as would enable Atlantic's board of directors to proceed
without an Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
Ameris shall not be required to propose any such adjustments; and (E)
Atlantic's board of directors, following the final such three (3)-Business
Day period, again determines in good faith, after consultation with
Atlantic's financial advisor and outside counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal nonetheless continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach
of the fiduciary duties of the members of the board of directors of Atlantic
under Applicable Law.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

(i) The term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means: (A) any proposal or
offer with respect to a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation,
dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization,
rights offering, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction
involving Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries; or (B) any acquisition by any
Person resulting in, or proposal or offer, which, if consummated, would
result in, any Person becoming the beneficial owner, directly or
indirectly, of more than twenty percent (20%) of the total voting power of
any class of equity securities of Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries, or
more than twenty percent (20%) of the consolidated total assets of Atlantic or
any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(ii) The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal with respect to which the board of directors of
Atlantic: (A) determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal, if
accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated on a timely basis, taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
Acquisition Proposal and the Person making the Acquisition Proposal; and (B)
determines in good faith (based on, among other things, the advice of
Atlantic's financial advisor) to be more favorable to Atlantic's stockholders
than the Merger taking into account all relevant factors (including whether,
in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of Atlantic, after
obtaining the advice of the Atlantic's financial advisor, the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably able to finance the transaction and
close it timely, and any proposed changes to this Agreement that may be
proposed by Ameris in response to such Acquisition Proposal); _provided_ , 
_however_ that for purposes of the definition of Superior Proposal, the
references to twenty percent (20%) in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to fifty percent (50%).

5.3 _Access to Properties, Books and Records_. Atlantic shall
allow Ameris and its authorized representatives full access, upon
reasonable prior notice, during normal business hours from and after the date
hereof and prior to the Closing Date to all of Atlantic's properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records and those of its Subsidiaries and shall
furnish Ameris and its authorized representatives such information concerning
its affairs and the affairs of its Subsidiaries as Ameris may reasonably
request; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such request shall be reasonably
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
not interfere unreasonably with normal operations. Atlantic shall cause its
and its Subsidiaries' personnel, employees and other representatives to
assist Ameris in making any such investigation. During such investigation,
Ameris and its authorized representatives shall have the right to make copies
of such records, files, Tax Returns and other materials as it may deem
advisable and shall advise Atlantic of those items of which copies are made.
No investigation made heretofore or hereafter by Ameris and its
authorized representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of
Atlantic hereunder.

parties to this Agreement have provided and will provide one another with
information which may be deemed by the party providing the information to be
confidential, including information regarding such party's operations,
customers (including consumer financial information), business and financial
condition. Each party agrees that it will hold confidential and protect all
information provided to it by each other party or such party's affiliates or
representatives, except that the obligations contained in this _Section 5.4_
shall not in any way restrict the rights of any party to use
information that: (a) was known to such party prior to the disclosure by the
other party; (b) is or becomes generally available to the public other than
by breach of this Agreement; (c) is provided by one party for disclosure
concerning such party in the Ameris Registration Statement; or (d) otherwise
becomes lawfully available to a party to this Agreement on a non-confidential
basis from a third party who is not under an obligation of confidence to the
other party to this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Closing, then, upon request, each party hereto agrees to return all
documents, statements and other written materials, whether or not
confidential, and all copies thereof, provided to it by or on behalf of the
other party to this Agreement. The provisions of this _Section 5.4_ shall
survive termination, for any reason whatsoever, of this Agreement, and,
without limiting the remedies of the parties hereto in the event of any
breach of this _Section 5.4_ , the parties hereto will be entitled to seek
injunctive relief against the other party in the event of a breach or
threatened breach of this _Section 5.4_.

  



  

5.5 _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts in
good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary or advisable so as to permit consummation of
the Merger as promptly as practicable and shall cooperate fully with each
other to that end.

  



  

5.6 _Expenses_. All of the expenses incurred by Ameris in
connection with the authorization, preparation, execution and performance of
this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement, including all fees and expenses
of its agents, representatives, counsel and accountants and the fees and
expenses related to filing the Ameris Registration Statement and all
regulatory applications with state and federal authorities in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, shall be paid by Ameris. All
expenses incurred by Atlantic in connection with the authorization,
preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the Bank Merger
Agreement, including all fees and expenses of its agents, representatives,

5.7 _Preservation of Business and Goodwill_. Each party hereto
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, during the period
from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, conduct its
business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice,
except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or as required by
Applicable Law or with the prior written consent of the other party, and use
its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve its business organization, to
keep available the services of its present employees and to preserve the
goodwill of customers and others having business relations with it.

  



  

5.8 _Approvals and Consents_. Each party hereto represents and
warrants to and covenants with the other that it will use its
commercially reasonable efforts, and will cause its officers, directors,
employees and agents and its Subsidiaries and any Subsidiary's officers,
directors, employees and agents to use their commercially reasonable efforts,
to obtain as promptly as is reasonably practicable all regulatory
authorizations, consents, orders or approvals from: (a) the Federal Reserve,
the FDIC and the GDBF; and (b) any other approvals set forth in _Section
2.31_ that are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger and the Bank Merger, or those the failure of
which to be obtained would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Ameris or Atlantic (collectively,
the " _Required Regulatory Approvals_ "). Ameris shall file all applications
or notices for Required Regulatory Approvals within forty-five (45) days.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
require Ameris, or require or permit Atlantic, to take any action, or commit
to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection
with obtaining the Required Regulatory Approvals that would: (i) reasonably
be expected to result in Ameris or Ameris Bank becoming subject to any cease-
and-desist order or other order, formal or informal enforcement action issued
by, or written agreement, consent agreement, operating agreement, memorandum
of understanding, commitment letter or similar undertaking with, or any
request to adopt any board resolutions by, any Governmental Authority; or
(ii) reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Ameris and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any determination by any Governmental
Authority that the Bank Merger may not be consummated as contemplated in the
Bank Merger Agreement or in a substantially similar manner
immediately following the Effective Time) (any of the foregoing matters in
clauses (i) and (ii), a " _Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

  



  

5.9 _Press Releases_. Prior to the Closing Date, Ameris and
Atlantic must each approve the form, substance and timing of any
press release or other public disclosure materially related to this Agreement
or any other transaction contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,  _however_ _,_
that nothing in this _Section 5.9_ shall be deemed to prohibit Ameris or
Atlantic from making any disclosure which its counsel deems necessary or
advisable in order to satisfy Ameris's or Atlantic's, as the case may be,
disclosure obligations imposed by any Applicable Law or stock exchange
listing requirement.

5.10 _Employee Benefits and Agreements_.

  



  

(a) Following the Closing Date, Ameris shall, or shall cause its
applicable Subsidiary to, provide generally to employees of Atlantic and
its Subsidiaries who continue employment with Ameris or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (" _Atlantic Continuing Employees_ ")
medical, dental, vacation and long-term disability benefits, medical and
dependent care flexible spending accounts, severance and life insurance
(collectively, " _Employee Benefits_ "), on terms and conditions
consistent in all material respects with those then currently provided by
Ameris or its Subsidiaries to its other similarly-situated employees. For
purposes of eligibility to participate and any vesting determinations (but not
benefit accruals) in connection with the provision of any such Employee
Benefits by Ameris or its Subsidiaries to the Atlantic Continuing Employees,
service with Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date
shall be counted to the extent such service was counted under the similar plan
of Atlantic or its Subsidiary. The Atlantic Continuing Employees' prior
service with Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries shall also be credited for
purposes of all waiting periods for participation in any of such Employee
Benefits to the extent such service was counted under the similar plan of
Atlantic or its Subsidiary. Ameris or its applicable Subsidiary shall also
waive all restrictions and limitations for preexisting conditions under
Ameris's Employee Benefit plans, to the extent such restrictions or
limitations would not apply to the Atlantic Continuing Employees under the
similar plan of Atlantic or its Subsidiary. Ameris or its
applicable Subsidiary shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
the Atlantic Continuing Employees with credit under Ameris's group health
Employee Benefit plans, for the plan year of such plans which includes the
Closing Date, towards any applicable deductibles under Ameris's group health
Employee Benefit plans for the aggregate amounts paid by such employees toward
applicable deductibles under Atlantic's group health Employee Benefit plans
for the plan year of such plans which includes the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) Subject to applicable legal requirements, Ameris and Atlantic
shall take such other actions prior to the Closing Date as may be
reasonably necessary to enable the employees of Atlantic and its Subsidiaries
after the Closing Date to rollover the amount credited to their accounts
under the Atlantic 401(k) Plan through a rollover contribution into a defined
contribution retirement plan with a 401(k) feature of Ameris or its
Subsidiaries (the " _Ameris 401(k) Plan_ "), if such employees are Atlantic
Continuing Employees, or to transfer the amount credited to their accounts
through an eligible rollover contribution to a separate third-
party individual retirement account (after the deemed distribution of any
participant loans as reflected in such accounts), or to take a cash
distribution from the Atlantic 401(k) Plan (after the deemed distribution of
any participant loans as reflected in such accounts), provided that: (i)
Atlantic's board of directors shall adopt resolutions to terminate the
Atlantic 401(k) Plan and cease all further deferrals with respect to eligible
compensation no later than the Business Day immediately prior to the
Closing Date; and (ii) the foregoing shall be subject to the receipt of a
final favorable IRS determination letter (or prototype sponsor letter) with
respect to the Atlantic 401(k) Plan to the extent reasonably required by
Ameris and completion of such other actions as may be required by applicable
legal requirements. For purposes of any vesting determinations (but not
benefit accruals) in connection with the Ameris 401(k) Plan in which any
Atlantic Continuing Employees may participate after the Closing Date, service
with Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date shall be
counted to the extent such service was counted under the Atlantic 401(k)
Plan. For purposes of eligibility to participate in any matching contribution
under the Ameris 401(k) Plan, Atlantic Continuing Employees shall be eligible
on terms and conditions consistent with those then currently provided by
Ameris to its other similarly-situated employees as of their employment date
with Ameris or any of its Subsidiaries. Prior to the Closing Date, Atlantic
shall make any necessary employer contributions to the Atlantic 401(k) Plan
due such Atlantic Continuing Employees for compensation paid by
Atlantic prior to termination of the Atlantic 401(k) Plan.

(c) Subject to applicable legal requirements, Ameris and Atlantic
shall take such other commercially reasonable actions prior to the
Closing Date as may be necessary to terminate or amend the agreements as so
designated (and with respect to an amendment, in the manner specified) on
_Section 2.28(a) of the Disclosure Schedule_ effective as of the Closing Date
and any other Atlantic Plans that Ameris directs Atlantic or Atlantic Coast
Bank to terminate or amend prior to the Closing. In connection with such
terminations, any compensation to be provided thereunder shall be paid in
full in exchange for a settlement and release agreement in a form
reasonably acceptable to Ameris to the extent requested by Ameris. Atlantic
shall: (i) permit Ameris to review, comment on and approve in advance any
documents or notices required to effect any of the foregoing; and (ii) provide
to Ameris prior to the Closing written evidence as to satisfaction of the
requirements of this _Section 5.10(c)_ as Ameris may reasonably request.
Unless terminated prior to Closing pursuant to this _Section 5.10(c)_ ,
Ameris shall honor any existing employment agreements with any
Atlantic Continuing Employees in accordance with their terms or as otherwise
amended by the parties.

  



  

(d) The Atlantic ESOP shall be terminated immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _ESOP Termination Date_ "). On the ESOP Termination
Date, Atlantic shall direct the Atlantic ESOP trustee to remit to Atlantic a
sufficient number of shares of Atlantic Common Stock held by the Atlantic
ESOP's unallocated suspense account to repay in full the outstanding balance
of the loan between the Atlantic ESOP and Atlantic (the " _Atlantic ESOP
Loan_ ") (with such Atlantic Common Stock valued as of the ESOP Termination
Date). If after remitting all such unallocated shares there remains any unpaid
amount outstanding under the Atlantic ESOP Loan, such unpaid amount,
including any unpaid but accrued interest, shall be forgiven by Atlantic at
the Effective Time. All remaining shares of Atlantic Common Stock held by the
Atlantic ESOP as of the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. Within thirty (30) days following the date
of this Agreement, Atlantic shall file or cause to be filed all necessary
documents with the IRS for a determination letter for termination of the
Atlantic ESOP. As soon as practicable following the receipt of a favorable
determination letter from the IRS regarding the qualified status of the
Atlantic ESOP upon its termination, the account balances in the Atlantic ESOP
shall either be distributed to participants and beneficiaries or transferred
to an eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or individual retirement account
as a participant or beneficiary may direct. Atlantic shall adopt such
amendments, board resolutions and other documentation as may be necessary
to effect the provisions of this _Section 5.10(d)_.

5.11 _Directors ' and Officers' Tail Coverage_. Prior to the Closing
Date, Ameris shall have, at Ameris's expense, amended, modified or obtained
directors' and officers' liability insurance (either through its existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies or under Atlantic's
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policies, in which
event Atlantic will designate Ameris's insurance broker as Atlantic's broker-
of-record, as determined by Ameris in its sole discretion) for a period of
six (6) years after the Closing Date, covering any person who is now, or has
been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing
Date, a director or officer of Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries, who are
currently covered by Atlantic's policies on terms similar to such existing
insurance; _provided_ , _however_ , that Ameris shall not be obligated to
make aggregate annual premium payments for such six (6)-year period in respect
of such policy which exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the annual premium
payments on Atlantic's current policy in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). If the amount of the premiums necessary
to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount,
then Ameris shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the most
advantageous policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. The directors and
officers of Atlantic and its Subsidiaries shall take all reasonable actions
required by the insurance carrier necessary to procure such endorsement.

  



  

5.12 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time (or, in
the case of Claims that have not been resolved prior to the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, until such Claims are finally
resolved), Ameris shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and
former directors and executive officers of Atlantic and each of its
Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against all liabilities
arising out of, resulting from or related to any claim, action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or other legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (each, a " _Claim_ "), in which an
Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party or witness arising
out of the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer
of Atlantic or any of its Subsidiaries (or, at Atlantic's request, was a
director, officer, manager or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with,
another Atlantic entity or Atlantic Plan) prior to the Effective Time if such
Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring on or
prior to the Effective Time (including the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is
asserted or claimed before, or after, the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law. Ameris shall promptly pay
reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in advance of the
final disposition of any such Claim to each Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law upon receipt of an undertaking to repay
such advance payments if he or she shall be adjudicated not to be entitled to
indemnification under this _Section 5.12(a)_. Ameris shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a federal or state
banking agency or other Governmental Authority shall determine that
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by Applicable Law (including any Law promulgated, interpreted or
enforced by any federal or state banking agency or other Governmental
Authority).

  



    

 | 46| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
_Section 5.12(a)_ , upon learning of any such Claim, shall promptly notify
Ameris thereof in writing (provided that a failure to timely provide such
notice shall not relieve Ameris of any indemnification obligation unless, and
to the extent that, Ameris is materially prejudiced by such failure). In the
event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective Time):
(i) Ameris shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Ameris shall
not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Ameris elects
not to assume such defense for the Indemnified Parties, or if there are
substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest between Ameris and the
Indemnified Parties, then the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and Ameris shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are
received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Ameris shall be obligated pursuant to
this _Section 5.12(b)_ to pay for only one firm of counsel for any Indemnified
Party in any jurisdiction; (ii) each Indemnified Party will cooperate in good
faith in the defense of any such Claim; (iii) Ameris shall not be liable for
any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); and (iv) without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
Ameris shall not agree to any settlement which does not provide for a release
of the Indemnified Party.

  



  

(c) Ameris covenants and agrees that neither it, nor any successors
or assigns, shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person
where Ameris or any such successor or assign shall not be the continuing or
surviving Person of such consolidation or merger, or transfer all or
substantially all of its assets to any Person, unless, in each case, proper
provision shall have been made to ensure that the successors and assigns of
Ameris shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.12_.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.12_ are intended to be for the
benefit of and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and their
respective heirs and legal and personal representatives.

  



  

5.13 _Certain Litigation_. Each party shall promptly advise the
other party orally and in writing of any actual or threatened
stockholder litigation against such party or the members of such party's
board of directors related to this Agreement or the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Atlantic shall: (a) permit Ameris
to review and discuss in advance, and shall consider in good faith the view
of Ameris in connection with, any proposed written or oral response to such
stockholder litigation; (b) furnish Ameris's outside legal counsel with all
non-privileged information and documents which outside legal counsel may
reasonably request in connection with such stockholder litigation; (c) consult
with Ameris regarding the defense or settlement of any such stockholder
litigation; and (d) not settle any such litigation prior to such consultation
and consideration; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Atlantic shall not settle
any such stockholder litigation if such settlement requires the payment of
money damages without the written consent of Ameris (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld) unless the payment of any such damages by Atlantic is
reasonably expected by Atlantic, following consultation with outside counsel,
to be fully covered (disregarding any deductible to be paid by Atlantic)
under Atlantic's existing director and officer insurance policies, including
any tail policy.

5.14 _Information Systems Conversion_. From and after the date
hereof, Ameris and Atlantic shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to facilitate the integration of Atlantic with the business of Ameris
following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall meet
on a regular basis to discuss and plan for the conversion of the
telecommunications, data processing and related electronic information
systems of Atlantic and each of its Subsidiaries (the " _Information Systems
Conversion_ ") to those used by Ameris, which planning shall include the
following: (a) discussion of third-party service provider arrangements of
Atlantic and each of its Subsidiaries; (b) non-renewal or changeover, after
the Effective Time, of personal property leases and software licenses used by
Atlantic and any of its Subsidiaries in connection with their systems
operations; (c) retention of outside consultants and additional employees to
assist with such conversion; (d) outsourcing, as appropriate after the
Effective Time, of proprietary or self-provided system services; and (e) any
other actions necessary and appropriate to facilitate such conversion, as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time. Ameris shall promptly
reimburse Atlantic on request for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
fees, expenses or charges that Atlantic may incur as a result of taking, at
the request of Ameris, any action prior to the Effective Time to facilitate
the Information Systems Conversion.

  



  

5.15 _No Control of Other Party 's Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Ameris, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of Atlantic or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Atlantic,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of
Ameris or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of Atlantic and Ameris shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, control and supervision over its
and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

  



  

5.16 _Director Resignations_. Atlantic shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Ameris resignations, to

_Section 7.5_.

  



    

 | 51| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) This Agreement may be terminated at any time on or prior to the
Closing Date by Atlantic upon written notice to Ameris: (i) if the

7.7 _Acquisition Proposal_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement may be terminated by Atlantic upon written
notice to Ameris, if, prior to obtaining the Requisite Atlantic
Stockholder Approval: (i) the board of directors of Atlantic shall have
effected an Adverse Recommendation Change; and (ii) Atlantic has
complied with the requirements of _Section 4.19_ and _Section 5.2_.

Agreement other than pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_  or _Section 7.2(b)_ ; or

equal to $5,750,000, which shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Ameris
for all claims under this Agreement based upon, resulting from or arising out

7.8 _Ameris Stock Price Decline_. This Agreement may be terminated
by Atlantic, at any time during the four (4) Business Day period immediately
following the Determination Date, if both of the following conditions are
satisfied:

  



  

(a) the quotient obtained by dividing the Average Ameris Stock
Price by the Starting Price (such quotient being the " _Ameris Ratio_
") shall be less than 0.85; and

  



  

(b) the Ameris Ratio shall be less than eighty-five percent (85%)
of the quotient of (i) the Average Index Price divided by (ii) the
Index Price on the Starting Date (such quotient being the " _Index Ratio_ ");

  

 _ _

  

 _The following examples are provided only for purposes of illustrating the
foregoing conditions:_

  

 _ _

  

 _ _Example 1_ : If the Ameris Ratio = 0.80 and the Index Ratio = 0.90, then
85% of the Index Ratio would be 0.85 x 0.90, or 76.5%, and condition 7.8(a)
above would be satisfied, but condition 7.8(b) above would not be satisfied._

  

 _ _

  

 _ _Example 2_ : If the Ameris Ratio = 0.70 and the Index Ratio = 0.84, then
85% of the Index Ratio would be 0.85 x 0.84, or 71.4%, and both conditions
7.8(a) and 7.8(b) above would be satisfied._

  



  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that if Atlantic refuses to consummate the Merger
pursuant to this _Section 7.8_ , then it shall give prompt written
notice thereof to Ameris (and provided that such Atlantic notice of election
to terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned four (4)
Business Day period). During the three (3) Business Day period commencing with
its receipt of such notice, Ameris shall have the option to increase the
consideration to be received by the holders of Atlantic Common Stock hereunder
by either:

  



    

 | 53| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) increasing the Exchange Ratio (calculated to the nearest one
one-thousandth); or

  



  

(ii) provided that it does not, and will not, prevent or impede the
Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, paying, as part of the Merger Consideration, to each
recipient of the Per Share Purchase Price, a cash payment (in addition to,
and not in lieu of, issuing the Per Share Purchase Price to such recipients in
accordance with this Agreement) (such cash payment, the " _Additional Cash
Consideration_ ");

  



  

in each case of the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii), such that the
value of the consideration (calculated based on the Average Ameris Stock
Price and including any Additional Cash Consideration) to be received by each
holder of Atlantic Common Stock hereunder, exclusive of Cash Consideration,
equals the lesser of the following: (A) an amount equal to the product of the
Starting Price, 0.85 and the Exchange Ratio (as in effect immediately prior
to any increase in the Exchange Ratio pursuant to this _Section 7.8_ ); and
(B) an amount equal to (1) the product of the Index Ratio, 0.85, the Exchange
Ratio (as in effect immediately prior to any increase in the Exchange Ratio
pursuant to this _Section 7.8_ ) and the Average Ameris Stock Price, divided
by (2) the Ameris Ratio.

  



  

If Ameris so elects within such three (3) Business Day period, then it shall
give prompt written notice to Atlantic of such election and the
revised Exchange Ratio or the Additional Cash Consideration, as applicable,
whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this  _Section 7.8_
and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms,
provided that any references in this Agreement to the "Exchange Ratio" shall
thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio as increased pursuant
to this _Section 7.8_ , if applicable, and any references in this Agreement
to the Per Share Stock Purchase Price shall thereafter include the Additional
Cash Consideration as set forth in this _Section 7.8_ , if applicable.

prices of Ameris Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ during the twenty

_however_ , that in the event Ameris Common Stock does not trade on any one or
more of the trading days during the twenty (20) consecutive full trading days
ending at the closing of trading on the trading day immediately prior to the
Determination Date, any such date shall be disregarded in computing the
average closing sales price and the average shall be based upon the closing
sales prices and number of days on which Ameris Common Stock actually traded
during the twenty (20) consecutive full trading days ending at the closing of
trading on the trading day immediately prior to the Determination Date.

  



  

" _Average Index Price_ " shall mean the average of the daily current market
prices of the Index for the twenty (20) consecutive full trading days ending

---|---|---

consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  



  

8.11 _Cumulative Remedies; Specific Performance_. All rights and
remedies under this Agreement or otherwise afforded by Applicable Law to any
party shall be cumulative and not alternative. Without limiting the rights of
a party hereto to pursue all other legal and equitable rights available to
such party for another party's failure to perform its obligations under this
Agreement, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law
for any failure to perform their respective obligations hereunder would be
inadequate and that each party shall be entitled to specific performance,
injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in the event of any such
failure. Each of the parties hereby further waives any requirement under
Applicable Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief.

WITNESSETH:

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as the

the date hereof and to be executed by Ameris and Atlantic concurrently with
the execution of this Agreement by the parties hereto, Atlantic will, subject

with Ameris being the surviving entity (the " _Merger_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, as an inducement for Ameris to enter into the Merger Agreement,
Ameris has required that each Stockholder enter into this Agreement;

The effectiveness of this Agreement shall be conditioned upon the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by the parties thereto.

  



  

3. _Voting Agreement_.

  



  

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of (x) the Effective
Time and (y) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its
terms (the " _Support Period_ "), each Stockholder irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that at any stockholder meeting of Atlantic to approve
the Merger Agreement or any adjournment or postponement thereof, such
Stockholder shall be present (in person or by proxy) and shall vote (or cause
to be voted) all shares of Atlantic Common Stock beneficially owned by such
Stockholder as of the date hereof, together with all shares of Atlantic
Common Stock over which such Stockholder may acquire beneficial
ownership from time to time after the date hereof, in each case that are
entitled to vote at such meeting (collectively, the " _Owned Shares_ "), as
follows:

  



    



 



    



  

(i) in favor of (A) the approval or adoption of the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby (including any amendments or
modifications of the terms thereof approved by the board of directors of
Atlantic and adopted in accordance with the terms thereof) and (B) the
approval of any proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting to a later date
if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Merger Agreement; and

  



  

(ii) against (A) any action or agreement that would be reasonably
likely to impair the ability of either Ameris or Atlantic to complete
the Merger, or that would otherwise be inconsistent with, prevent, impede or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, and (B) other than the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, any proposal that relates to an Acquisition Proposal, without
regard to the terms of such proposal.

  



  

(b) Each Stockholder further agrees not to vote or execute any
written consent to rescind or amend in any manner any prior vote or
written consent, as a stockholder of Atlantic, to approve or adopt the Merger
Agreement unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
its terms.

  



  

(c) Each Stockholder represents and warrants and covenants and
agrees that, except for this Agreement, such Stockholder (i) has not
entered into, and shall not enter into during the Support Period, any voting
agreement or voting trust with respect to the Owned Shares and (ii) has not
granted, and shall not grant during the Support Period, a proxy, consent or
power of attorney with respect to the Owned Shares except any proxy to carry
out the intent of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) With respect to any Stockholder that is an officer, director or
other representative of Atlantic or any of Subsidiary of Atlantic,
such Stockholder, in its capacity as a stockholder of Atlantic, hereby

During the Support Period, each Stockholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally grants to, and appoints, Ameris and any designee thereof as such Stockholder's proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of such Stockholder, to vote or cause to be voted (including by proxy or written consent, if applicable) the Owned Shares owned by such Stockholder as of the applicable record date in accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that each Stockholder's grant of the proxy contemplated by this Section 4 shall be effective if, and only if, such Stockholder has not delivered to Atlantic prior to the meeting at which any of the matters described in Section 3 are to be considered, a duly executed irrevocable proxy card directing that the Owned Shares of such Stockholder be voted in accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement. Each Stockholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this Section 4, if it becomes effective, is coupled with an interest and is given in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance of the duties of such Stockholder under this Agreement. The parties hereby further affirm that the irrevocable proxy, if it becomes effective, is intended to be irrevocable until the end of the Support Period, at which time it will terminate automatically. If for any reason any proxy granted herein is not irrevocable after it becomes effective, then the Stockholder granting such proxy agrees, until the end of the Support Period, to vote the Owned Shares in accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement. The parties agree that the foregoing is a voting agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this proxy shall automatically terminate and be revoked upon the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

Each Stockholder further agrees not to commence or participate in, and to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action with respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against Ameris, Atlantic or any of their respective Subsidiaries or successors relating to the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the Merger.

Each Stockholder further agrees that none of Ameris, Atlantic or any other person or entity shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 10, and each Stockholder irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. If any legal action or other proceeding is brought against any party hereto to enforce any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover all reasonable expenses relating thereto (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, court costs and expenses incident to arbitration, appellate and post-judgment proceedings) from the party against which such action or proceeding is brought, in addition to any other relief to which such prevailing party may be entitled.

  



  

11. _Governing Law and Enforceability; Venue_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, without giving effect to its principles of conflicts of laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Maryland General Corporation Law shall govern to the extent mandatorily applicable to Maryland corporations.

No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

WITNESSETH:

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Ameris and Atlantic
have determined that the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date
hereof, by and between Ameris and Atlantic (as the same may be amended or
supplemented, the " _Merger Agreement_ ") and the business combination and
related transactions contemplated thereby are in the best interests of their
respective entities and shareholders;

  



  

WHEREAS, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Atlantic will merge
with and into Ameris, with Ameris being the surviving entity (the " _Merger_
");

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties hereto acknowledge that Director, as a director of
Atlantic and/or Atlantic Coast Bank, occupies a unique position of trust and
confidence with respect to Atlantic and Atlantic Coast Bank, and is receiving
Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties further acknowledge that, by virtue of this position,
Director has acquired significant knowledge relating to the business of
Atlantic and Atlantic Coast Bank; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement contemplates that, upon the execution and
delivery of the Merger Agreement by Atlantic, as a condition and inducement
to the willingness of Ameris to enter into the Merger Agreement and complete
the Merger, Director will enter into and perform this Agreement;

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and for other good
and valuable consideration, including, without limitation, the Merger
Consideration to be received by Director, the sufficiency and receipt of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound,
agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Certain Definitions_. 

  



  

(a) " _Affiliated Company_ " means any company or entity
controlled by, controlling or under common control with Ameris or Atlantic,
including Ameris Bank and Atlantic Coast Bank.

  



    



 



    



  

(b) " _Confidential Information_ " means all information regarding
Atlantic, Ameris and their Affiliated Companies and any of their
respective activities, businesses or customers that is not generally known to
persons not employed (whether as employees or independent contractors) by
Atlantic, Ameris or their respective Affiliated Companies, that is not
generally disclosed publicly to persons not employed by Atlantic, Ameris or
their respective Affiliated Companies (except to their regulatory authorities
and pursuant to confidential or other relationships where there is no
expectation of public disclosure or use by third Persons), and that is the
subject of reasonable efforts to keep it confidential, and/or where such
information is subject to limitations on disclosure or use by Applicable Law.
" _Confidential Information_ " shall include, without limitation, all customer
information, customer lists, confidential methods of operation, lending and
credit information, commissions, mark-ups, product/service formulas,
information concerning techniques for use and integration of websites and
other products/services, current and future development and expansion or
contraction plans of Atlantic, Ameris or their respective Affiliated
Companies, sale/acquisition plans and contacts, marketing plans and contacts,
information concerning the legal affairs of Atlantic, Ameris or their
respective Affiliated Companies, and information concerning the pricing of
products and services, strategy, tactics and financial affairs of Atlantic,
Ameris or their respective Affiliated Companies. " _Confidential Information_
" also includes any "confidential information," "trade secrets" or any
equivalent term under any other Applicable Law. " _Confidential Information_
" shall not include information that (i) has become generally available to
the public other than as a result of Director's breach of this Agreement,
(ii) is obtained by Director from one who has the right to disclose such
information without violating any right or privilege of Atlantic or Ameris or
their respective Affiliated Companies or any duty owed to any of them, (iii)
was rightfully in the possession of a Person prior to receipt of such

independently developed by a Person without reference to or use of
Confidential Information.

  



  

(c) Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement have the
respective meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

2. _Nondisclosure of Confidential Information_. 

  



  

(a) Director agrees (i) to hold Confidential Information in
strictest confidence and (ii) except as required by Law, not to use,
duplicate, reproduce, distribute, disclose or otherwise disseminate
Confidential Information or any physical embodiments thereof and may in no
event take any action causing any Confidential Information to lose its
character or cease to qualify as Confidential Information, or fail to take
any action necessary in order to prevent any Confidential Information from
losing its character or ceasing to qualify as Confidential Information. In
the event that Director is required by Law to disclose any Confidential
Information, Director will not make such disclosure unless (and then only to
the extent that) prior written notice is given to Ameris when Director
becomes aware that such disclosure has been requested and is required by Law.
Director also acknowledges and agrees that trading in Ameris or Atlantic
securities using non-public information may violate federal and state
securities Laws and agrees to comply with such securities Laws and Ameris's
policies regarding insider trading in effect from time to time. The
obligations under this Section 2(a) shall remain in effect for two (2) years
from the Effective Time.

  



    

2

 



    



  

(b) Director and Ameris agree that Director's obligations under
these nondisclosure covenants are separate and distinct from other
provisions of this Agreement, and a failure or alleged failure of Atlantic
and Ameris to perform their obligations under any provision of this Agreement
or other agreements with Director shall not constitute a defense to, or waiver
of the enforceability of, these nondisclosure covenants. Nothing in this
provision or this Agreement shall limit any rights or remedies otherwise
available to Atlantic, Ameris or any Affiliated Company under Applicable Law.

  



  

3. _Nonrecruitment and Nonsolicitation Covenants_. 

  



  

(a) Director hereby agrees that for one (1) year following the
Effective Time, Director shall not, without the prior written consent of
Ameris, directly or indirectly, on behalf of himself or any other Person,
solicit, recruit or hire any employee of Ameris or any of Ameris's Affiliated
Companies who was an employee of Atlantic or Atlantic Coast Bank during
Director's service as a director of Atlantic or Atlantic Coast Bank;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 3(a) shall not apply with respect
to any person who does not become an employee of Ameris or any of its
Affiliated Companies upon consummation of the Merger (so long as any
such person did not decline an offer of employment with Ameris or any of its
Affiliated Companies upon the solicitation of, or recruitment by, Director).
Nothing in this Section 3(a) is intended to prohibit general advertising or
generally solicitation not specifically directed at employees of Ameris or
any of Ameris's Affiliated Companies.

  



  

(b) Director hereby agrees that for one (1) year following the
Effective Time, Director shall not, without the prior written consent
of Ameris, directly or indirectly, on behalf of himself or any other Person,
solicit or attempt to solicit for the purpose of providing any Business
Activities (as hereinafter defined) any customer of Atlantic, Ameris or any of
their Affiliated Companies, in each case, with whom Director had material
contact on behalf of Atlantic or Atlantic Coast Bank in the course of
Director's service as a director of Atlantic or Atlantic Coast Bank. For
purposes of this Section 3(b), " _Business Activities_ " shall be any of the
business activities conducted by Ameris, Atlantic or any of their Affiliated
Companies as of the Effective Time, which the parties agree are the offering
of commercial or consumer loans and extensions of credit, letters of credit,

agreements and sweep accounts, cash management services, money transfer and
bill payment services, payroll services, insurance brokerage services,
investment advisory and management services, internet or electronic banking,
automated teller machines, IRA and retirement accounts, mortgage loans and
home equity lines of credit.

  



  

(c) Director acknowledges that the term and scope of the covenants
set forth in this Agreement are reasonable and agrees that he will not,
in any action, suit or other proceeding, deny the reasonableness of, or
assert the unreasonableness of, the premises, consideration or scope of the
covenants set forth herein. Director and Ameris agree that Director's
obligations under the above covenants are separate and distinct under this
Agreement, and the failure or alleged failure of Ameris to perform its
obligations under any other provisions of this Agreement shall not constitute
a defense to the enforceability of this covenant. Director and Ameris
agree that if any portion of the foregoing covenants is deemed to be
unenforceable because the time or scope of activities restricted is deemed to
be too broad, then the court shall be authorized to substitute for the
overbroad term an enforceable term that will enable the enforcement of the
covenants to the maximum extent possible under Applicable Law. Director
acknowledges and agrees that any breach or threatened breach of this covenant
will result in irreparable damage and injury to Ameris and its Affiliated
Companies and that Ameris will be entitled to exercise all rights, including,
without limitation, obtaining one or more temporary restraining orders,
injunctive relief and other equitable relief, including specific performance
in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, in any
federal or state court of competent jurisdiction, and to exercise all other
rights or remedies, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, the
right to damages.

4. _Successors_. This Agreement is personal to Director and is not assignable by Director, and none of Director's duties hereunder may be delegated. This Agreement may be assigned by, and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of, Ameris and any of its Affiliated Companies and their successors and assigns.

  



  

5. _Waiver_. Failure of any party to insist, in one or more instances, on performance by the other in strict accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of any right granted in this Agreement or of the future performance of any such term or condition or of any other term or condition of this Agreement, unless such waiver is contained in a writing signed by the party making the waiver.

  



  

6. _Severability_. If any provision or covenant, or any part thereof, of this Agreement should be held by any court to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, either in whole or in part, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions or covenants, or any part thereof, of this Agreement, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.

  



  

7.   _Governing Law; Venue_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, without giving effect to its principles of conflicts of laws. Venue for any action hereunder shall lie exclusively in the Federal or State Courts located in Duval County, Florida.

(c) Executive hereby agrees that for six (6) months following the
Effective Time, Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of
Ameris, engage or participate in, or prepare or apply to commence, any
Business Activities with, for or on behalf of any financial institution as a
director, consultant, officer, employee, agent or shareholder, or on behalf of
any other Person that competes in the Restricted Area (as hereinafter

Atlantic Coast Bank as a result of the acquisition of Atlantic by Ameris.
Executive acknowledges that the term, geographic area and scope of the
covenants set forth in this Agreement are reasonable and agrees that he will

provisions contained in this Agreement will not preclude him from engaging in
a lawful profession, trade or business, or from becoming gainfully employed.
Executive and Ameris agree that Executive's obligations under the above
covenants are separate and distinct under this Agreement, and the failure or
alleged failure of Ameris to perform its obligations under any other
provisions of this Agreement shall not constitute a defense to the
enforceability of this covenant. Executive and Ameris agree that if any
portion of the foregoing covenants is deemed to be unenforceable because the
geography, time or scope of activities restricted is deemed to be too broad,
then the court shall be authorized to substitute for the overbroad term an
enforceable term that will enable the enforcement of the covenants to
the maximum extent possible under Applicable Law. Executive acknowledges and
agrees that any breach or threatened breach of this covenant will result in
irreparable damage and injury to Ameris and its Affiliated Companies and that
Ameris will be entitled to exercise all rights, including, without

relief and other equitable relief, including specific performance in the
event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, in any federal or
state court of competent jurisdiction, and to exercise all other rights or
remedies, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, the right to
damages.

16. _Successors_. This Agreement is personal to Executive and is not assignable by Executive, and none of Executive's duties hereunder may be delegated. This Agreement may be assigned by, and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of, Ameris and any of its Affiliated Companies and their successors and assigns.

  



  

17. _Waiver_. Failure of any party to insist, in one or more instances, on performance by the other in strict accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of any right granted in this Agreement or of the future performance of any such term or condition or of any other term or condition of this Agreement, unless such waiver is contained in a writing signed by the party making the waiver.

  



  

18. _Severability_. If any provision or covenant, or any part thereof, of this Agreement should be held by any court to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, either in whole or in part, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions or covenants, or any part thereof, of this Agreement, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.
