entitled prior to the Cut-Off Date and excluding the effects or proceeds of
any Hedges);

(ii) increased by an amount equal to the amount of all Property Costs and all
other costs and expenses which are incurred by or on behalf of Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller in connection with the ownership and operation of the
Assets from and after the Effective Time, excluding in each case (A) any
costs already deducted in the determination of proceeds in _Section 2.4(_ _i_

Purchase Price, as adjusted, the " _Adjusted Stock Purchase Price_ "), or any
combination thereof. For purposes of adjustments to the Stock Purchase Price
or the Adjusted Stock Purchase Price, as applicable, each share of Common
Stock shall be valued at the Share Price.

 



-32- Section 2.5 _Closing Consideration and Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(a) Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, a draft preliminary settlement
statement (the " __ _Preliminary Settlement Statement_ __") setting forth (i)
Sellers good faith estimate of the Adjusted Purchase Price for the Assets as
of the Closing Date after giving effect to all adjustments set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_, (ii) the Persons, accounts, and amounts of disbursements
that Seller designates and nominates to receive the Cash Closing Payment and

Seller shall supply to Purchaser reasonable documentation in the possession
of Seller or any of its Affiliates to support the items for which adjustments
are proposed or made in the Preliminary Settlement Statement delivered by
Seller and a brief explanation of any such adjustments and the reasons
therefor. Within three (3) Business Days after receipt of Sellers draft
Preliminary Settlement Statement, Purchaser will deliver to Seller a written
report containing all changes that Purchaser proposes to be made to the
Preliminary Settlement Statement, if any, together with a brief explanation
of any such changes. The Preliminary Settlement Statement, as agreed upon by
the Parties, will be used to adjust the Unadjusted Purchase Price at Closing;
_provided_ that if the Parties cannot agree on all adjustments set forth in
the Preliminary Settlement Statement prior to the Closing, then any
adjustments as set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement as presented
by Seller will be used to adjust the Unadjusted Purchase Price at Closing.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, but not later than
the later of (i) the one hundred and eightieth (180th) day following the
Closing Date and (ii) five (5) Business Days after the date on which the
Parties or the applicable Defect Referee finally determines all Defect Amounts
under _Section 3.2(_ _i_ _)_ , Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser

documentation available to support the final figures. As soon as reasonably
practicable, but not later than the fifteenth (15th) day following receipt of
Sellers statement hereunder, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a written
report containing any changes that Purchaser proposes be made in such
statement. Any changes not so specified in such written report shall be deemed
waived and Sellers determinations with respect to all such elements of the
final settlement statement that are not addressed specifically in such report
shall prevail. If Purchaser fails to timely deliver a written report to Seller
containing changes Purchaser proposes to be made to the final settlement
statement, the final settlement statement as delivered by Seller will be
deemed to be correct and mutually agreed upon by the Parties, and will be
final and binding on the Parties and not subject to further audit or
arbitration. Seller may deliver a written report to Purchaser during the same
fifteen (15) day period reflecting any changes that Seller proposes to be made
in such statement as a result of additional information received after the
statement was prepared. The Parties shall undertake to agree on the final
statement of the Adjusted Purchase Price no later than thirty (30) days
following Purchasers receipt of Sellers statement delivered hereunder.
In the event that the Parties cannot reach agreement as to the final
statement of the Adjusted Purchase Price within such period of time, either
Party may refer the items of adjustment which are in dispute or the
interpretation or effect of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ to a nationally-
recognized independent accounting firm or consulting firm mutually acceptable
to both Purchaser and Seller (the " __ _Accounting Referee_ __"), for review
and final determination by arbitration. The Accounting Referee shall conduct
the

Arbitration Rules of the AAA, to the extent such rules do not conflict with
the terms of this _Section 2.5(b)_. The Accounting Referees determination
shall be made within fifteen (15) days after submission of the matters in
dispute and, without limiting the application of _Section 10.1(c)_ or
Purchasers right to indemnity under _Section 12.3(c)_ for Seller Taxes,
shall be final and binding on all Parties, without right of appeal. In
rendering its award, the Accounting Referee shall be limited to selecting
either Sellers position or Purchasers position as submitted by the Parties
to the Accounting Referee. The Accounting Referee shall act as an expert for
the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed aspects of Adjusted
Purchase Price adjustments submitted by any Party and may not award
damages, interest (except to the extent expressly provided for in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_), or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter.
Seller and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case. Seller and Purchaser shall each bear one-half of the
fees, costs, and expenses of the Accounting Referee. The final Adjusted
Purchase Price (the " __ _Final Purchase Price_ __") shall be determined

Purchasers fifteen (15) day review period without delivery of any written
report or (ii) the date on which the Parties or the Accounting Referee
finally determine the Adjusted Purchase Price.

(c) On the Cut-Off Date, (i) in the event the Final Purchase Price exceeds
the sum of the Cash Closing Payment _plus_ the Deposit _plus_ the product of
the Share Price multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock comprising
the Stock Closing Consideration _plus_ the product of the Share Price
multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock comprising the Holdback
Shares, Purchaser Parent shall pay to Seller an amount equal to such excess,
which payment shall be made, at Sellers sole option, either (A) by delivery
to Seller of definitive stock certificates (bearing any required restrictive
legends), registered in the name of Purchaser, representing a number
of shares of Common Stock equal to such excess _divided by_ the Share Price,
(B) by payment to Seller of an amount of cash equal to such excess, or (C)
through any combination of the foregoing, or (ii) in the event the sum of
the Cash Closing Payment _plus_ the Deposit _plus_ the product of the Share
Price multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock comprising the Stock
Closing Consideration _plus_ the product of the Share Price multiplied by the
number of shares of Common Stock comprising the Holdback Shares exceeds the
Final Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to such
excess, which payment shall be made, at Sellers sole option, either (A) by
forfeiting to Purchaser Parent the number of Common Stock equal to the
quotient (rounded to the nearest whole share) amount of such excess _divided
by_ the Share Price, (B) by paying to Purchaser an amount of cash equal to
such excess or (C) through any combination of the foregoing.

the Cut-Off Date.

 

(iii) Except amounts for which the Unadjusted Purchase Price was adjusted
under _Section 2.4(h)(i)_ , Purchaser shall be entitled to all Hydrocarbons
produced from, or attributable to, the Oil and Gas Properties from and after
the Effective Time.

(iv) Purchaser shall pay and be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds
and indemnities with respect to) (1) all Property Costs incurred from and
after the Effective Time, (2) except amounts for which the Unadjusted Purchase
Price was adjusted under  _Section 2.4(k)_ , all Property Costs and all other
costs and expense of Seller and its Affiliates which are incurred in
connection with the all Purchase Benefit Operations, and (3) all costs
described in _Section 2.6(a)(ii)_ once Sellers responsibility for the same
terminates on the Cut-Off Date.

(b) Without duplication of any adjustments made pursuant to _Section 2.4(i)_
, (i) should Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser receive after Closing any
proceeds or other income to which Seller is entitled under _Section 2.6(a)_ ,
Purchaser shall fully disclose, account for, and promptly remit the same to
Seller and (ii) should Seller or any Affiliate of Seller receive after Closing
any proceeds or other income to which Purchaser is entitled under _Section
2.6(a)_ , Seller shall fully disclose, account for, and promptly remit the
same to Purchaser.

(c) Without duplication of any adjustments made pursuant to _Section 2.4(i)_
, (i) should Purchaser, or any Affiliate of Purchaser, pay after Closing any
Property Costs for which Seller is responsible under _Section 2.6(a)_ ,
Purchaser shall be reimbursed by Seller promptly after receipt of Purchasers

proof of payment and (ii) should Seller, or any Affiliate of Seller, pay after
Closing but before the Cut-Off Date any Property Costs for which Purchaser is
responsible under _Section 2.6(a)_ , Seller shall be reimbursed by Purchaser
promptly after receipt of Sellers invoice, accompanied by copies of the
relevant vendor or other invoice and proof of payment.

 



-35- (d) Seller shall have no further responsibility for Property Costs incurred
with respect to the Assets for which Seller otherwise would be responsible
under _Section 2.6(a)_ to the extent such amounts have not been paid on or
before the Cut-Off Date.

 

Section 2.7 _Procedures_.

 

(a) All adjustments and payments made pursuant to this _Article 2_ shall be
without duplication of any other amounts paid, credited, debited, or received
under this Agreement.

(b) For purposes of allocating production (and accounts receivable with
respect thereto), under  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, (i)
liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Oil
and Gas Properties when they are produced into the tank batteries related
to each Well and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or
attributable to" the Oil and Gas Properties when they pass through the
delivery point sales meters or similar meters at the point of entry into the
pipelines through which they are transported. Seller shall use reasonable
interpolative procedures to arrive at an allocation of production when exact
meter readings, gauging, or strapping data are not available.

 

(c) Surface use or damage fees and other Property Costs that are paid
periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable
period falling before or on or after the Effective Time.

audits of Property Costs covering periods for which Seller is in whole or in
part responsible under _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, _provided_ that Seller shall not
agree to any adjustments to previously assessed costs for which Purchaser is
liable, or any compromise of any audit claims to which Purchaser would be
entitled, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld. Each Party shall provide the other Party with a copy
of all applicable audit reports and written audit agreements received by such
Party and relating to periods for which Seller is partially responsible.

 

(e) "Earned" and "incurred," as used in _Section 2.4(i)_ and _Section_ __ _
2.6_, shall be interpreted in accordance with accounting recognition guidance
under the Accounting Principles.

Section 2.8 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Purchaser and Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to agree to an allocation of the Adjusted
Purchase Price and any other items properly treated as consideration for U.S.
federal income tax purposes among the Assets in accordance with Section 1060
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder within thirty
(30) days after the Cut-Off Date (the " _Allocation_ "). If Seller and
Purchaser are unable to resolve any disagreement with respect to such
allocation, the Parties shall submit the dispute to the Accounting Referee
consistent with the procedures set forth in _Section 2.5(b)_ to resolve such
dispute. If Seller and Purchaser reach an agreement with respect to the
Allocation (or the Accounting Referee determines the Allocation), (a)
Purchaser and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to update the
Allocation in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code following any
adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to this

 



-36-  Agreement, (b) Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, report consistently with the Allocation, as adjusted, on all

ARTICLE 3

TITLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Section 3.1 _Title and Environmental Matters_.

 

(a) _General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations_. Subject to
_Section 3.1(b)_ and the special warranty of Defensible Title as set forth in
the Conveyances with respect to Sellers right, title, and interest in the Oil
and Gas Properties with an Allocated Value and any Additional Interests
conveyed thereunder and without limiting Purchasers remedies for Defects set
forth in this _Article 3_ or any Defect Indemnity Agreement delivered
hereunder, SELLER DOES NOT MAKE, AND PURCHASER, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH
MEMBER OF THE PURCHASER GROUP, HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES, AND DISCHARGES EACH
MEMBER OF THE SELLER GROUP FROM ANY AND ALL SUITS, LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, COSTS, LIABILITIES, LOSSES, INTEREST,
OR CAUSES OF ACTION WHATSOEVER, IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN,
ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANY PERIODS OF TIME WHICH ANY MEMBER OF THE PURCHASER GROUP
MIGHT NOW OR SUBSEQUENTLY MAY HAVE, BASED ON, RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF,
ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION OF ANY MEMBER OF THE SELLER GROUP, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO (I) SELLERS OR ANY
OTHER PERSONS TITLE TO, OR DEFICIENCY IN TITLE TO, ANY OF THE ASSETS, (II)
ANY MATTERS WITH RESPECT TO THE EXISTENCE OF ANY ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT,
ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, OR ANY
OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION WITH RESPECT TO THE OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION OF
ASSETS, OR (III) WHETHER SELLER OR ANY OF THE ASSETS (OR THE OWNERSHIP OR
OPERATION THEREOF) ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. Purchaser
hereby acknowledges and agrees that except as to any breach of the special
warranty of Defensible Title set forth in the Conveyances (which shall survive
in accordance with the terms of _Section 3.1(b)_ ) and the rights and remedies
set forth in any Defect Indemnity Agreement delivered hereunder, _Article 3_
sets forth Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy with respect to (A) any
Defect, (B) the failure of Seller or any other Person to have title to any of
the Assets (whether Defensible Title or otherwise), and (C) the existence of
any Environmental Defect, Environmental Liabilities, Release of Hazardous
Substances, or any other environmental condition with respect to the Assets.

 

(b) _Special Warranties of Title in the Conveyances_.

 

(i) The Conveyances delivered at Closing shall contain a special warranty of
Defensible Title by Seller whereby Seller warrants Defensible Title to
Sellers right, title, and interest in the Oil and Gas Properties with an
Allocated Value and Additional

 



-37-  Interests conveyed thereunder unto Purchaser against every Person whomsoever
lawfully claiming or to claim the same or any part thereof by, through, or
under Seller but not otherwise, subject however, to the Permitted
Encumbrances. The special warranties of Defensible Title contained in the
Conveyances and this _Section 3.1(b)_ shall be subject to the further
limitations and provisions of this _Article 3_ , _mutatis mutandis_ ,
including, however, the Individual Defect Threshold but excluding the Defect
Deductible.

(ii) As a condition to asserting a valid claim for breach of Sellers special
warranty of Defensible Title set forth in the Conveyances, no later than the
date nine (9) months after the Closing Date, Purchaser may furnish Seller a
Defect Notice meeting the requirements of  _Section 3.2(a)_ setting forth any
matters that Purchaser asserts as a breach of the special warranty of
Defensible Title set forth in the Conveyances. Seller shall have a reasonable
opportunity, but not the obligation, to cure prior to the date twelve (12)
months after the Closing Date any Title Defect asserted by Purchaser pursuant
to this _Section 3.1(b)_. Purchaser agrees to reasonably cooperate with any
attempt by Seller to cure any such Title Defect. Purchaser shall be deemed to
have waived all breaches of Sellers special warranty of Defensible Title set
forth in the Conveyances for which Seller has not received on or before the
date nine (9) months after the Closing Date a valid Defect Notice
that satisfies the requirements set forth in _Section 3.2(a)_.

(iii) For purposes of the special warranties of Defensible Title contained in
the Conveyances, the value of the Assets set forth in the exhibits thereto, as
applicable, shall be deemed to be the Allocated Value thereof, as adjusted
herein. Recovery on the special warranties of Defensible Title contained in
the Conveyances shall be limited to an amount (without any interest accruing
thereon) equal to the reduction to the Unadjusted Purchase Price to which
Purchaser would have been entitled had Purchaser asserted the Title Defect
giving rise to such breach of the special warranties of Defensible Title
contained in the Conveyances, as applicable, as a Title Defect prior to
Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, in each case after giving effect to
the application of the Individual Defect Threshold but without application of
the Defect Deductible.

Section 3.2 _Defects; Adjustments_.

 

(a) _Notice of Defects_. As a condition to Purchaser asserting any claim with
respect to any alleged Defect, Purchaser must deliver a valid Notice or
Notices (each a " _Defect Notice_ ") with respect to such alleged Defect to
Seller on or before 5:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on February 11, 2017 (the
" _Defect Deadline_ ");  _provided_ that Purchaser shall provide to Seller
weekly updates (which may be amended or supplemented by a Defect Notice)
regarding any Defects identified by or on behalf of Purchaser. In order to be
a valid Defect Notice as to each alleged Defect, each such notice shall be in
writing and must include:

(i) a description of the alleged Defect;

 

(ii) the Oil and Gas Property subject to such Defect;

 

(iii) the Allocated Value of each Oil and Gas Property subject to the alleged
Defect;

 



-38- (iv) Purchasers good faith reasonable estimate of the Defect Amount
attributable to such Defect and the computations and information upon which
Purchasers estimate is based;

(v) all Reasonable Documentation in Purchasers or Purchasers
Representatives possession or control supporting Purchasers assertion and
claim of such Defect; and

 

(vi) with respect to any Environmental Defect, reference to the specific
section of all applicable Laws that have been violated or that require
Remediation with respect to the applicable Assets as of the Effective Time.

SUBJECT TO PURCHASERS RIGHTS HEREUNDER WITH RESPECT TO BREACHES OF THE
SPECIAL WARRANTIES OF DEFENSIBLE TITLE SET FORTH IN THE CONVEYANCES,
PURCHASER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED AND RELEASED, AND COVENANTS THAT IT
SHALL WAIVE AND RELEASE, ANY AND ALL DEFECTS (AND ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO
THE UNADJUSTED PURCHASE PRICE ATTRIBUTABLE THERETO) FOR WHICH SELLER HAS NOT
RECEIVED ON OR BEFORE THE APPLICABLE DEFECT DEADLINE A VALID DEFECT
NOTICE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE
CONTRARY, AN ALLEGED FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH SUBSECTIONS __ _ SECTIONS
3.2(A)(V)_ AND  _3.2( A)(VI)_, ABOVE SHALL NOT CAUSE ANY SUCH NOTICE TO
BE INVALID OR ANY DEFECT TO BE WAIVED IF THE DEFECT NOTICE IS REASONABLY
SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE NOTICE TO SELLER OF THE EXISTENCE AND GENERAL NATURE OF
THE ALLEGED DEFECT.

(b)  _Notice of Title Benefits_. Should Seller discover any Title Benefit at
any time on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, Seller shall have the right, but not
the obligation, on or before Cut-Off Date, to deliver to Purchaser a written
notice (each a " __ _Title Benefit Notice_ __") including:

 

(i) a description of the alleged Title Benefit;

 

(ii) the Oil and Gas Properties subject to such Title Benefit;

 

(iii) the Allocated Value of each Oil and Gas Property subject to the alleged
Title Benefit;

 

(iv) Sellers good faith reasonable estimate of the Title Benefit Amount
attributable to such Title Benefit and the computations and information upon
which such Partys estimate is based; and

(v) all Reasonable Documentation in Sellers or its Representatives
possession or control supporting Sellers assertion and claim of the alleged
Title Benefit.

(c) _Option to Cure Defects_. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation to attempt, at Sellers sole cost, to cure or remove, on or prior
to the date ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, any Defects asserted in a
valid Defect Notice. Seller shall be deemed to have cured or removed a
validly asserted Defect on or prior to the Cut-Off Date if the Oil and Gas
Property affected by such alleged Defect is free of all Defects as of the
date ninety (90) days

 



-39-  after the Closing Date. If any validly asserted Defect is not cured or
removed as elected by Seller, or if Seller and Purchaser cannot agree as to
whether such Defect has been cured or removed, and it is determined by the
applicable Defect Referee that such Defect is not cured by the date ninety
(90) days after the Closing Date, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
adjusted by the Defect Amount attributable to such Defect. In the event that
any Defect that Seller elects to cure after the Closing is cured (or partially
cured) by the date ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, then, in the final
calculation of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ , the
Adjusted Purchase Price will be adjusted upward by the amount by which the
Unadjusted Purchase Price was adjusted downward at the Closing for such Defect
(or the portion of such downward adjustment attributable to the cured portion
of such affected Asset). Sellers attempt to cure or remove a Defect shall
not constitute an obligation to cure or attempt to cure such Defect or a
waiver of Sellers right to dispute the validity, nature, or value of, or cost
to cure, such Defect.

(d) _Defect Amounts_. The diminution of value of the Assets attributable to
any valid Defect that actually burdens, encumbers, or affects an Oil and Gas
Property (the " _Defect Amount_ ") shall be determined as follows:

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Defect Amount, that amount shall be
the Defect Amount;

(ii) if a Title Defect is a Lien that is liquidated in amount, then the
Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title
Defect from Sellers interest in the affected Oil and Gas Property;

 

(iii) if a Title Defect as to any Undeveloped Lease represents a negative
discrepancy between (A) the actual Net Revenue Interest for any such
Undeveloped Leases and (B) the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on
_Exhibit_ __ _ A-1_ for such Undeveloped Lease and if such negative
discrepancy is accompanied by a corresponding, proportionate decrease to the
Working Interests in such Subject Formation as to such Undeveloped Lease (or
the affected portions thereof), then the Defect Amount shall be equal to (1)
the product of the Net Mineral Acre Price thereof, _multiplied by_ (2) the
number of Net Fee Mineral Acres of such Undeveloped Lease subject to such
Title Defect _multiplied by_ (3) a fraction, the numerator of which is (x) the
remainder of (I) the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit_ __ _ A-1_ for
such Undeveloped Lease _minus_ (II) the actual Net Revenue Interest for such
Undeveloped Lease after giving effect to such Title Defect and the
denominator of which is (y) the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit_ __ _
A-1_ for such Undeveloped Lease; _provided_ that if the Title Defect does not
affect the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on _Exhibit_ __ _ A-1_
for such Undeveloped Lease throughout its entire productive life, the Defect
Amount determined under this _Section 3.2(d)(iii)_ shall be reduced to take
into account the applicable time period only;

(iv) if a Title Defect as to the Subject Formation affecting any Well
represents a negative discrepancy between (A) the actual Net Revenue Interest
for the Subject Formation as to such Well and (B) the "Net Revenue Interest"
percentage stated on _Exhibit A-3_ for such Well and if such negative
discrepancy is accompanied by a corresponding, proportionate decrease to the
Working Interests in such Subject Formation as to such Well, then the Defect
Amount shall be equal to the product of (1) the Allocated Value of such Well

 



-40-   _multiplied by_ (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is (x) the remainder
of (I) the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on _Exhibit A-3_ for such
Well _minus_ (II) the actual Net Revenue Interest as to the Subject Formation
as to such Well, and the denominator of which is (y) the "Net Revenue
Interest" percentage as to the Subject Formation stated on _Exhibit A-3_ as
to such Well; _provided_ that if the Title Defect does not affect the "Net
Revenue Interest" percentage as to the Subject Formation stated on _Exhibit
A-3_ for such Well throughout its entire productive life, the Defect Amount
determined under this _Section 3.2(d)(iv)_ shall be reduced to take into
account the applicable time period only;

(v) if a Title Defect as to any Fee Mineral Interest represents a negative
discrepancy between (A) the actual Net Revenue Interest for any such Fee
Mineral Interests and (B) the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on
_Exhibit_ __ _ A-2_ for such Fee Mineral Interest, then the Defect Amount
shall be equal to (1) the product of the Net Mineral Acre Price thereof,
_multiplied by_ (2) the number of Net Fee Mineral Acres of such Fee Mineral
Interest subject to such Title Defect _multiplied by_ (3) a fraction, the
numerator of which is (x) the remainder of (I) the Net Revenue Interest stated
in _Exhibit_ __ _ A-2_ for such Fee Mineral Interest _minus_ (II) the
actual Net Revenue Interest for such Fee Mineral Interest after giving effect
to such Title Defect and the denominator of which is (y) the Net Revenue
Interest stated in _Exhibit_ __ _ A-2_ for such Fee Mineral Interest;
_provided_ that if the Title Defect does not affect the "Net Revenue Interest"
percentage stated on _Exhibit_ __ _ A-2_ for such Fee Mineral
Interest throughout its entire productive life, the Defect Amount determined
under this _Section 3.2(d)(v)_ shall be reduced to take into account the
applicable time period only;

 

(vi) if a Title Defect represents a reduction in the number of Net Leasehold
Mineral Acres as to any Undeveloped Lease (or portion thereof) and the Net
Revenue Interest in such Undeveloped Lease after giving effect to such Title
Defect is equal to zero (0), then the Defect Amount for such Title Defect
shall be equal to the product of (1) the Net Mineral Acre Price allocated to
such Undeveloped Lease _multiplied by_ (2) the remainder of (x) the number of
Net Leasehold Mineral Acres purported to be included in such Undeveloped Lease
as set forth on  _Exhibit_ __ _ A-1_ _minus_ (y) the actual number of Net
Leasehold Mineral Acres included in such Undeveloped Lease after giving effect
to such Title Defect;

 

(vii) if a Title Defect represents a reduction in the number of Net Fee
Mineral Acres as to any Fee Mineral Interest (or portion thereof) and the Net
Revenue Interest in such Fee Mineral Interest after giving effect to such
Title Defect is equal to zero (0), then the Defect Amount for such Title
Defect shall be equal to the product of (1) the Net Mineral Acre Price
allocated to such Fee Mineral Interest _multiplied by_ (2) the remainder of
(x) the number of Net Fee Mineral Acres purported to be included in such Fee
Mineral Interest as set forth on  _Exhibit_ __ _ A-2_ _minus_ (y) the actual
number of Net Fee Mineral Acres included in such Fee Mineral Interest after
giving effect to such Title Defect;

 

(viii) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden, or
charge upon or other defect in title to the Subject Formation as to Oil and
Gas Property of a type not described in _Section 3.2(d)(_ _i_ _)_ through
_Section 3.2(d)(vii)_ , the Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into
account the Allocated Value of the Oil and Gas Property so affected, the
portion of Sellers interest in the Subject Formation as to such Oil and Gas
Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the potential

 



-41-  present value economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the
Subject Formation as to such Oil and Gas Property, the values placed upon the
Title Defect by Purchaser and Seller, the estimated capital and operational
costs and expenses (or reduction or increases thereof) attributable to
Sellers Working Interest, and such other factors as are necessary to make an
evaluation and determination of such value;

 

(ix) if a Defect is an Environmental Defect, the Defect Amount shall be equal
to the sum of (a) estimated present value as of the Closing Date (using a
discount factor of ten percent (10%) of the costs and expenses to Remediate
the Assets subject to such Environmental Defect in the most cost-effective
manner reasonably available, consistent with applicable Environmental Laws
taking into account that non-permanent remedies (including mechanisms to
contain or stabilize Hazardous Substances, including monitoring site
conditions, natural attenuation, risk-based corrective action, institutional
controls, or other appropriate restrictions on the industrial use of the
property, caps, dikes, encapsulation, leachate collection systems, and the
like) may be the most cost-effective manner reasonably available and, where
applicable, to the satisfaction of the applicable Governmental Authorities,
_plus_ (b) any actual fines, penalties, damages, or obligations imposed by any
Governmental Authority with respect to such Environmental Defect; _provided_
,  _however_ , such Defect Amount shall expressly exclude (A) the costs, fees
and expenses of Purchasers and/or its Affiliates employees or attorneys, (B)
costs, fees and expenses for matters that are ordinary costs of
doing business regardless of the presence of an Environmental Defect (e.g.,
those costs that would ordinarily be incurred in the day-to-day operations of
the Assets or in connection with Permit renewal/amendment activities), and
(C) overhead costs of Purchaser or its Affiliates;

(x) if a Defect is reasonably susceptible to being cured, the Defect Amount
with respect to any Defect shall in no event be greater than the amount that
can reasonably be shown to be the reasonably estimated present value
(discounted at a rate of ten percent (10%)) of lowest-cost response to cure
such Defect;

(xi) the Defect Amount with respect to a Defect shall be determined without
duplication of any costs or losses included in another Defect Amount
hereunder, or for which Purchaser otherwise receives credit in the calculation
of the Adjusted Purchase Price; _provided_ that, nothing herein shall prevent
Purchaser from asserting the same Defect against more than one Oil and Gas
Property if such Defect affects more than one Oil and Gas Property; and

(xii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
aggregate adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price for all Defect Amounts
attributable to Defects with respect to each Asset shall not, except in the
case of Environmental Defects, as necessary, exceed the Allocated Value of
such Asset (after giving effect to any applicable adjustments due to prior
Defects).

(e) _Title Benefit Amounts_. The " _Title Benefit Amount_ " for any Title
Benefit shall be determined as follows:

 



-42- (i) if a Title Benefit applicable to any Undeveloped Lease or Well represents
a positive discrepancy between (A) the actual Net Revenue Interest for such
Undeveloped Lease or Well and (B) the Net Revenue Interest percentage stated
on _Exhibit A-1_ for such Undeveloped Lease or  _Exhibit A-3_ for such Well,
then the Title Benefit Amount shall be equal to the product of (1) the
Allocated Value of such undeveloped Lease or Well _multiplied by_ (2) a
fraction, the numerator of which is (x) the actual Net Revenue Interest for
such Undeveloped Lease or Well, and the denominator of which is (y) the Net
Revenue Interest percentage stated on _Exhibit A-1_ for such Undeveloped
Lease or _Exhibit A-3_ for such Well; _provided_ that if the Title Benefit
does not affect the Net Revenue Interest percentage stated on _Exhibit  A-1_
for such Undeveloped Lease or _Exhibit A-3_ for such Well throughout its
entire productive life, the Title Benefit Amount determined under this
_Section 3.2(e)(i)_ shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time
period only;

(ii) if a Title Benefit constitutes an increase in the number of Net
Leasehold Mineral Acres as to any Undeveloped Lease (or portion thereof), then
the Title Benefit Amount for such Title Benefit shall be equal to the product
of (1) the Net Mineral Acre Price therefor _multiplied by_  (2) the remainder
of (x) the actual number of Net Leasehold Mineral Acres included in such
Undeveloped Lease after giving effect to such Title Benefit _minus_ (y) the
number of Net Leasehold Mineral Acres purported to be included in such
Undeveloped Lease as set forth on _Exhibit_ __ _ A-1_;

(iii) if a Title Benefit as to any Fee Mineral Interest represents a positive
discrepancy between (A) the actual Net Revenue Interest for any such Fee
Mineral Interests and (B) the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on 
_Exhibit_ __ _ A-2_ for such Fee Mineral Interest, then the Title Benefit
Amount shall be equal to (1) the product of the Net Mineral Acre Price
thereof, _multiplied by_  (2) the number of Net Fee Mineral Acres of such Fee
Mineral Interest subject to such Title Benefit _multiplied by_ (3) a fraction,
the numerator of which is (x) the remainder of (I) the actual Net Revenue
Interest for such Fee Mineral Interest after giving effect to such Title
Benefit _minus_ (II) the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit_ __ _ A-2_
for such Fee Mineral Interest and the denominator of which is (y) the Net
Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit_ __ _ A-2_ for such Fee Mineral Interest;
_provided_ that if the Title Benefit does not affect the "Net
Revenue Interest" percentage stated on _Exhibit_ __ _ A-2_ for such Fee
Mineral Interest throughout its entire productive life, the Title Benefit
Amount determined under this _Section 3.2(e)(iii)_ shall be reduced to take
into account the applicable time period only;

(iv) if a Title Benefit constitutes an increase in the number of Net Fee
Mineral Acres as to any Fee Mineral Interest (or portion thereof) greater than
the number purported to be included in such Fee Mineral Interest as set forth
on  _Exhibit_ __ _ A-2_, then the Title Benefit Amount for such Title
Benefit shall be equal to the product of (1) the Net Mineral Acre Price
allocated to such Fee Mineral Interest  _multiplied by_ (2) the remainder of
(x) the actual number of Net Fee Mineral Acres included in such Fee Mineral
Interest after giving effect to such Title Benefit _minus_ (y) the number of
Net Fee Mineral Acres purported to be included in such Fee Mineral Interest
as set forth on _Exhibit_ __ _ A-2_; and

 



-43- (v) if the Title Benefit represents a benefit of a type not described in
_Section 3.2(e)(i)_ through _Section 3.2(e)(iv)_ , the Title Benefit Amount
shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Oil and
Gas Property so affected, the portion of Sellers interest in the Oil and Gas
Property affected by the Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title
Benefit, the potential positive economic effect of the Title Benefit over the
life of the affected Oil and Gas Property, the values placed upon the Title
Benefit by Purchaser and Seller, and such other factors as are necessary to
make an evaluation and determination of such value.

(f) _Individual Defect Threshold and Defect Deductibles_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

(i) There shall be no adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under
_Section 3.2(g)_ for any Defect or Defects to the extent the Defect Amount for
such Defect is less than the Individual Defect Threshold (it being agreed that
the Individual Defect Threshold represents a threshold and not a deductible);

(ii) With respect to all valid Defects where the Defect Amount thereof exceeds
the Individual Defect Threshold, there shall be no adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price under _Section 3.2(g)_ with respect to any and all
such Defects unless and until the aggregate Defect Amounts thereof that
exceeds the Individual Defect Threshold also exceeds the Defect Deductible
and then only to the extent such aggregate amount exceeds the Defect
Deductible (it being the intention of the Parties that the Defect Deductible
represents a deductible and not a threshold);

 

(iii) If a Title Defect affects more than one Oil and Gas Property, the Defect
Amount for such Title Defect shall be deemed to meet the Individual Threshold
if the aggregate sum of the Defect Amounts for all Oil and Gas Properties
affected by such Title Defect meets or exceeds the Individual Threshold; and

 

(iv) The Defect Amount for an Environmental Defect shall be deemed to meet the
Individual Threshold in any of the following cases: (x) if an Environmental
Defect affects more than one Asset, the aggregate sum of the Defect Amounts
for all Assets affected by such Environmental Defect meets or exceeds the
Individual Threshold, or (y) in the case of multiple instances of lack
of required air Permits or proof of air Permit-by-Rule qualification with the
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the aggregate sum of the Defect
Amounts for all such common Environmental Defects meets or exceeds the
Individual Threshold.

(g) _Sole and Exclusive Remedies for Defects_. Subject to Sellers right to
dispute the existence of a Defect and the Defect Amount asserted with respect
thereto, in the event that any valid Defect is not waived in writing by
Purchaser or is not cured on or prior to the date ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, then:

(i) subject to Sellers rights under _Section 3.2(g_ _)(_ _ii)_ and
_Section 3.2(g)(iii)_ , with respect to all uncured Defects for which the
Defect Amount with respect thereto exceeds the Individual Defect Threshold,
the applicable Assets shall be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing and the
Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be decreased by the sum of the aggregate
Defect Amounts attributable to all such Defects, but only to the extent such
aggregate sum with respect to Defects exceeds the Defect Deductible, it being
the intention of the Parties that the Defect Deductible constitutes a
deductible and not a threshold;

 



-44- (ii) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in lieu of the remedy
for Defects set forth in _Section 3.2(g)(_ _i_ _)_ , to the extent necessary
to reduce the aggregate downward Purchase Price adjustments for Defects to an
amount less than the amount of the Defect Deductible, Seller shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to elect in writing delivered to Purchaser on
or prior to the Closing Date, to exclude such affected Oil and Gas Property
subject to such Defect (along with any other Assets reasonably necessary or
desirable for the ownership or operation of such Assets) from the
transactions contemplated hereunder and, in such event, (A) the Unadjusted

Section 7.5 _Notice to Holders of Consent and Preferential Purchase Rights_.
Promptly after the Execution Date, but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days after the Execution Date, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to prepare (with review and reasonable comment from
Purchaser as to form and substance) and send, or cause to be prepared
and sent, (a) notices to the holders of any Required Consents and other
Consents (other than Customary Consents) that are set forth on _Schedule_ __ _
4.11_ requesting consents and approvals to the transactions of
Seller contemplated by this Agreement and (b) notices to the holders of any
applicable preferential rights to purchase or similar rights that are set
forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 4.11_ in compliance with the terms of such rights
and requesting waivers of such rights. In attempting to identify the names
and addresses of such Persons holding such Consents or preferential rights to
purchase, Seller shall not in any event be obligated to go beyond Sellers own
Records. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such Consents, to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing
and all such preferential rights to purchase to be waived, _provided_ that
neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be required to make payments or undertake
obligations to obtain any such Consents or waivers. Subject to the foregoing
covenants, Seller shall not be liable or obligated to Purchaser for any
damages or liabilities related or attributable to Customary Consents that are
not obtained before, on, or after Closing. If prior to Closing, Purchaser
discovers any Consents, Required Consent, or preferential rights to purchase
or similar rights that are not set forth on  _Schedule_ __ _ 4.11_ and are
applicable to the Assets, Purchaser shall promptly (but in any event within
three (3) Business Days) after discovery provide written notice to Seller of
such Consents, Required Consents, or preferential rights, whereupon Seller
shall promptly thereafter send the notices and requests as to such Consents,
Required Consents, and preferential rights required under and in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_,  _Section_ __ _ 7.6_, and _Section_ __ _
7.7_, as applicable.

Section 7.6 _Consents to Assignment_.

(a) In cases in which the Asset subject to an unobtained Required Consent is
an Asset other than an Oil and Gas Property, and Purchaser is assigned the
Oil and Gas Property or Oil and Gas Properties to which such Asset relates,
but such Asset is not transferred to Purchaser due to the unwaived Required
Consent, the Parties shall continue after Closing to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the Required Consent so that such Asset can be
transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of the Required Consent, and, if
permitted pursuant to applicable Law and agreement, such Asset shall be held
by Seller for the benefit of Purchaser, Purchaser shall assume as part of the
Assumed Obligations and bear and pay all amounts due thereunder or with
respect thereto, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the performance of any
obligations and Damages under or with respect to such Asset to the extent
that Purchaser has been transferred the Assets necessary to such performance
until the applicable Required Consent is obtained. In cases in which (i) the
Asset is an Asset other than an Oil and Gas Property, (ii) such Asset is
subject to an unobtained Consent other than a Required Consent, (iii) such
Consent is not rejected in writing by the holder thereof, and (iv) Purchaser
is assigned the Oil and Gas Property or Oil and Gas Properties to which such
Asset relates, the Asset shall nevertheless be conveyed at Closing to
Purchaser as part of the Assets.

 



-65- (b) In cases in which the Asset subject to a Required Consent requirement is
an Oil and Gas Property and the Required Consent is not obtained by Closing
or the Required Consent is denied in writing by the holder thereof, then the
Oil and Gas Property subject to such Required Consent (along with any other
Assets reasonably necessary or desirable for the ownership or operation of
such Oil and Gas Property) shall be excluded from the Assets to be assigned to
Purchaser at Closing, in which event, (i) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the Allocated Value of such excluded Oil and Gas Property and
other Assets, (ii) such excluded Oil and Gas Property and other Assets shall
be deemed to be deleted from _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ and added to _Schedule_ __ _
1.1(a)_, and (iii) such excluded Oil and Gas Property and other Assets shall
constitute Excluded Assets for all purposes hereunder. If any such Required
Consent requirement with respect to which an adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price is made under  _Section 2.4(a)_ is subsequently obtained prior
to the Cut-Off Date, (A) Seller shall, promptly after such Required Consent
requirement is satisfied, but in no event later than ten (10) days after such
Required Consent is satisfied, convey the applicable Oil and Gas Property and
Assets to Purchaser, (B) the Parties shall deliver all instruments and
documents that would have been required under the terms hereof to be delivered
at Closing with respect to such Oil and Gas Property and Assets, (C)
Purchaser shall, simultaneously with the conveyance of the applicable Oil and
Gas Property and Assets, pay the amount of any previous deduction from the
Unadjusted Purchase Price (subject to all other applicable adjustments with
respect to such Oil and Gas Properties and Assets under _Section_ __ _ 2.4_)
to Seller, and (D) such Oil and Gas Property and Assets shall no longer be
deemed to be (1) deleted from _Exhibit_ __ _ A_, (2) added to _Schedule_ __
_ 1.1(a)_, or (3) Excluded Assets for any purposes hereunder.

 

(c) In cases in which an Asset subject to a Consent is an Oil and Gas
Property, and such Consent is (i) not a Required Consent, (ii) not obtained
by Closing, and (iii) not denied in writing by the holder thereof, then the
Asset subject to such Consent shall nevertheless be conveyed at Closing to
Purchaser as part of the Assets and Purchaser shall pay for the affected
Asset as though the Consent had been obtained.

Section 7.7 _Preferential Rights_.

 

(a) Any preferential purchase right must be exercised subject to all terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the successful Closing of
this Agreement pursuant to _Article 9_ , on the dates set forth herein. The
consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for
purposes of preferential purchase right notices shall be the Allocated Value
for such Asset, adjusted as set forth herein.

(b) If any preferential right to purchase any Assets is validly exercised
prior to Closing, then (i) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by
the Allocated Value of such Asset, (ii) such Assets shall be deemed to be
deleted from _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ and added to _Schedule_ __ _ 1.1(a)_,
and (iii) such Assets shall constitute Excluded Assets for all purposes
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event the holder of any
preferential right to purchase any Assets validly exercises such preferential
right prior to Closing but refuses or fails to consummate the purchase of
such Assets on or before the Cut-Off Date (or such later date as provided for
under the instrument giving rise to such preferential right, as applicable),
(A) Seller shall promptly convey the applicable Assets to Purchaser, (B) the
Parties shall deliver all instruments and documents that would have been
required under the terms hereof to be delivered

  



-66-  at Closing with respect to such Assets, (C) Purchaser shall, simultaneously
with the conveyance of the applicable Assets, pay the amount of any previous
deduction from the Unadjusted Purchase Price (subject to all other applicable
adjustments with respect to such Assets under _Section_ __ _ 2.4_) to Seller,
and (D) such Assets shall no longer be deemed to be (1) deleted from 
_Exhibit_ __ _ A_, (2) added to _Schedule_ __ _ 1.1(a)_, or (3) Excluded
Assets for any purposes hereunder.

 

(c) Should a Third Party fail to validly exercise or waive its preferential
right to purchase as to any portion of the Assets prior to Closing, and the
time for exercise or waiver of such preferential right has not yet expired,
then (i) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall not be reduced by the Allocated
Value of such Assets, (ii) such Assets shall be included in the Assets
and conveyed by Seller to Purchaser at Closing, (iii) from and after Closing,
Purchaser shall be entitled to all amounts payable by such holder in
connection with such preferential right to purchase, and (iv) from and after
Closing, Purchaser shall comply with, be responsible for and perform all
obligations arising with or attributable to such preferential rights to
purchase.

 

(d) Purchaser acknowledges that Seller desires to sell all of its Assets and
would not have entered into this Agreement but for Purchasers agreement to
purchase all of the Assets as herein provided. Accordingly, it is expressly
understood and agreed that Seller does not desire to sell to any Person other
than Purchaser any Assets subject to any preferential right to purchase
unless the sale of all of the Assets is consummated by the Closing Date in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the applicable
preferential right to purchase. In furtherance of the foregoing, Sellers
obligation hereunder to sell its Assets subject to any preferential right to
purchase to any Person other than Purchaser is expressly conditioned upon the
consummation by the Closing Date of the sale of all of the Assets (other than
Excluded Assets) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, either by
conveyance to Purchaser or conveyance pursuant to an applicable preference
right; _provided_ that, nothing herein is intended or shall operate to extend
or apply any preference right to any portion of such Assets which is not
otherwise burdened thereby.

Section 7.8 _Casualty and Condemnation_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary from and after the Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Purchaser
shall assume all risk of loss with respect to production of Hydrocarbons
through normal depletion (including watering out of any Well, collapsed
casing, or sand infiltration of any Well) and the depreciation of the Assets
due to ordinary wear and tear, in each case, with respect to the Assets. If,
after the Execution Date but prior to or on the Closing Date, any portion of
the Oil and Gas Properties are destroyed by fire, explosion, wild well,
hurricane, storm, weather events, earthquake, act of nature, civil unrest, or
similar disorder, terrorist acts, war, or any other hostilities or other
casualty or is expropriated or taken in condemnation or under right of
eminent domain (each a " __ _Casualty Loss_ __"), Purchaser and Seller shall,
subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions to Closing set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, nevertheless be required
to proceed with Closing.

Section 7.9 _Closing Efforts and Further Assurances_. Each Party agrees that
from and after the Execution Date it will not voluntarily undertake any course
of action inconsistent with the provisions or intent of this Agreement and
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all action and to do, or cause to be done, all actions reasonably necessary,
proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the transaction

 



-67-  contemplated hereunder, including (a) using its commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the other Party to cause to be lifted or rescinded
any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the
ability of the Parties to consummate the transaction contemplated hereunder,
and (b) executing any additional instruments and agreements necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.10 _Notifications_. Purchaser shall notify Seller promptly after a
discovery by Purchaser that any representation or warranty of Seller
contained in this Agreement is, becomes, or will be untrue in any material
respect on or before the Closing Date. Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly
after a discovery by Seller that any representation or warranty of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement is, becomes, or will be untrue in any material
respect on or before the Closing Date. It is understood and agreed that the
delivery of any notice required under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.10_ shall not
in any manner constitute a waiver by any Party of any conditions precedent to
the Closing hereunder.

 

Section 7.11 _Amendment of Seller Disclosure Schedules_. Purchaser and Seller
agree that, with respect to the representations and warranties of Purchaser
Parties and Seller, as applicable, contained in this Agreement, (i) Seller
shall have the continuing right until the Closing to add, supplement, or amend
the Seller Disclosure Schedules to the representations and warranties of
Seller with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered which, if
existing or known at the Execution Date or thereafter, would have been
required to be set forth or described in such Schedules and (ii) Purchaser
shall have the continuing right until the Closing to add, supplement, or
amend any disclosure schedules to the representations and warranties of
Purchaser Parties with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered
which, if existing or known at the Execution Date or thereafter, would have
been required to be set forth or described in such schedules. For all purposes
of this Agreement, including for purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_ or  _Section 8.2(a)_ have been
fulfilled, the Seller Disclosure Schedules and any Disclosure Schedules of the
Purchaser Parties attached to this Agreement shall be deemed to include only
that information contained therein on the Execution Date and shall be deemed
to exclude all information contained in any addition, supplement, or amendment
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the information contained in any
addition, supplement, or amendment thereto would result in the failure of the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_ or _Section 8.2(a)_ to be satisfied
at Closing, and the Party who could otherwise terminate this Agreement in
respect of such failure elects to waive such failure and consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, then all matters disclosed pursuant to
any such addition, supplement, or amendment at or prior to the Closing shall
be waived and such waiving Party shall not be entitled to make a claim with
respect thereto pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise.

Section 7.12 _Government Reviews_.

 

(a) From and after the Execution Date until the Closing, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each of Purchaser and Seller shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, undertake commercially reasonable
efforts to make or cause to be made promptly (and, in the case of filings
required to be made pursuant to the HSR Act, not later than fifteen (15)
Business Days after the Execution Date) the filings required of such Party or
any of its Affiliates under any Laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement

 



-68-  and to pay any fees due of it in connection with such filings; _provided,
however_ , that all fees payable to any Governmental Authorities relating to
filings required to be made pursuant to the HSR Act shall be paid and borne
by Purchaser except that all fees payable in connection with any filing in
which Seller is the Acquiring Person within the meaning of the HSR Act and the
applicable regulations thereunder shall be paid and borne by Seller. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Purchaser and
Seller shall, to the extent permissible by Law, (i) cooperate with the other
Party and furnish to the other Party all information in such
Partys possession that is necessary in connection with such other Partys
filings; (ii) promptly inform the other Party of, and supply to such other
Party copies of, any communication (or other correspondence or memoranda) from
or to, and any proposed understanding or agreement with, any Governmental
Authority in respect of such filings; (iii) consult and cooperate with the
other Party and provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to provide

of any Party in connection with all meetings, actions and proceedings with any
Governmental Authority relating to such filings; and (iv) comply, as promptly
as is reasonably practicable, with any requests received by such Party or any
of its Affiliates under the HSR Act and any other Laws for additional
information, documents, or other materials. If a Party intends to participate
in any communication or meeting with any Governmental Authority with respect
to such filings, it shall give the other Party reasonable notice of, and to
the extent permitted by the Governmental Authority, an opportunity to
participate in any such meeting or communication. Seller and Purchaser shall
jointly determine any strategy or tactic in complying with this _Section_ __ _
7.12_, including _Section 7.12(b)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller
shall not be required to provide Purchaser with any Excluded Records and no
Party shall be required to provide the other Party with information regarding
the value of the transaction or subject to any legal privilege, attorney
client privilege, work product doctrine, or other similar privilege absent
entering into a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement.

(b) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take any and all
steps to (i) cause the expiration or early termination of the applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as is practicable
but in no event later than the Termination Date; and (ii) avoid each and every
impediment under Antitrust Laws and resolve any objection or assertion by any
Governmental Authority or any action or proceeding by any Governmental
Authority or other person, whether by judicial or administrative action,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the performance of obligations hereunder so
as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably practicable (and in
any event not later than the Termination Date), including but not limited to:
(x) agreeing to divest, hold separate, or otherwise commit to take any action
that limits its freedom of action with respect to its ability to retain any
of the business, services or assets of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; (y)
entering into or terminating any agreement with respect to any Purchasers
assets, business, or operations; and (z) contesting and resisting any action
or proceeding instituted (or threatened in writing to be instituted) by any
Governmental Authority challenging the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as in violation of any Law; _provided, however_ , that any
condition to which Purchaser agrees may be conditioned on the Closing of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser shall be responsible for
and shall pay all of fees, expenses, and costs in complying with this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.12_ and reimburse Seller for all such similar fees,
expenses, and costs.

 



-69- Section 7.13 _Liability for Brokers  Fees_. Each Party hereby agrees to
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party, any Affiliate of such
other Party, and all such other Partys stockholders, members, officers,
directors, employees, agents, lenders, advisors, representatives, accountants,
attorneys, and consultants from and against any and all claims, obligations,
damages, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses (including court costs and
reasonable attorneys fees) arising as a result of undertakings or agreements
of any such indemnifying Party prior to Closing, for brokerage fees, finders
fees, agents commissions, or other similar forms of compensation to an
intermediary in connection with the negotiation, execution or delivery of this
Agreement or any agreement or document contemplated hereunder.

Section 7.14 _Bulk Sales Laws_. Purchaser acknowledges that no member of the
Seller Group will comply with the provisions of any bulk sales Laws in any
jurisdiction in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and Purchaser waives and releases, and shall fully indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless each member of the Seller Group against, any claims
against any member of the Seller Group arising from such non-compliance.

 

Section 7.15 _Press Releases_. From and after the Execution Date, Purchaser
shall not make, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to make, any press
release or public disclosure regarding the existence of this Agreement, the
contents hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby, or the identities of
any Parties hereto without the prior written consent of Seller; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the foregoing shall not restrict disclosures by Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates (a) to the extent that such disclosures are required by
applicable securities or other Laws or the applicable rules of any stock
exchange having jurisdiction over Purchaser or Affiliate of Purchaser or (b)
to Governmental Authorities or any Third Party holding preferential rights to
purchase, rights of consent, or other rights that may be applicable to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as reasonably necessary to
provide notices, seek waivers, amendments, or terminations of such rights, or
seek such consents. Purchaser shall be liable for the compliance of
Purchasers Affiliates with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 7.15_.

Section 7.16 _Credit Support_. The Parties agree and acknowledge that except
as expressly provided in this _Section_ __ _ 7.16_, none of the Credit
Support provided by or on behalf of any member of the Seller Group in support
of the obligations of any member of the Seller Group related to the ownership
or operation of the Assets, including those Credit Support obligations
described on _Schedule_ __ _ 7.16_, shall be included in or constitute any
Assets or transferred to the Purchaser at Closing. At or prior to the
Closing, Purchaser shall post and provide any and all Credit Support necessary
to obtain the release, return, and replacement of all Credit Support provided
by or on behalf of any member of the Seller Group in support of the
obligations of any member of the Seller Group related to the ownership or
operation of the Assets, including those Credit Support obligations described
on _Schedule_ __ _ 7.16_. At the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the return or
reimbursement of Seller for any cash deposits constituting Credit Support
that are provided, funded, or otherwise supported by any member of the Seller
Group with respect to the Assets to be assigned hereunder by Seller.

 



-70- Section 7.17 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser or
one of its Affiliates may make offers of employment to the Business Employees
of its choosing. Such offers shall be conditioned upon the occurrence of
Closing and for employment as of the Closing Date or, if later, such date on
which the applicable Business Employee returns from a leave of absence (so
long as such return occurs within one-hundred and eighty (180) days after the
Closing or such later time as may be required by applicable Law). Each offer
of employment shall initially, and for a period of at least twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date (the " __ _Protected Period_ __"), provide
for: (i) a base salary (or base wage rate) that is no less favorable than
that in effect for such the Business Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date, (ii) incentive compensation (excluding equity compensation) and
bonus opportunities that are no less favorable than those in effect for such
Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) a package
of employee benefits, including health, welfare, and retirement benefits
(excluding defined benefits pursuant to qualified and nonqualified requirement
plans, retiree medical benefits, and other retiree health and welfare
arrangements), that are at least substantially comparable in the aggregate to
the package of employee benefits made available by Purchaser to Purchasers
employees, in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Purchaser
Benefit Plans, as they may be amended. Except as necessary to comply with the
preceding sentence, nothing in this Agreement will require Purchaser to
maintain any specific benefit plans or amend any Purchaser Benefit Plan. Each
such employment offer shall be subject to and conditioned upon the occurrence
of the Closing. The date of a Business Employees commencement of active
employment with Purchaser or its Affiliate is referred to as his or her " __
_Hire Date_ __".

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, a " __ _Transferred Employee_ __" is
a Business Employee who accepts an offer of employment from Purchaser or one
of its Affiliates made pursuant to _Section 7.17(a)_ and becomes employed by
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates pursuant to the process set forth in
_Section 7.17(a)_ above. With respect to each Transferred Employee, effective
as of the time immediately prior to such Transferred Employees Hire Date,
Seller or its Affiliates shall terminate the employment of such Transferred
Employee.

 

(c) Effective from and after the respective Hire Date, each Transferred
Employee shall be provided with service credit for all purposes under the
employee benefit plans of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (the " __
_Purchaser Benefit Plans_ __") in which such Transferred Employee participates
on or after such Hire Date to the extent service with a predecessor employer
is recognized under the terms of such Purchaser Benefit Plans (other than (i)
for purposes of benefit accruals under any ERISA Title IV pension plan, (ii)
for vesting purposes under any equity or incentive compensation plan, or
(iii) to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits) for such
Transferred Employees service with Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates. If
permitted under the Purchaser Benefit Plan, such service credit will
be recognized to the same extent such service was recognized for a similar
purpose under a corresponding Seller Benefit Plan in which such Transferred
Employee participated immediately prior to such Hire Date. Nothing in this
Agreement will require Purchaser to maintain any specific benefit plans or
amend any Purchaser Benefit Plan that does not recognize service with a
predecessor employer.

 



-71- (d) Effective from and after the respective Hire Date, for purposes of each
Purchaser Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, prescription drug, and/or
vision benefits in which the Transferred Employees are eligible to participate
following the respective Hire Date, if applicable and to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, take
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health and
welfare coverage of any Transferred Employee and his or her eligible
dependents due to pre-existing conditions or waiting periods, active
employment requirements and requirements to show evidence of good health under
such Purchaser Benefit Plan to any Transferred Employee to the extent
required by Law or permitted by the Purchaser Benefit Plans; and (ii) obtain
credit under the Purchaser Benefit Plans for each Transferred Employee for any
co-payments and deductibles paid by such Transferred Employee and his or her
covered dependents prior to such Hire Date and in the same plan year in which
such Hire Date occurs towards satisfying the applicable annual deductibles and
annual out-of-pocket limits, in each case, to the extent consistent with the
then existing terms of such Purchaser Benefit Plan.

 

(e) Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, offer to the
Transferred Employees who immediately prior to their respective Hire Dates
were eligible to participate in the Seller 401(k) Plan, eligibility to
participate in a defined contribution plan that is tax-qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code and that contains a Section 401(k) feature (the " __
_Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ __") pursuant to the terms of the Purchaser 401(k)
Plan. Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall cause the Purchaser 401(k) Plan
to accept the direct rollover of each Transferred Employee s account
distributed from the Seller 401(k) Plan (including any notes representing
participant loans), but only to the extent acceptance of direct rollovers and
receipt of notes representing participant loans are permitted under the terms
of the Purchaser 401(k) Plan.

(f) As of each Transferred Employees Hire Date, Purchaser shall assume and
honor each Transferred Employees accrued but unused vacation days and paid
time off days, subject to the terms and limits under Purchasers vacation and
paid time off policies for similarly situated employees.

 

(g) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date that
is two (2) years after (i) the Closing Date in the event Closing occurs and
(ii) the Termination Date in the event this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Article 11_ (the " __ _Non-Solicit Period_ __")
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates that is a
Restricted Person not to, in any way directly or indirectly solicit, induce,
hire, retain, or attempt to hire or retain any employee of Seller or its
Affiliates (other than as expressly permitted under this _Section_ __ _
7.17_ with respect to the Business Employees); _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) the foregoing shall not apply to generalized searches for employees by use
of advertisements in the media that are not targeted at employees of Seller
or any of its Affiliates and (ii) Purchaser shall not be restrained from
hiring employees whose employment by Seller or any of its Affiliates has
terminated prior to commencement of employment discussions.

The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.17_ are solely for the benefit of the
Parties and nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.17_, express or implied, shall
confer upon any Business Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary
thereof, or upon any other Person, any rights or remedies, including any right
to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this
Agreement. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.17_, express or implied, shall be
(i) deemed an amendment of a Seller Benefit Plan providing benefits to any
Business Employee, (ii) deemed an amendment of a Purchaser Benefit Plan
providing benefits to any Transferred Employee, or (iii) construed to prevent
Purchaser or its Affiliates from terminating or modifying to any extent or in
any respect any employee benefit plan that Purchaser or its Affiliates may
establish or maintain.

 



-72- Section 7.18 _Expenses; Filings, Certain Governmental Approvals and Removal
of Names_.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all expenses
incurred by Seller in connection with or related to the authorization,
preparation, or execution of this Agreement, and the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto and thereto, and all other matters related to the Closing, including
all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, and financial
advisers employed by Seller, shall be borne solely and entirely by Seller,
and all such expenses incurred by Purchaser shall be borne solely and entirely
by Purchaser.

 

(b) Promptly after the Closing, Purchaser shall (i) record all assignments of
Assets executed at the Closing in the records of the applicable Governmental
Authorities, (ii) if applicable, send notices to vendors supplying goods and
services for the Assets and to the operator of such Assets of the assignment
of such Assets to Purchaser, (iii) actively pursue the unconditional approval
of all Customary Consents and approval of all applicable Governmental
Authorities of the assignment of the Assets to Purchaser, and (iv) actively
pursue all other consents and approvals that may be required in
connection with the assignment of the Assets to Purchaser and the assumption
of the Assumed Obligations, that, in each case, shall not have been obtained
prior to the Closing. Purchaser obligates itself to take any and all action
required by any Governmental Authority in order to obtain such unconditional
approval, including the posting of any and all bonds or other security that
may be required in excess of its existing lease, pipeline, or area-wide bond.

 

(c) Upon the occurrence of Closing, as promptly as practicable, but in any
case within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall eliminate
the names "Brigham Resources Operating, LLC", "Brigham Resources Midstream,
LLC", "Brigham", and any variants thereof from the Assets acquired pursuant to
this Agreement and, except with respect to such grace period for eliminating
existing usage, shall have no right to use any logos, trademarks, or trade
names belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

Section 7.19 _Records_.

 

(a) No later than sixty (60) days after Closing, Seller shall make available
to Purchaser the Records that are in the possession of Seller for pickup or
copying, as applicable, during normal business hours, subject to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.19_.

(b) Seller may retain, at Sellers sole cost and expense, copies of any and
all Records. Seller may retain the originals of those Records relating to
Asset Tax and accounting matters and provide Purchaser, at its request, with
copies of such Records (i) that pertain to Asset Tax matters solely related
to the Assets or (ii) if such Records are necessary for Purchaser to
adequately prepare Tax Returns or to contest a legal or administrative
proceeding pursuant to _Article 10_.

  



-73- (c) Purchaser shall preserve and keep a copy of all Records in Purchasers
possession for a period of at least seven (7) years after the Closing Date.
After such seven (7) year period, before Purchaser shall dispose of any such
Records, Purchaser shall give Seller at least ninety (90) days Notice to such
effect, and Seller shall be given an opportunity, at Sellers cost and
expense, to remove and retain all or any part of such Records as Seller may
select. From and after Closing, Purchaser shall provide to Seller, at no cost
or expense to Seller, full access to such books and records as remain in
Purchasers possession and full access to the Assets and other properties and
employees of Purchaser in connection with matters relating to the ownership or
operations of the Assets on or before the Closing Date, any Retained
Liabilities or any claims or disputes relating to this Agreement or with any
Third Parties.

Section 7.20  _Non-Compete_.

(a) As a material inducement to Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, from
and after Closing Seller shall not, and Seller shall undertake reasonable
efforts to cause the other Restricted Persons not to, directly or indirectly,
acquire in any capacity during the period between the Closing Date and ending
on the date that is six (6) months after the Execution Date (the " __ _Non-
Compete Period_ __"), acquire any Hydrocarbon Leasehold Opportunity, whether
alone or as a partner, joint venturer, or equity interest holder of any
Person acquiring a Hydrocarbon Leasehold Opportunity; _provided_ , that Seller
shall be entitled to acquire a Hydrocarbon Leasehold Opportunity in a
transaction or series of related transactions covering assets that are both
(i) within both the Non-Compete Area and (ii) outside of the Non-Compete Area,
but only if less than fifty percent (50%) of the Net Leasehold Mineral Acres
included in such transaction or series of transactions or less than fifty
percent (50%) of the allocated value of such assets included in such
transaction or series of transactions are located within the Non-Compete Area.
If Seller consummates such acquisition, then Seller shall assign (or cause to
be assigned) such Hydrocarbon Leasehold Opportunity ( _insofar and only
insofar as_ the same covers the Non-Compete Area) to Purchaser, and Purchaser
shall pay to Seller the same consideration paid by Seller, and assume and
perform all obligations and liabilities assumed by Seller, for such
Hydrocarbon Leasehold Opportunity ( _insofar and only insofar as_ such
consideration, obligations, and liabilities are attributable or are allocable
to the lands within the Non-Compete Area).

 

(b) Promptly after the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser ownership
reports covering the Lands in Sellers or its Affiliates possession or
control.

(c) The Parties agree that the limitations contained in this _Section_ __ _
7.20_ with respect to time, geographical area and scope of activity are
reasonable in all respects and necessary to preserve the value of the goodwill
and Assets being conveyed by Seller pursuant to this Agreement. However, if
any court shall determine that the time, geographical area or scope of
activity of any restriction contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.20_ is
unenforceable, it is the intention of the Parties that such restrictive
covenant set forth herein shall not thereby be terminated but shall be deemed
amended to the extent required to render it valid and enforceable.

(d) The Parties acknowledge that, because of the nature and subject matter of
this _Section_ __ _ 7.20_, it would be impractical and extremely difficult to
determine Purchasers actual damages in the event of a breach of Sellers
obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.20_. Without prejudice to the
rights and remedies otherwise available to Purchaser hereunder, the Parties
agree

 



-74-  that money damages may not be an adequate remedy for breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.20_ by Seller and that if Seller or another Restricted
Person commits a breach, or threatens to commit a breach, of this _Section_
__ _ 7.20_, Purchaser shall have the right to have the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.20_ specifically enforced by any court having jurisdiction;
it being acknowledged and agreed by Seller that any such breach or threatened
breach may cause irreparable injury to Purchaser and that an injunction may be
issued against the applicable Seller and any Affiliate of Seller to stop or
prevent any such breach or threatened breach. The remedies set forth in the
preceding sentence shall be in addition to all other remedies available to
Purchaser at Law or in equity.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 7.20 shall prohibit or
restrict Sellers ability to undertake curative actions with respect to
Defects as permitted under _Section 3.2(c)_.

Section 7.21 _Listing of Stock Purchase Price_. At the Closing, Purchaser
Parent shall issue the Stock Purchase Price in accordance with all applicable
securities Laws and the rules and policies of The Nasdaq Global Select Market.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser Parent shall
complete all such filings with The Nasdaq Global Select Market and otherwise
take all such actions as may be reasonably necessary for the Stock Purchase
Price to be accepted by The Nasdaq Global Select Market for issuance
and approved for listing thereon from and after the time of Closing, subject
to official notice of issuance. If Purchaser Parent applies to have its Common
Stock or other securities traded on any principal stock exchange or market
other than The Nasdaq Global Select Market, it shall include in such
application the Stock Purchase Price and will take such other action as is
necessary to cause such Stock Purchase Price to be so listed.

 

Section 7.22 _Required Information_.

 

(a) Seller acknowledges that prior to Closing Purchaser Parent may be required
pursuant to Regulation S-X under the Securities Act to disclose certain
information with respect to Seller. Accordingly, without giving any
representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of any such
information, promptly upon written request of Purchaser, Seller has provided
Purchaser Parent with access to (i) the audited balance sheets of Seller as of
December 31, 2015 and Sellers audited income statements, statements of
comprehensive income, statements of cash flows and members equity for the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014 (audited by Cawley, Gillespie and
Associates) and (ii) the unaudited interim financial statements of Seller
at September 30, 2016 and the nine months then ended (the " __ _Required Pre-
Closing Information_ __"). Seller shall cause the personnel of Seller, and
Seller s Affiliates, and shall request its independent auditors, to
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser Parent, to the extent reasonably requested
by Purchaser Parent, in the interpretation, preparation and disclosure of such
Required Pre-Closing Information. Promptly after the Execution Date, Seller
shall request Sellers independent auditors (i) to provide customary "comfort
letters" to any underwriter or purchaser, (ii) consent to be named an expert,
in any offering memorandum, private placement memorandum or prospectus by
Purchaser Parent in which Required Pre-Closing Information is required or
customary.

 



-75- (b) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date or, if not available to
Seller at such time, promptly after Sellers receipt thereof, Seller shall
provide Purchaser Parent with audited statements of revenues and direct
expenses attributable to the Assets for the years ended December 31, 2014,
2015, and 2016. Within thirty (30) days after the later of the Closing Date
and March 31, 2017, Seller shall provide Purchaser Parent with unaudited
statements of revenues and direct expenses attributable to the Assets for the
three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. In addition, from and after the
Closing Date until the date nine (9) months after the Closing Date and subject
to Purchaser, its Affiliates and its and their Representatives entering into
such confidentiality agreements as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser,
Seller agrees that to the extent reasonably requested by Purchaser Parent,
Seller shall provide to Purchaser Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable
such other operating and financial records and information relating to Seller
and the Assets as may be necessary, in the reasonable determination of
Purchaser Parent, to comply with the requirements for an offer and sale of
securities under the Securities Act and/or the rules set forth in Regulation
S-X thereunder (together with the Required Pre-Closing Information, the " __
_Required Information_ __"). Seller shall cause the personnel of Seller, and
Seller s Affiliates, and shall request its independent auditors, reserve
engineers and other applicable consultants or service providers, to cooperate
with Purchaser Parent in the interpretation, preparation and disclosure of
such Required Information. Seller shall request Sellers independent auditors
(i) to provide customary "comfort letters" to any underwriter or purchaser in
a securities offering by Purchaser Parent, (ii) consent to be named an expert
in any offering memorandum, private placement memorandum or prospectus used by
Purchaser, and (iii) provide access to the work papers of Sellers independent
auditors related to the Required Information, but subject to such firms
policy and procedures relating to such work papers.

(c) Purchaser Parent shall reimburse Seller, within ten (10) Business Days
after receipt of demand in writing therefor, together with such reasonable
supporting documents as may be requested by Purchaser Parent, for all third
party costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Seller in connection with
Sellers compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.22_, excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, reimbursement of overhead, salaries, or benefits
attributable to Sellers and its Affiliates employees for the provision of
such assistance and cooperation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
herein shall expand Sellers representations, warranties, covenants, or
agreements set forth in this Agreement or give Purchaser, its Affiliates, or
any Third Party any rights to which it is not entitled hereunder.

(d) Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each member of the
Seller Group from and against any and all Damages (including court costs and
reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with Sellers performance of any
obligations or assistance provided under this _Section_ __ _ 7.22_, including
Damages attributable to, arising out of or relating to any books, record,
documents, representation letters or other information provided by or on
behalf of any member of the Seller Group in connection with this _Section_ __
_ 7.22_, EVEN IF SUCH CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES,
COSTS, AND EXPENSES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER
SOLE, JOINT, OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF
ANY MEMBER OF THE SELLER GROUP; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing
shall not apply to the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any member of
the Seller Group. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no
event shall Seller be obligated hereunder to disclose, provide or grant access
to any books, records, information or documents to the extent such disclosure,
provision or access would, in the reasonable discretion of Seller, (a)
violate applicable Laws, (b) be likely to result in the waiver any legal
privilege of Seller, any of its Affiliates or its counselors, attorneys,
accountants or consultants, or (c) violate any obligations to any Third
Party.

 



-76- Section 7.23 _Additional Acquisitions_.

 

(a) If any time prior to 5:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on the date five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the " __ _Option Deadline_ __"),
Seller acquires title to any of the following within the Non-Compete Area (i)
any interests in any Hydrocarbon leases (each an " __ _Additional Lease_
__"), or (ii) any fee minerals, reversionary interests, non-participating
royalty interests, executive rights, non-executive rights, royalties, __ and
any other similar interests in Hydrocarbons and minerals in place (excluding
any Fee Mineral Interests) (the " __ _Additional_ ___Fee Mineral Interests_
_,_ " and collectively with the Additional Leases, the " __ _Additional
Interests_ __"), then Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
elect no later than the Option Deadline to sell, and cause Purchaser to
purchase, such Additional Interest on the terms set forth herein (each such
option, an " __ _Additional Interest Option_ __").

 

(b) Subject to _Section 7.23(c)_ below, Seller may exercise each Additional
Interest Option as to each Additional Interest by delivering to Purchaser no
later than the Option Deadline a written notice of exercise of such Additional
Interest Option, which notice shall (i) identify the Additional Interest(s)
that Seller has elected to require Purchaser to purchase, (ii) set forth
Sellers good faith estimate of the number of Net Fee Mineral Acres or Net
Leasehold Mineral Acres, as applicable, covered by each such Additional

Additional Interest Purchase Price attributable to each such Additional
Interest, and (iv) include copies of title abstracts, title information, and
any other supporting documents in Sellers possession that are reasonably
necessary for the Purchaser to verify or confirm Sellers title to each such
Additional Interest.

 

(c) Without Purchasers prior written consent, Seller may not exercise an
Additional Interest Option as to (i) any Additional Lease unless Seller can
deliver at least a fifty percent (50%) Working Interest therein to Purchaser
pursuant to such Additional Interest Option, (ii) any Additional Lease having
a Net Revenue Interest less than the product of (x) seventy-five percent
(75.0%) _multiplied by_ (y) Sellers Working Interest in such Additional
Lease, (iii) any Additional Lease providing for less than a three (3) year
primary term, or (iv) except with respect to the pre-approved Additional
Leases (" __ _Pre-Approved Additional Leases_ __") and Additional Fee Mineral
Interests (" __ _Pre-Approved Additional Fee Mineral Interests_ __")
identified in Parts I and II, respectively, of _Schedule 7.23_ , any
Additional Interest having an Additional Interest Purchase Price greater than
Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00).

(d) In the event that Seller exercises the Additional Interest Option,
then, subject to, (i) such Additional Interests shall be included in and
constitute Leases, or Fee Mineral Interests, as applicable, as of the Closing
Date and (ii) the Purchase Price at Closing shall be increased by the
Additional Interest Purchase Price attributable to all such Additional
Interests.

(e) If Seller does not exercise the Additional Interest Option as to
any Additional Interests by the Option Deadline, then the Additional Interest
Option shall terminate and expire as to any Additional Interests for which
Seller has not exercised the Additional Interest Option by the Option
Deadline, and Purchaser shall have no further rights or obligations hereunder
with respect to such Additional Interests.

 



-77- (f) Seller and Purchaser shall use good faith efforts to agree on the
interpretation and effect of this _Section_ __ _ 7.23_ and the validity and
determination of all Additional Interests and Additional Interest Purchase
Prices with respect thereto. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on
the interpretation and effect of this _Section_ __ _ 7.23_, the existence or
amount of any Additional Interests and Additional Interest Purchase Prices, or
any other matter related to title to the Additional Interests for which Seller
has exercised the Additional Interest Option then all such disputed matters,
interpretations and effect of this this _Section_ __ _ 7.23_ shall be
exclusively and finally resolved by the Title Referee in accordance with the
terms of _Section 3.2(i)_ , _mutatis mutandis_.

Section 7.24 _Tag-Along Rights_.

 

(a) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Seller or the Assets may be bound

with the terms of such Tag-Alongs. Except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _

own Records and (ii) Seller shall not be obligated to make any payments or
undertake obligations to obtain any exercise of Tag-Alongs.

(c) From and after the Execution Date, Purchaser shall comply with the
provisions of any Tag-Alongs set forth on  _Schedule_ __ _ 4.11_ and execute
and deliver all agreements and instruments required to be executed and
delivered by Purchaser under the respective terms of such Tag-Alongs. If prior
to Closing, Purchaser discovers any Tag-Alongs or similar rights that are not
set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 4.11_ and that are applicable to the Assets,
Purchaser shall provide written notice to Seller of such Tag-Alongs, whereupon
_Schedule_ __ _ 4.11_ shall be deemed to be supplemented to add such Tag-
Along and Purchaser and Seller shall promptly thereafter comply with such Tag-
Alongs in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 7.24_.

which would have the same effect, or enter into any Hedge or other arrangement
that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of

Common Stock constituting the Stock Purchase Price or such other securities,
in cash or

 



-78-  otherwise, or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale,

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 10.1 _Asset Taxes_.

 

(a) Seller shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to the
Assets with respect to (i) any Tax period ending prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) the portion of any Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and Purchaser shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes
attributable to the Assets with respect to (x) any Tax period beginning at or
after the Effective Time and (y) the portion of any Straddle Period beginning
at the Effective Time.

(b) For purposes of determining the allocations described in _Section
10.1(a)_ , __ (i) Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance or
production of Hydrocarbons shall be allocated to the period in which the
severance or production giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, (ii) Asset
Taxes that are based upon or related to sales or receipts or imposed on a
transactional basis (other than such Asset Taxes described in clause (i) above
or (iii) below), shall be allocated to the period in which the transaction
giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred,

 



-84-  and (iii) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem, property, or other Asset Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis pertaining to a Straddle Period shall be allocated
between the portion of such Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning at the
Effective Time by prorating each such Asset Tax based on the number of days in
the applicable Straddle Period that occur before the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, on the one hand, and the number of days in such
Straddle Period that occur on or after the date on which the Effective Time
occurs, on the other hand. For purposes of clause (iii) of the preceding
sentence, the period for such Asset Taxes shall begin on the date on which
ownership of the applicable Assets gives rise to liability for the particular
Asset Tax and shall end on the day before the next such date.

 

(c) To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not known at the time
an adjustment is to be made with respect to such Asset Tax pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, as applicable, the Parties shall
utilize the most recent information available in estimating the amount of such
Asset Tax for purposes of such adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of
an Asset Tax (or the amount thereof paid or economically borne by a Party) is
ultimately determined to be different than the amount (if any) that was taken
into account in the final settlement of the Final Purchase Price as finally
determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, timely payments will be made from
one Party to the other to the extent necessary to cause each Party to bear the
amount of such Asset Tax that is allocable to such Party under this _Section_
__ _ 10.1_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Purchaser
becomes entitled, pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)(i)_ , to any amounts earned
from the sale of Hydrocarbons, which amounts are received after the Cut-Off
Date, Purchaser shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to
the production of such Hydrocarbons or the receipt of proceeds therefrom
notwithstanding that such Hydrocarbons were produced prior to the Effective
Time.

 

Section 10.2 _Transfer Taxes and Recording Fees_. Purchaser shall bear and pay
(a) all sales, use, transfer, stamp, documentary, registration, excise, or
similar Taxes incurred or imposed with respect to the transactions described
in this Agreement (" __ _Transfer Taxes_ __"), and (b) all required filing
and recording fees and expenses in connection with the filing and recording
of the assignments, conveyances, or other instruments required to convey title
to the Assets to Purchaser. Seller and Purchaser Parties shall reasonably
cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under
applicable Law, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes.

Section 10.3 _Cooperation_. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes relating to the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and information
that are relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation, or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided under
this Agreement. Seller and Purchaser agree to retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating to any taxable

(a) be responsible for paying any Asset Taxes relating to any Tax period that

respect to such Asset Taxes, (b) submit each such Tax Return to Seller for its
review and comment reasonably in advance of the due date therefor, and (c)
timely file any such Tax Return, incorporating any comments received from
Seller prior to the due date therefor.

applicable, as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.11_, (i) the
representations, warranties, and covenants of each of the Parties set forth

warranty, covenant, or agreement.

 

(e) Each Indemnified Person shall make reasonable efforts to mitigate or all
Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition which would

hereunder; _provided_ , that such Indemnified Person shall not be obligated to
expend any material costs or expenses in order to comply with its
mitigation covenant hereunder, and any costs or expenses incurred in
furtherance of such mitigation covenant shall be considered Damages hereunder.

 



-94- (f) The Parties shall treat, for U.S. federal and applicable state and local
Income Tax purposes, any amounts paid or received under this _Article 12_ as
an adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by
applicable Laws.

 

(g) Except to the extent of claims and rights expressly included as part of
the Assets and as otherwise provided in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement is intended to limit or otherwise waive any recourse that (i) Seller
may have against any Person that is not a member of the Purchaser Group for
any Damages, obligations, or liabilities that may be incurred with respect to
the ownership or operation of the Assets or the Retained Liabilities and (ii)
a Purchaser Party may have against any Person that is not a member of the
Seller Group for any Damages, obligations, or liabilities that may be incurred
with respect to the ownership or operation of the Assets or the Assumed
Obligations; _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Parties acknowledge and agree that no past, present, or future
director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, agent, attorney, representative, Affiliate, or financing source
(including, without limitation, Warburg Pincus LLC, Pine Brook Road Partners,
LLC, Yorktown Energy Partners IX, L.P., and their respective past, present,
or future directors, managers, officers, employees, incorporators, members,
partners, stockholders, agents, attorneys, representatives, Affiliates (other
than any of the Parties or any of their subsidiaries), or financing sources
of any of the Parties to this Agreement (each, a " _Non-Recourse Person_"), in
such capacity, shall have any liability or responsibility (in contract, tort,
or otherwise) for any Damages, suits, legal or administrative proceedings,
claims, demands, losses, costs, obligations, liabilities, interests, charges,
or causes of action whatsoever, in law or in equity, known or unknown, which
are based on, related to, or arise out of the negotiation, performance, and
consummation of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder; _provided, further_ ,
nothing in this proviso shall relieve any Non-Recourse Person for any
liability for any actual and intentional fraud with respect to the making of
any of the representations and warranties under this Agreement, _provided_ ,
that such actual and intentional fraud of such Non-Recourse Person shall only
be deemed to exist if such Non-Recourse Person had actual knowledge (as
opposed to imputed or constructive knowledge) that the representations and
warranties made under this Agreement were actually breached when made, with
the express intention that Purchaser or Purchaser Parent rely thereon to such
Persons detriment. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
dispute, controversy, matter, or claim based on, related to, or arising out of
this Agreement, or the negotiation, performance, or consummation of this
Agreement, may only be brought against the Persons that are expressly named
as Parties, and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth
herein with respect to such Party. Each Non-Recourse Person is expressly
intended as a Third Party beneficiary of this  _Section 12.5(g)_.

(h) To the extent of the indemnification obligations in this Agreement, each
Purchaser Party and Seller hereby waive for themselves and their respective
successors and assigns, including any insurers, any rights to subrogation for
Damages for which such Party is liable or against which such Party indemnifies
any other Person under this Agreement. If required by applicable insurance
policies, each Party shall obtain a waiver of such subrogation from its
insurers.

 



-95- (i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the rights of each member
of the Purchaser Group to indemnification (and Sellers obligations) under
_Section 12.3(d_ ) (as limited by the terms hereof) shall be satisfied _first_
(A) from the balance of the Holdback Shares until the entirety of the Holdback
Shares have been disbursed and _second_ (B) by Seller.

Section 12.6 _Indemnification Actions_. All claims for indemnification under
_Article 12_ shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this _Article 12_ , the term " _Indemnifying Party_ "
when used in connection with particular Damages means (i) Seller in the event
any member of the Purchaser Group is entitled to indemnity from Seller or
reimbursement from the balance of the Holdback Shares (as applicable) under
_Section_ __ _ 12.3_ and (ii) Purchaser in the event any member of the Seller
Group is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement. For purposes of
this _Article 12_ , the term " _Indemnified Person_ " when used in connection
with particular Damages means (i) Purchaser in the event any member of the
Purchaser Group is entitled to indemnity from Seller or reimbursement from the
balance of the Holdback Shares (as applicable) under _Section_ __ _ 12.3_
and (ii) Seller in the event any member of the Seller Group is entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement.

 

(b) To make a claim for indemnification, defense or reimbursement under this
_Article 12_ , an Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Party of
its claim, including the specifics thereof in reasonable detail (including,
where reasonably available, supporting documentation of the alleged Damages
and such Indemnified Persons good faith estimate of the applicable claim) of
and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the " _Claim Notice_
").

(c) In the event that any claim for indemnification set forth in any Claim
Notice is based upon a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified Person
(a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim
Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the
Third Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with
respect to the Third Party Claim; _provided_ that the failure of any
Indemnified Person to give notice of any Third Party Claim as provided in
this _Section_ __ _ 12.6_ shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this _Article 12_ except to the extent (and only to the
extent) such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit
the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Third Party Claim or
otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend
against the Third Party Claim. In the event that the claim
for indemnification is based upon an alleged inaccuracy or breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement, the Claim Notice shall
specify the representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement that was
allegedly inaccurate or breached.

 

(d) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies
(i) in the case of Seller, Purchasers right to indemnity from Seller or
reimbursement against the balance of the Holdback Shares (as applicable) in
respect of such Third Party Claim as provided in this _Article 12_ or (ii) in
the case of Purchaser, its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against
such Third Party Claim under this _Article 12_. The Indemnified Person
is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30)

 



-96-  day period, to file any motion, answer, or other pleading that it shall deem
necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying
Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty
(30) day period regarding whether the Indemnifying Party admits or denies (i)
in the case of Seller, Purchasers right to indemnity from Seller or
reimbursement against the balance of the Holdback Shares (as applicable) in
respect of such Third Party Claim as provided in this _Article 12_ or (ii) in
the case of Purchaser, its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person
against such Third Party Claim under this _Article 12_ , then until such date
as the Indemnifying Party admits or it is finally determined by a non-
appealable judgment that such right or obligation exists, the Indemnified
Person may file any motion, answer, or other pleading, settle any Third Party
Claim or take any other action that the Indemnified Person deems necessary or
appropriate to protect its interest, regardless of whether the Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced or adversely impacted by any such actions.

(e) If (x) Seller admits Purchasers right to indemnity from Seller or
reimbursement against the balance of the Holdback Shares (as applicable) in
respect of such Third Party Claim as provided in this _Article 12_ or (y)
Purchaser admits its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such
Third Party Claim under this _Article 12_ , as applicable, then the applicable
Indemnifying Party shall have the right and obligation to diligently prosecute
and control the defense such Third Party Claim, subject to the conditions on
compromise or settlement set forth below, and if Purchaser is the Indemnifying
Party, at the sole cost and expense of Purchaser, and if Seller is the
Indemnifying Party, at the sole cost and expense of _first_ , the balance of
the Holdback Shares, and, only if Purchaser is entitled to indemnity from
Seller for the Third Party Claim, _second_ , of Seller; provided, however,
that the Indemnifying Party shall in no event have the right to defend against
any Third Party Claim if such Third Party Claim (i) relates to any criminal
allegation or proceeding, (ii) seeks an injunction or non-monetary or
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, or (iii) seeks
monetary damages in an amount in excess of the then remaining Holdback
Shares. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Person agrees
at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party to cooperate in contesting
any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to
bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person. The Indemnified
Person may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any
Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
_Section 12.6(e)_ provided that the Indemnified Person may file initial
pleadings as described in the last sentence of subsection (d) above if
required by court or procedural rules to do so within the thirty (30) day
period in subsection (d) above. An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the
written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any Third Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto that (A) does not
result in a final resolution of the Indemnified Persons liability with
respect to the Third Party Claim (including, in the case of a settlement,
an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Person from all further
liability in respect of such Third Party Claim), (B) requires the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates to perform any covenant (other than payment of
money damages covered by the indemnity) or refrain from engaging in any
activity, or (C) may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Person
(other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

 



-97- (f) Except to the extent an Indemnifying Party is entitled to control the
defense of a Third Party Claim as set forth above, then the Indemnified
Person shall have the right, but not the obligation, to defend and control the
defense against the Third Party Claim (if Purchaser is the Indemnifying Party,
at the sole cost and expense of Purchaser, and if Seller is the Indemnifying
Party, at the sole cost and expense of _first_ , the balance of the Holdback
Shares, and, only if Purchaser is entitled to indemnity from Seller for the
Third Party Claim, _second_ , of Seller, and in either case if the
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of
the Indemnified Persons choosing, subject to the right of (x) Seller as the
Indemnifying Party to admit Purchasers right to indemnity from Seller or
reimbursement against the balance of the Holdback Shares (as applicable) in
respect of such Third Party Claim as provided in this _Article 12_ or (y)
Purchaser as the Indemnifying Party to admit its obligation to defend the
Indemnified Person against such Third Party Claim under this _Article 12_ , as
applicable, at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If
(x) Seller has not yet admitted Purchasers right to indemnity from Seller or
reimbursement against the balance of the Holdback Shares (as applicable) in
respect of such Third Party Claim as provided in this _Article 12_ or (y)
Purchaser has not yet admitted its obligation to defend the
Indemnified Person against such Third Party Claim under this _Article 12_ ,
as applicable, the Indemnified Person shall send written notice to the
Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall
have the option for ten (10) days following receipt of such notice to (i) (x)
in the case of Seller, admit Purchasers right to indemnity from Seller or
reimbursement against the balance of the Holdback Shares (as applicable) in
respect of such Third Party Claim as provided in this _Article 12_ or (y) in
the case of Purchaser, admit its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person
against such Third Party Claim under this _Article 12_ , as applicable, and
(ii) if such right or obligation is so admitted, assume the defense of the
Third Party Claim, including the power to reject the proposed settlement. If
the Indemnified Person settles any Third Party Claim over the objection of the
Indemnifying Party after the Indemnifying Party has timely admitted such
right or obligation for indemnification in writing and assumed the defense of
the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived
any right to indemnity with respect to the Third Party Claim.

(g) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim (a " __ _Direct Claim_ __"), such Direct Claim shall be asserted by
giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt Claim Notice thereof, but in
any event not later than thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Person
becomes aware of the events that gave rise to such Direct Claim. Such Claim
Notice by the Indemnified Person shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all available material written evidence
thereof, and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable,
of Damages that have been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Person. The
Indemnifying Party shall have sixty (60) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) (x) in the case of Seller,
admit Purchasers right to indemnity from Seller or reimbursement against the
balance of the Holdback Shares (as applicable) in respect of such Direct Claim
as provided in this _Article 12_ or (y) in the case of Purchaser, admit its
obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Direct Claim under
this _Article 12_ , as applicable, or (iii) dispute the claim for such
Damages. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Person
within such sixty (60) day period that it has cured the Damages or that it
disputes the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be
conclusively deemed (x) in the case of Seller, to have admitted Purchasers
right to indemnity from Seller or reimbursement against the balance of the
Holdback Shares (as applicable) in respect of such Direct Claim as provided in
this _Article 12_ or (y) in the case of Purchaser, to have admitted its
obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Direct Claim under
this _Article 12_ , as applicable.

 



-98- (h) From and after Closing, each Party agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the other Parties in connection with each Partys
defense and other actions relating to or arising out of any matters for with
such Party is required to indemnify any Person hereunder.

(a) If the Closing occurs, the Holdback Shares shall be deposited with the
Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ and held by the Escrow Agent in
escrow in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. If at any time on or prior to the Holdback Deadline Purchaser
delivers to Seller and the Escrow Agent a Claim Notice that Purchaser is
entitled under  _Section_ __ _ 12.3_ to indemnity, payment, and
reimbursement from the balance of the Holdback Shares for any alleged Damages,
Seller shall, within thirty (30) days after the receipt of any such Claim
Notice, at its option either deliver to Purchaser and the Escrow Agent (i)
written instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to Purchaser a
number of Holdback Shares then deposited with the Escrow Agent equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (A) an amount equal to all or a stipulated
amount of such alleged Damages set forth in such Claim Notice to such
account(s) as Purchaser designates in such Claim Notice by (B) the Share
Price, (ii) a notice that Seller disputes that the members of the Purchaser
Group are entitled to indemnity, payment, and reimbursement of all or any
portion (which shall be stipulated in Sellers notice) of the amount of the
alleged Damages in Purchasers Claim Notice, or (iii) any combination of the
foregoing. Failure of Seller to deliver a notice or the timely delivery of
Sellers notice stipulating that Seller disputes any portion of the amount of
Damages to which Purchaser claims the member of the Purchaser Group are
entitled shall constitute or be deemed to constitute notice that such amount
in dispute shall not be released by the Escrow Agent to Purchaser and that the
Escrow Agent shall continue to hold the applicable Holdback Shares until the
dispute has been fully resolved by final non-appealable court order,
arbitrators decision, settlement, or otherwise.

 

(b) If Seller either (i) timely delivers to Purchaser and the Escrow Agent a
notice that Seller does not dispute any of the alleged Damages specified in
Purchasers Claim Notice, or (ii) timely delivers a notice that it disputes
only a portion of the Damages alleged in Purchasers Claim Notice, then (A) in
the case of subpart (i) of this _Section 12.7(b)_ , Seller shall be deemed to
have authorized the Escrow Agent to disburse to Purchaser a number of Holdback
Shares (together with any dividends, distributions, earnings or other amounts
accrued thereon) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the entire
amount of the alleged Damages specified in the applicable Claim Notice by (y)
the Share Price and (B) in the case of subpart (ii) of this _Section 12.7(b)_
, Seller shall be deemed to have authorized the Escrow Agent to disburse to
Purchaser a number of Holdback Shares equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (x) the amount of the alleged Damages specified in such Sellers
notice that are not in dispute by (y) the Share Price. 

 



-99- (c) Promptly after the date that is six (6) months after the Closing Date (but
in no event more than three (3) Business Days thereafter), Purchaser and
Seller shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to Seller, an amount of
Holdback Shares equal to positive amount, if any, of (i) Five Hundred
Seventy-Six Thousand Five Hundred and One (576,501) shares of Common Stock
(together with any dividends, distributions, earnings or other amounts accrued
thereon) minus (y) a number of Holdback Shares equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing (A) all undisbursed or unpaid alleged Damages required to be
disbursed to Purchaser or required to be retained by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with _Section 12.7(b)_ by (B) the Share Price; it being
understood, that the Escrow Agent shall retain at least Five Hundred Seventy-
Six Thousand Five Hundred and One (576,501) shares of Common Stock following
the disbursement to Seller contemplated above.

(d) Promptly after the Holdback Deadline (but in no event more than three (3)
Business Days thereafter), Purchaser and Seller shall execute and deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse to Seller, an amount of Holdback Shares equal to the positive amount,
if any, of (i) the remainder of the Holdback Shares (together with any
dividends, distributions, earnings or other amounts accrued thereon) minus (y)
a number of Holdback Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) all
undisbursed or unpaid alleged Damages required to be disbursed to Purchaser
or required to be retained by the Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section
12.7(b)_ by (B) the Share Price. Upon resolution of each such dispute, the
Parties shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent for the release (1) to Purchaser a number of Holdback Shares (together
with any dividends, distributions, earnings or other amounts accrued thereon)
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) any amounts to which Purchaser
is entitled upon resolution of such dispute by (y) the Share Price and (2) to
Seller a number of Holdback Shares (together with any dividends,
distributions, earnings or other amounts accrued thereon) equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (x) all remaining amounts subject to such
dispute by (y) the Share Price; _provided_ , that the Escrow Agent shall at
all times retain a number of Holdback Shares equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing (x) the aggregate amount of all undisbursed or unpaid alleged
Damages required to be disbursed to Purchaser or required to be retained by
Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 12.7(b)_ by (y) the Share Price.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _
12.7_, if at any time Purchaser is entitled to receipt of any Holdback Shares
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 12.7_, Seller may elect, at its sole
option, to pay to Purchaser the amount of Damages to which Purchaser is
entitled under this _Article 12_ by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such account(s) as Purchaser designates in such Claim Notice (in lieu
of Purchasers receipt of such Holdback Shares), in which event (i) such
Holdback Shares shall be not be released from the escrow account to Purchaser
and (ii) the Parties shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent for the release to Seller of a number of Holdback Shares
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the amount of such Damages by
(y) the Share Price.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no fractional
Holdback Shares shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 12.7_ or the Escrow Agreement. In lieu of the disbursement of
any such fractional Holdback Share, the Party owing the obligation in respect
of which any such fractional Holdback Share would otherwise be released shall
make payment to the Person to whom such fractional Holdback Share would
otherwise be disbursed in cash in an amount determined by _multiplying_ (I)
the Share Price by (II) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest
hundredth when expressed in decimal form) of Holdback Share such Person would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant hereto.

in relation to or in connection with the calculation or determination of the
Purchase Price pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, _Section_ __ _ 2.5_,
_Section_ __ _ 2.6_, _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, or _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ (which

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
LITIGATION, ACTION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT.

 

Section 13.4 _Headings and Construction_. The headings and captions herein are
inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to govern,
limit, or aid in the construction of any term or provision hereof. The rights
and obligations of each Party shall be determined pursuant to this Agreement.
Seller and each Purchaser Party have each had the opportunity to exercise
business discretion in relation to the negotiation of the details and terms of
the transaction contemplated hereby. This Agreement is the result of arms
length negotiations from equal bargaining positions. It is the intention of
the Parties that every covenant, term, and provision of this Agreement shall
be construed simply according to its fair meaning and not strictly for or
against any Party (notwithstanding any rule of Law requiring an agreement to
be strictly construed against the drafting Party) and no consideration shall
be given or presumption made, on the basis of who drafted this Agreement or
any particular provision thereof, it being understood that the Parties to this
Agreement are sophisticated and have had adequate opportunity and means to
exercise business discretion in relation to the negotiation of the details of
the transaction contemplated hereby and retain counsel to represent their
interests and to otherwise negotiate the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 13.5 _Waivers_. Any failure by any Party to comply with any of its
obligations, agreements, or conditions herein contained may be waived by the
Party to whom such compliance is owed by the application of the express terms
hereof by an instrument signed by the Party to whom compliance is owed and
expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any other

 



-103-  manner. No course of dealing on the part of any Party or its respective
officers, employees, agents, or representatives and no failure by any Party to
exercise any of its rights under this Agreement shall, in each case, operate
as a waiver thereof or affect in any way the right of such Party at a later
time to enforce the performance of such provision. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, no waiver of, or consent to a change in or
modification of, any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or
shall constitute a waiver of, or consent to a change in or modification of,
other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver
constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided herein.
The rights of each Party under this Agreement shall be cumulative and the
exercise or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude the exercise
by such Party of any other right. 

Section 13.6 _Severability_. It is the intent of the Parties that the
provisions contained in this Agreement shall be severable and should any
terms or provisions, in whole or in part, be held invalid, illegal, or
incapable of being enforced as a matter of Law, such holding shall not affect
the other portions of this Agreement, and such portions that are not invalid
shall be given effect without the invalid portion. Upon such determination
that any term or provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 13.7 _Assignment_. No Party shall assign or otherwise transfer all or
any part of this Agreement, nor shall any Party delegate any of its rights or
duties hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other Party and any
transfer or delegation made without such consent shall be null and void;
_provided, however_ , Purchaser may assign this Agreement, in whole or in
part, to a Permitted Assignee upon Sellers prior written consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Unless expressly agreed to in writing
by the Parties, no permitted assignment of any Partys rights or duties shall
relieve or release the assigning Party from the performance of such Partys
rights or obligations hereunder and such assigning Party shall be fully liable
to the other Party for the performance of all such rights and duties. To the
extent any Purchaser Party directly or indirectly assigns, transfers,
conveys, or otherwise disposes, by operation of Law, merger, consolidation,
change of control, or disposition of equity interests or otherwise, of all or
any interests in any of the Assets, each Person receiving such interest
shall, and each Purchaser Party shall cause each such Person, to assume in
writing and the applicable Purchaser Party and such Person(s) shall be jointly
and severally liable hereunder to Seller with respect to the Assumed
Obligations arising out of or attributable to such Assets. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns. 

Section 13.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents constitute the entire agreement between the Parties pertaining to
the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN
THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF
ANY SCHEDULE OR EXHIBIT HERETO, THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL GOVERN AND CONTROL; _PROVIDED , HOWEVER_ THAT THE INCLUSION IN ANY OF
THE SCHEDULES AND EXHIBITS HERETO OF TERMS AND PROVISIONS NOT ADDRESSED
IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A CONFLICT, AND ALL SUCH ADDITIONAL
PROVISIONS SHALL BE GIVEN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT, SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF
THIS _S ECTION_ __ __ _ 13.8_.

 



-104- Section 13.9 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by
an agreement in writing signed by Seller and each Purchaser Party that
expressly references this Agreement.

Section 13.10 _No Third-Person Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement
shall entitle any Person other than the Purchaser Parties and Seller to any
claim, cause of action, remedy, or right of any kind, except the rights
expressly provided to the Persons described in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_,
_Section_ __ _ 7.13_, _Section_ __ _ 7.14_, and _Article 12_ (including
_Section 12.5(g)_ ), in each case, only to the extent such rights are
exercised or pursued, if at all, by Seller or any Purchaser Party acting on
behalf of such Person (which rights may be exercised in the sole discretion of
the applicable Party hereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) the
Parties reserve the right to amend, modify, terminate, supplement, or waive
any provision of this Agreement or this entire Agreement without the consent
or approval of any other Person (including any Indemnified Person) and (b) no
Party hereunder shall have any direct liability to any permitted Third Party
beneficiary, nor shall any permitted Third Party beneficiary have any right to
exercise any rights hereunder for such Third Party beneficiarys benefit
except to the extent such rights are brought, exercised, and administered by
a Party hereto in accordance with _Section 12.5(b)_.

Section 13.11 _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, NO PERSON SHALL BE ENTITLED TO LOST PROFITS, LOSS
OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY AND EACH OF THE PURCHASER PARTIES AND SELLER, FOR ITSELF AND ON
BEHALF OF THEIR RESPECTIVE MEMBERS OF THE PURCHASER GROUP AND SELLER
GROUP, RESPECTIVELY, HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO LOST PROFITS,
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, other than (a)
consequential damages or punitive damages suffered by any Third Party for
which responsibility is allocated among the Parties under the terms hereof
and (b) any liability, loss, damages, cost, costs of collection settlement and
enforcement, expense, claim, award, or judgment of any member of the Seller
Group constituting, related to, or arising out of diminution in value of the
Stock Purchase Price to the extent resulting from any breach of
representation, warranty, or covenant of any Purchaser Party relating to the
Purchaser Parent or the Stock Purchase Price.

 

Section 13.12 _Deceptive Trade Practices Act_. Each Purchaser Party certifies
that it is not a "consumer" within the meaning of the Texas Deceptive Trade
Practices Consumer Protection Act, Subchapter E of Chapter 17, Sections 17.41,
_et seq._ , of the Texas Business and Commerce Code, (as amended, the " __
_DTPA_ __"). Purchaser covenants, for itself and for and on behalf of any
successor or assignee, that if the DTPA is applicable to this Agreement, (a)
Purchaser is a "business consumer" as that term is defined in the DTPA, (b)
AFTER CONSULTATION WITH ATTORNEYS OF PURCHASER PARTIES OWN
SELECTION, PURCHASER PARTIES HEREBY VOLUNTARILY WAIVE AND RELEASE ALL OF
PURCHASER PARTIES RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UNDER THE DTPA AS APPLICABLE TO SELLER
AND SELLERS SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, AND (C) EACH PURCHASER PARTY
SHALL DEFEND AND INDEMNIFY THE SELLER

essence in this Agreement. If the date specified in this Agreement for giving
any notice or taking any action is not a Business Day (or if the period during
which any notice is required to be given or any action taken expires on a
date that is not a Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or
taking such action (and the expiration date of such period during which notice
is required to be given or action taken) shall be the next Business Day.

Section 13.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which

other electronic transmission of copies of signatures shall constitute
