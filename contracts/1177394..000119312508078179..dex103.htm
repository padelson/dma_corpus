ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

THIS ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of February 25,
2008, by and among SYNNEX Corporation, a Delaware corporation or its assigns
(" _Acquirer_ ") and New Age Electronics, Inc., a California corporation (the
" _Company_ "). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have
the meanings set forth in Article 10\.

RECITALS:

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company desires to
sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to Acquirer, and Acquirer
desires to purchase and acquire from the Company, all of Companys right,
title and interest in and to all of the Purchased Assets (the " _Acquisition_
")

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises, representations
and warranties set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration
(the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by the
parties), intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

PURCHASE and SALE OF PURCHASED ASSETS

1.1  _Purchased Assets_. At the Closing, the Company shall sell, convey,
transfer, assign and deliver to Acquirer, and Acquirer shall purchase and
acquire from the Company, free and clear of all Liens (except for Permitted
Liens), all of the Companys right, title and interest in and to
substantially all of the assets (collectively, the " _Purchased Assets_ ")
which the Company owns or in which the Company has any right, title or
interest other than those set forth on  _Exhibit A_.

1.2 _No Other Assets_. The Company shall only retain, and Acquirer shall not
purchase, the assets listed on  _Exhibit A_ (the " _Excluded Assets_ ").

1.3 _Assumption of Liabilities_.

(a) Except as provided in Section 1.3(b), the Company shall retain, and
Acquirer shall not assume, or be responsible or liable with respect to,
any liabilities or obligations of the Company (the " _Retained Liabilities_
," which, in any case, shall include the items set forth on _Exhibit A-1_ and
all liabilities and obligations, other than any and all payments of interest
and principal outstanding at Closing, under that certain Second Amended and
Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of September 19, 2006, by and
among the Company and the lenders named therein and related notes, guarantees
and security agreements, as amended).

(b) Acquirer shall assume, at the Closing and effective as of the Closing
Date, and shall thereafter pay, perform and discharge as and when due:

(i) Those liabilities and obligations of Acquirer to the extent reflected on
the Interim Financials, relating to the Business as such liabilities and
obligations exist on the Closing Date;



 

-1- (ii) Those liabilities and obligations of the Company that arise in the
ordinary course of business after the date of the Interim Financials relating
to the Business and existing at the close of business on the Closing Date;

(iii) All liabilities and obligations of the Company arising under the
assumed Contracts after the Closing Date except to the extent any such
liability or obligation arises in connection with a breach of a representation
or warranty made by the Company in Article 2 herein in respect of an assumed
Contract;

(iv) All liabilities and obligations of the Company under its Warranty
Obligations; 

(v) All liabilities and obligations of the Company under the Second Amended
and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of September 19, 2006, by
and among New Age Electronics, Inc. and the lenders named therein; and

(vi) Those liabilities and obligations of the Company set forth on _Exhibit
B_ attached hereto (Sections 1.3(b)(i) through (vi), collectively, the "
_Assumed Liabilities_ ").

1.4 _Purchase Price; Payment of Purchase Price_.

(a) Final Purchase Price.

(i) The aggregate consideration for the Purchased Assets and the Companys
Business related thereto shall be Forty-Three Million Two Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($43,250,000) (the " _Base Payment_ "), plus or minus
the Final Tangible Net Worth Adjustment and plus any Earn-Out Payment earned
pursuant to the Earn Out Agreement (collectively with all paid installments of
the Base Payment, as adjusted by the Final Tangible Net Worth Adjustment, the
" _Final Purchase Price_ ").

(ii) The Base Payment will be adjusted either up or down by the amount by
which the Tangible Net Worth of the Company as of the Closing exceeds or falls
short of the following targets: if the Closing occurs on or before February
29, 2008, $15,333,982, and for each day after February 29 and before April 1,
2008 the target shall increase by $4,933 (the " _Target Tangible Net Worth_
"). If the Closing occurs after March 31, 2008, the Target Tangible Net Worth
will thereafter remain fixed at $15,486,909; provided, however, that if the
Closing has not occurred by April 1, 2008 as a result of (A) the Company not
having completed the 2007 Financials, (B) the Companys failure to deliver a
pay-off letter (the " _Pay-Off Letter_ ") in respect of that certain Second
Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of September 19,
2006, by and among the Company and the lenders named therein to the Acquirer,
(C) assuming payment by Acquirer of the amounts set forth in the Pay-Off
Letter, the Companys failure to deliver the Bank UCC Release or (D) the
Companys failure to timely fulfill the Company HSR Delivery Requirements, for
each day after March 31, 2008, the Target Tangible Net Worth shall increase
by $17,404 per day until April 30, 2008.



 

-2- (iii) The Base Payment less the Holdback Amount, shall be paid by Acquirer to
the Company at the Closing, and such payment shall be made via wire transfer
of immediately available funds from Acquirer to an account specified by the
Company. The wire instruction details for such account shall be provided to
Acquirer no less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing.

(iv) Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($8,500,000) of the Base
Payment will be paid by the Acquirer to the Company on such date that is one
hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, subject to any post-closing
purchase price adjustments made pursuant to Section 1.4(b).

(v) The final Three Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($3,250,000) of
the Base Payment shall be paid by the Acquirer to the Company on such
date that is one hundred eighty days (180) days after the Closing Date,
subject to any post-closing purchase price adjustments made pursuant to
Section 1.4(b).

(b) Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment.

(i) Not later than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after the Closing
Date, Acquirer will, or will cause its independent accounting firm ("
_Accountants_ ") to, prepare and deliver to the Company a statement (the "
_Statement_ ") setting forth the Tangible Net Worth of the Business as of the
Closing Date, and the components and calculations thereof, including, but not
limited to, appropriate reserves for accounts receivable, amounts due from and
owing under vendor programs, and inventory (each, an " _At Risk Item_ ") (the
" _Closing Date Tangible Net Worth_ "), in each case determined in accordance
with the Accounting Procedures. If during any fiscal quarter, Acquirer
collects on or removes the reserve from any At Risk Item such that Acquirer
benefits financially from the At Risk Item in excess of such item net of the
reserve therefore, Acquirer shall promptly pay to the Company an amount equal
to such excess benefit.

(ii) If the Company has any objections to the calculation of the Closing Date
Tangible Net Worth as set forth on the Statement, the Company will deliver a
detailed statement (the " _Statement of Objections_ ") describing the
Companys objections to Acquirer within thirty (30) calendar days of the
Companys receipt of the Statement from Acquirer; provided, however, that
if Acquirer makes an adjustment for an At Risk Item, the Company shall have
thirty (30) calendar days from the Companys receipt thereof to deliver a
Statement of Objections, notwithstanding whether it has delivered a Statement
of Objections in response to the Statement. If the Company fails to notify
Acquirer of any such objections within such thirty-calendar-day period, the
Statement delivered to the Company will be deemed to be the " _Final
Statement_ ". The Company and Acquirer will use their reasonable best efforts
to resolve any such objections.

(iii) If a final resolution is not obtained within thirty (30) calendar days
after Acquirer has received the Statement of Objections, Acquirer and the
Company will mutually appoint an accounting firm (such accounting firm, the "
_Accounting Referee_ ") to resolve any remaining objections, determined in
accordance with the Accounting Procedures. The Accounting Referee will address
only items disputed by the parties, and may not assign to any such disputed
item a value that is greater than the greatest amount for such item that
is claimed by a party or less than the smallest amount claimed by a party.
Each party will cooperate with the Accounting Referee and provide the
Accounting Referee with any information requested by it. The decision of the
Accounting Referee will be final and binding on all parties.



 

-3- (iv) Acquirer will revise the Statement as appropriate to reflect the
resolution of the Companys objections (as agreed upon by the Company and
Acquirer or as determined by the Accounting Referee) and deliver it to the
Company within fifteen (15) calendar days after the resolution of such
objections. Such revised Statement will be the " _Final Statement_." The
Tangible Net Worth of the Business set forth on the Final Statement will be
the " _Final Tangible Net Worth_ ".

(v) If Acquirer and the Company fail to select the Accounting Referee as
required by Section 1.4(b)(iii) within ten (10) Business Days after the
expiration of the 30-calendar day negotiation periods described therein, the
Company and Acquirer may resolve any remaining objections set forth in the
Statement of Objections in accordance with Section 9.8.

(vi) Except as provided in Section 1.4(b)(vii), Acquirer and the Company shall
bear equally the fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee and the fees of
any arbitrators appointed to resolve disputes under this Section 1.4(b).

(vii) The Accounting Referee shall be required by the parties to determine the
party (i.e., Acquirer or the Company) whose asserted position as to the
calculation of Closing Date Tangible Net Worth is furthest from the
determination by the Accounting Referee and such party shall be deemed to be
the "non-prevailing party." Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in
Section 1.4(b)(vi), if Acquirer is the non-prevailing party and its asserted
position was lower by 10% or more of the Final Tangible Net Worth as
determined by the Accounting Referee, Acquirer will pay all of the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Referee and any arbitrators appointed to resolve
disputes under this Section 1.4(b). Notwithstanding the provisions set forth
in Section 1.4(b)(vi), if the Company is the non-prevailing party and its
asserted position was higher by 10% or more of the Final Tangible Net Worth
as determined by the Accounting Referee, the Company will pay all of the fees
and expenses of the Accounting Referee and any arbitrators appointed to
resolve disputes under this Section 1.4(b).

(viii) Each party will (A) provide the other party and its representatives
with full access during customary business hours to those books, records and
employees that are related to the preparation of Closing Date Tangible Net
Worth and (B) fully cooperate with all reasonable requests by a party in
connection with a partys review of the Closing Date Tangible Net Worth, the
Statement and the Statement of Objections. Acquirer and the Company will make
available to the other party and its representatives (including auditors) any
back-up materials generated by them to support a position which is contrary
to the position taken by the other party.

(ix) The " _Final Closing Purchase Price_ " will be the amount equal to all
paid installments of the Base Payment (A) plus the amount, if any, by which
the Final Tangible Net Worth exceeds the Target Tangible Net Worth, or (B)
less the amount, if any, by which the Target Tangible Net Worth exceeds the
Final Tangible Net Worth (the amount resulting from the adjustment, if any,
caused by (A) or (B) above, the " _Final Tangible Net Worth Adjustment_ ").

  

 

-4- (x) In the event that the Final Closing Purchase Price, as determined in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.4,

(A) is greater than all paid installments of the Base Payment, Acquirer will
pay to the Company an amount equal to (i) the Final Closing Purchase Price,
less (ii) all paid installments of the Base Payment, via wire transfer of
immediately available funds from Acquirer to the account specified by the
Company pursuant to Section 1.4(a)(iii), not later than three Business Days
after a Statement is deemed a Final Statement; or

(B) is less than all paid installments of the Base Payment, the Company will
pay to Acquirer an amount equal to (i) all paid installments of the Base
Payment, less (ii) the Final Closing Purchase Price, via wire transfer of
immediately available funds, not later than three Business Days after a
Statement is deemed a Final Statement.

1.5 _Closing_. The consummation of the purchase and sale of the Purchased
Assets in accordance with this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at 10:00 a.m., California time, at the offices of Jones Day, 555 S. Flower
Street, Los Angeles, California 90071, on the third (3rd) Business Day after
all of the conditions precedent to Closing hereunder shall have been satisfied
or waived, or at such other date, time and place as the Company and Acquirer
shall mutually agree upon. The date of the Closing shall be referred to as the
" _Closing Date_." The Company and Acquirer hereby agree to deliver at the
Closing such documents, certificates of officers and other instruments as are
set forth in Article 7 hereof and as may reasonably be required to effect the
transfer by the Company of the Purchased Assets pursuant to and as
contemplated by this Agreement and to consummate the Acquisition. All events
which shall occur at the Closing shall be deemed to occur simultaneously.

1.6 _Transfer Taxes_. Acquirer shall be responsible for the payment of any
sales, use, transfer or similar taxes arising out of or in connection with the
Acquisition.

ARTICLE 2

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Subject to the exceptions set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Acquirer as follows. Any exception to
or disclosure in respect of any representation, warranty or covenant, and any
other information, which is disclosed in one section of the Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to have been disclosed in every other section of the
Disclosure Schedule only to the extent it is reasonably apparent that such
exception is applicable to such other representation, warranty or covenant.
Neither Acquirer nor any Affiliate of Acquirer has been given, or has relied
upon or been induced to enter into this Agreement by any representation or
warranty, express or implied, other than as expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

2.1 _Organization and Qualification_.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, and each
has full corporate power and authority to (i) conduct its Business as now
conducted, (ii) to own, use, license and  



 

-5-  lease its Assets and Properties, and (iii) to perform its obligations under
all Contracts to which it is a party. The Company is duly qualified, licensed
or admitted to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction in which the ownership, use, licensing or leasing of its
Assets and Properties, or the conduct or nature of its business, makes
such qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except for such
failures to be so duly qualified, licensed or admitted and in good standing
that could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Business or condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company. _Section 2.1_
of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth each jurisdiction where the Company is
so qualified, licensed or admitted to do business and separately lists each
other jurisdiction in which the Company owns, uses, licenses or leases its
Assets and Properties, or conducts business or has employees or engages
independent contractors.

(b) The Company has never conducted any business under or otherwise used, for
any purpose or in any jurisdiction, any fictitious name, assumed name, trade
name or other name.

(c) Other than as listed on _Section 2.1(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the
Company has no subsidiaries, whether directly or indirectly, and owns no
shares of capital stock or any other ownership interest in any Person, and the
Company is not a partner (general or limited), joint venturer or participant
in any partnership, joint venture or other corporate entity.

2.2 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. The Company has full corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the
other agreements which are attached (or forms of which are attached) as
exhibits hereto (the " _Ancillary Agreements_ ") to which the Company is a
party, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which the Company is a party have been or will be, as
applicable, duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof (and, in the
case of the Ancillary Agreements to which Acquirer is a party, thereof) by
Acquirer, each constitutes or will constitute, as applicable, a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its respective terms, except as the enforceability thereof may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws relating to the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity.

2.3 _Equity Ownership_. _Section 2.3_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a list of all of the holders of capital stock of the Company, indicating the
name of shareholder and the number of shares of capital stock such shareholder
owns. The list set forth at _Section 2.3_ of the Disclosure
Schedule represents 100% of the outstanding equity of the Company. Other than
as set forth on _Section 2.3_ of the Disclosure Schedule, there exists no:
(i) outstanding subscription, option, call, warrant or right (whether or not
currently exercisable) to acquire any equity interest in the Company; or (ii)
outstanding security, instrument or obligation that is or may become
convertible into or exchangeable for any equity interest in the Company.

2.4 _Company Financial Statements_.

(a) The audited financial statements of the Company at and for the periods
ended December 31, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, including the notes therein (the
" _Audited_  



 

-6-   _Financials_ "), and Interim Financials (the Interim Financials,
collectively, with the Audited Financials, the " _Company Financials_ "),
which statements are attached hereto as _Section 2.4(a)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis
consistent throughout the periods indicated and consistent with each other
(except that the unaudited financial statements do not contain footnotes and
are subject to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments). The Company
Financials present fairly and accurately, in all material respects, the
financial condition and operating results of the Company as of the dates and
during the periods indicated therein.

(b) The Company has established and documented, and maintains, adheres to and
enforces a system of internal accounting controls which are effective in
providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements (including the Company
Financials), including policies and procedures that (a) require the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (b) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of true and correct financial statements, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
appropriate authorizations of management and the Board of Directors of the
Company and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the
Company. Neither the management of the Company nor the Companys independent
auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant deficiency
or material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls utilized by
the Company, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves the
Company management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of
financial statements or the internal accounting controls utilized by the
Company or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

2.5 _Books and Records; Organizational Documents_. The minute books and stock
record books and other similar records of the Company have been provided or
made available to Acquirer or its counsel prior to the execution of this
Agreement, are complete and correct in all material respects and have been
maintained in accordance with the sound and prudent business practices
customary for closely held entities. Such minute books contain a true and
complete record of all actions taken at all meetings and by all written
consents in lieu of meetings of the directors, shareholders and committees of
the board of directors of the Company from the date of the Companys
organization through the date hereof. The Company has prior to the execution
of this Agreement delivered to Acquirer true and complete copies of its
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, both as amended through the date
hereof. The Company is not in violation of any provisions of its Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws.

2.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as reflected or reserved against in

Company or Acquirer, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any

the party receiving such notice.

be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

5.8 _Termination of 401(k) Plans_.

(a) Unless Acquirer requests otherwise in writing, the board of directors of
the Company shall adopt resolutions terminating, effective as of the day prior

Company. At the Closing, the Company shall provide Acquirer (a) executed
resolutions of the board of directors of the Company authorizing such
termination and (b) an executed amendment to the 401(k) Plan sufficient to
assure compliance with all applicable requirements of the Code and regulations
thereunder so that the tax-qualified status of the 401(k) Plan will be

(b) Following the Closing Date, Acquirer shall provide the Company with any
records in Acquirers possession that the Company requests to effectuate the
termination of the Companys 401(k) Plan and distribute participant balances
from the plan, except where provision of such records would be in violation of
applicable Laws.

5.9 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the transactions contemplated hereby, the board of directors of
the Company will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary
so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate the effects of any
Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

month after the Closing Date. 

5.11 _Company s Auditors_. The Company will use commercially reasonable
efforts (a) to cause its management and its independent auditors to

dividends, that would render or is reasonably likely to render Acquirer
insolvent, or unable to pay and discharge its obligations hereunder.



 

-31- 5.13 _Credit for Prior Service_. All prior service with the Company by each
employee thereof who is hired by Acquirer as contemplated by Section 7.1(e)
shall be credited for purposes of eligibility and participation under any
employee benefit plan at any time established, maintained or assumed by
Acquirer and for purposes of vesting under Acquirers 401(k) plan, all to the
extent applicable, unless such credit is prohibited by applicable Law. All
prior service with the Company by each such employee shall also count toward
the service requirements of sick pay, paid time off and vacation accrual
policies and practices at any time established, maintained or assumed by
Acquirer. To the extent not prohibited by an insurer or service provider under
Acquirers applicable medical or health plans and the Law, Acquirer
shall waive or cause to be waived any preexisting condition exclusion or
limitation in any medical or health plan made available by Acquirer to any
such employee to the extent such exclusion or limitation did not apply to a
preexisting condition with respect to such employee under a similar or
corresponding benefit plan of the Company. Nothing in the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement shall impose a duty on Acquirer to assume
the 401(k) plan or any other benefit plan of the Company and Acquirer hereby
specifically disclaims the assumption of such plans.

AGREEMENTS; INDEMNIFICATION HOLDBACK PROVISIONS

covenants and agreements of the other party contained in this Agreement or in
any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement. The representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall not be affected by any
investigation conducted for or on behalf of Acquirer with respect thereto or
any knowledge acquired by Acquirer or its officers, directors, employees or
agents as to the accuracy or inaccuracy of any such representation or
warranty. Except for Section 1.4(b)(i), the mechanisms set forth in Sections
6.2(d), (e) and (f) with respect to claims then outstanding (which mechanisms
shall survive until the payment in full of all indemnification claims), and
the Specified Representations (which shall survive through the applicable
statute of limitations applicable to claims related thereto), all of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties contained
in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement
shall survive, unless terminated earlier or later by their terms,
the Acquisition and continue for twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date (the " _Expiration Date_ "). Any claims based upon fraud or willful
misrepresentation shall survive until the applicable statute of limitations.

 

6.2 _Indemnification Provisions_.

(a) _Establishment of the Indemnification Holdback_. At the Closing, Eleven
Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($11,750,000) of the Base Payment
(the " _Holdback "Amount_ ") will be held back by Acquirer, such hold back to
constitute the " _Indemnification_  



 

-32-   _Holdback_ ," as partial security for the indemnification obligations of
the Company and the Shareholders under this Section 6.2. For purposes of this
Article 6, all references to the Company shall be deemed to include the
Shareholders.

(b) _Right to Indemnification_. 

(i) Subject to the limitations set forth herein, the parties and their
officers, directors, employees, agents, and Affiliates (collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") shall be indemnified and held harmless by the other party
(the " _Indemnitor_ ") hereto from and against any and all Losses incurred by
the Indemnitees directly or indirectly as a result of:

(A) any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty of the Indemnitor
contained herein including, but not limited to, the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 2.9 (Valid Title), excluding, however, the
last sentence thereof and 2.20 (Tax) (the " _Specified Representations_ ")
(provided, that, in the event of any such breach or inaccuracy, for purposes
of determining the amount of any Losses, no effect will be given to any
qualification as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" contained
therein);

(B) any failure by the Indemnitor to perform or comply with any covenant
contained herein;

(C) for a Company Indemnitee, any Assumed Liability;

(D) the Indemnitors failure to comply with any bulk sales or fraudulent
transfer laws that may be applicable to the Acquisition, any Taxes arising as
a result of the other partys operation of the Business or ownership of the
Purchased Assets prior to the Closing, and any Taxes that will arise as a
result of or in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition; or

(E) for an Acquirer Indemnitee, any Liability arising out of the Retained
Liabilities.

(F) Any amount owed to either respective party under Section 1.4(b)(x), which
is not timely paid; or

(ii) Subject to the further limitations set forth in Section 6.2(b)(iv), the
Indemnification Holdback shall _not_ be the sole remedy available to
compensate the Acquirer Indemnitees for any and all such Losses. The parties
agree that any Losses under this Article 6 shall be solely recoverable by an
Acquirer Indemnitee (A) first, by Acquirer withholding amounts from the
Indemnification Holdback and (B) second, by making claims against the Company
for amounts in excess of the Indemnification Holdback and (C) third, by
making claims pro rata against the Shareholders.

(iii) Except in the case of any claims under Section 6.2(b)(i)(E) or (F),
Acquirer may not make any claims against the Company Indemnitor unless the
aggregate Losses (each of which individually exceeds Two Thousand Dollars
($2,000)) incurred or sustained exceed Three Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand
Dollars ($375,000) (the " _Basket_ ") (at which such time claims may be made
for all Losses incurred or sustained).



 

-33- (iv) Except as set forth in Section 6.2(b)(v), (A) during the period from the
Closing Date until Ninety (90) days thereafter (" _Period 1_ "), the Company
Indemnitor shall not have Liability for indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this
Article 6 to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds
Seventeen Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($17,250,000); (B)
during the period from the end of Period 1 until One Hundred Eighty (180) days
after the Closing Date (" _Period 2_ "), the Company Indemnitor shall not
have Liability for indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this Article 6 claimed
during Period 2 to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds
Twelve Million Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($12,075,000); (C) during the
period from the end of Period 2 until one year after the Closing Date ("
_Period 3_ "), the Company Indemnitor shall not have Liability for
indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this Article 6 claimed during Period 3 to the
extent that the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds Six Million Nine
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($6,900,000); and (D) neither party shall have any
Liability for indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this Article 6 after one year
from the Closing Date; and, provided, further, the Company Indemnitor shall
not have Liability for indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this Article 6 to the
extent that the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds Seventeen Million Two
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($17,250,000) for claims for Losses during the
time spanned by Periods 1 through 3.

(v) Any limitations set forth in this Section 6.2(b) or otherwise shall not
apply to Losses as a result of fraud or willful misrepresentation or breaches
of any Specified Representations. With respect to actions grounded in fraud or
willful misrepresentation, (A) the right of a party to be indemnified and
held harmless pursuant to the indemnification provisions in this Agreement
shall be in addition to and cumulative of any other remedy of such party at
law or in equity and (B) no such party shall, by exercising any remedy
available to it under this Article 6, be deemed to have elected such remedy
exclusively or to have waived any other remedy, whether at law or in equity,
available to it.

(c) _Holdback Period; Distribution of Holdback Amount upon Termination of
Holdback Period_. Subject to the following requirements, the Indemnification
Holdback Fund shall be in existence immediately following the Closing and
shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on the expiration of Period 2
(the period of time from the Closing Date through and including the expiration
of Period 2 is referred to herein as the " _Holdback Period_ "); and all cash
then remaining in the Indemnification Holdback shall be distributed as set
forth in this Section 6.2(c). Subject to the following requirements, Acquirer
shall release eight million five hundred thousand dollars ($8,500,000) of the
Holdback Amount to the Company on the expiration of Period 1 and the balance
on the expiration of Period 2, in either event less (i) any amounts paid to
Acquirer during such period in accordance with this Article 6, and (ii) any
amount that is reasonably necessary, as reflected in documentation provided
by Acquirer to the Company in good faith, to satisfy any unsatisfied claims
(including costs of defense) concerning facts and circumstances existing prior
to the release date which claims are specified in any Officers Certificate
delivered to the Company in good faith prior to the Expiration Date.

(d) _Claims Upon Indemnification Holdback_. At any time on or before 5 p.m.,
California time, on the last day of the Holdback Period Acquirer may deliver
to the Company a certificate signed by any officer of Acquirer in good faith
(an " _Officer s Certificate_"): (A) stating that Acquirer or another
Acquirer Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued or reasonably anticipates
that it will have to pay or accrue Losses and the amount thereof, and  



 

-34-  (B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included
in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid or
properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature
of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty, agreement or covenant to which
such item is related and the relevant section number of this Agreement, and,
subject to the provisions of Section 6.2(d), deduct out of the Holdback
Amount, cash held in the Indemnification Holdback in an amount equal to such
Losses and if such amount exceeds the available Holdback Amount, pursue its
rights and remedies against the Company. Where the basis for a claim upon the
Indemnification Holdback by Acquirer is that Acquirer reasonably anticipates
that it will incur or pay a Loss (a " _Contingent Loss_ "), no payment will be
made from the Indemnification Holdback for such Contingent Loss unless and
until such Contingent Loss is actually incurred or paid and a further
Officers Certificate with respect thereto is delivered to the Company;
_provided, however,_ that the amount of such Contingent Loss shall not be
released from the Indemnification Holdback unless and until such Contingent
Loss is incurred or paid or it is conclusively determined that no actual Loss
will be incurred or paid with regard thereto.

(e) _Objections to Claims_.

(i) For a period of twenty (20) Business Days from and after delivery of any
Officers Certificate to the Company, Acquirer shall take no action regarding
the Indemnification Holdback unless Acquirer shall have received written
authorization from the Company to retain such portion of the Indemnification
Holdback. After the expiration of such twenty (20) Business Day period,
Acquirer shall retain the portion of the Indemnification Holdback in
accordance with Section 6.2(d) hereof and the Company shall no longer be
entitled to receive such amount hereunder, provided that no such retention may
be made if the Company shall object in a written statement to the claim made
in the Officers Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to
Acquirer prior to the expiration of such twenty (20) Business Day period.

(ii) In case the Company shall so object in writing to any claim or claims by
Acquirer made in any Officers Certificate, Acquirer shall have twenty (20)
Business Days to respond in a written statement to the objection of the
Company. If after such twenty (20) Business Day period there remains a
dispute as to any claims, the Company and Acquirer shall attempt in good faith
for thirty (30) Business Days to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Company and Acquirer
should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared
by Acquirer and signed by the Company and Acquirer. Acquirer shall be entitled
to rely on any such memorandum and shall retain or release the cash from the
Indemnification Holdback in accordance with the terms thereof.

(iii) _Resolution of Conflicts_. If no agreement can be reached after good
faith negotiation between the parties pursuant to Section 6.2(e)(ii), the
Company and Acquirer may initiate formal arbitration pursuant to Section 9.8
to resolve such dispute. The decision of the arbitrator(s) as to the validity
and amount of any claim in such Officers Certificate shall be binding and
conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in
Article 6 hereof, the parties shall be required to act in accordance with
such decision and Acquirer shall be required to make or withhold payments out
of the Indemnification Holdback in accordance therewith.



 

-35- (f) _Third-Party Claims_.

(i) In the event either party becomes aware of a third-party claim (a " _Third
Party Claim_ ") regarding pre-Closing operations of the Business, such party
shall notify the other party of such claim, and the Company shall have the
right (but not the obligation) to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
and to retain (at the Companys expense) counsel of its choice, reasonably
acceptable to Acquirer, to represent Acquirer, _provided_ , _however_ , that
this option shall not be available to the Company for Third Party Claims (i)
initiated by any of the then fifteen major customers and suppliers of the
Business, (ii) which may result in criminal proceedings, injunctions or other
equitable remedies in respect of Acquirer or its Affiliates, or (iii) also
involves Acquirer or its Affiliates as a party and counsel to the
Company determines in good faith that joint representation would give rise to
a conflict of interest, for which defense shall be assumed by Acquirer with
the right to retain (at the Companys expense) counsel of its choice,
reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Company shall have ten (10) days
from the receipt of the Notice of Claim to notify Acquirer whether or not it
desires to defend such Third Party Claim failing which the Company shall be
deemed to have waived such option. The party assuming defense of a Third
Party Claim is hereinafter referred to as the " _Controlling Party_ " and the
other party as the " _Co-Party_ ".

(ii) In defending the Third Party Claim, the Controlling Party shall act in
good faith and use commercially reasonable means and defenses available to it
given due consideration to the interests of Acquirer. The Co-Party shall take
such actions as reasonably necessary or appropriate under the circumstances to
cooperate with the Controlling Party and its counsel in defending such Third
Party Claim. The Controlling Party shall keep the Co-Party
reasonably informed of the development of the underlying claim. In the case
where the Acquirer is the Co-Party, the Co-Party shall have the right to
participate, at its sole cost and expense in the defense of a Third Party
Claim using its own counsel (unless (x) the Controlling Party shall not have
employed counsel in the defense of such Claim after ten (10) days notice; or
(y) such Co-Party shall have determined in good faith that joint
representation would give rise to a conflict of interest; in any of the
foregoing events such fees and expenses shall be borne by the Controlling
Party).

(iii) Neither the Co-Party nor the Controlling Party shall conclude any
settlements, compromises, agreements or withdrawals in response to any claims,
verifications, or legal or administrative proceedings in which it may be
involved without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, in particular with respect to the
settlement of disputes with customers, for which customary practice and the
commercial relationship shall be taken into account.

(g) _Treatment of Payments_. To the extent permitted by law, the parties agree
to treat payments made under this Article 6 as adjustments to the Final
Purchase Price.
