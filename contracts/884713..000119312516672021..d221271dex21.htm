Representative hereunder. The Purchaser Parties and Sellers agree that
the purpose of preparing the Closing Date Schedule and determining the
Closing Date Net Working Capital and the related purchase price adjustment
contemplated by this _Section 2.4_ is to measure changes in the Closing Date
Net Working Capital against the Target Net Working Capital in accordance with
GAAP applied on the same basis as that used by the Company in the preparation
of the Sample Working Capital and the principles set forth on _Exhibit B_ ,
and not to introduce any inconsistent accounting methods, policies,
principles or practices of the Purchaser Parties (or otherwise).

(b)  _Objections_. The Sellers Representative shall have the right to object
to any amount or computation appearing in the Closing Date Schedule by
notifying Purchaser in writing of such objections prior to the expiration of
the Review Period. If the Sellers Representative does not make any such
objection prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Date Net
Working Capital (together with all components thereof, and the amounts of such
components, necessary to compute the Closing Date Net Working Capital), the
Closing Date Cash Amount and the Final Base Purchase Price, in each case as
set forth on the Closing Date Schedule, shall be determinative for purposes of
this _Section 2.4_ and shall be final and binding on all of the parties to
this Agreement subject to _Section 2.4(g)_.

shall, during the thirty (30) day period following the delivery of the
Sellers Representatives objection to Purchaser, attempt in good faith
jointly to resolve the matters on the Closing Date Schedule to which the
Sellers Representative objected. In the event the Sellers Representative
and Purchaser cannot resolve all of such matters by the end of such thirty
(30) day period, either party may immediately engage the Neutral Accountant
within ten (10) days after the end of such period to resolve the items that
remain in dispute. Each of Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall
present its position on such remaining disputed items to the Neutral
Accountant in writing. The Neutral Accountant, acting as an expert and not an
arbitrator, shall be instructed to resolve only the matters objected to by the
Sellers

 



16  Representative and not resolved by the Sellers Representative and Purchaser
with respect to the submission to it of such items, within thirty (30) days of
such submission, subject to one automatic fifteen (15)-day extension should
the Neutral Accountant have substantive questions for the parties. In
resolving any disputed item, the Neutral Accountant (i) shall be bound by the
provisions of this _Section 2.4(c)_ , (ii) may not resolve any disputed
matter of Law or fact, except to correct plain error or to reflect a
determination by the Neutral Accountant that an accounting policy or procedure
used in the preparation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the
Closing Date Cash Amount, or the Final Base Purchase Price based thereon, as
applicable, was not in accordance with GAAP, (iii) may not assign a value to
any item greater than the highest value claimed for such item or less than the
lowest value for such item claimed by either Purchaser or the Sellers
Representative, (iv) shall restrict its decision solely to such items as are
listed in the notice of dispute which are then in dispute, (v) may review only
the written presentations, answers and replies of the Sellers Representative
and Purchaser in resolving any matter which is in dispute, (vi) shall render
its decision in writing setting forth in reasonable detail the basis upon
which its decision was made, and (vii) shall base that decision solely on
this Agreement, _Exhibit B_ and GAAP. All fees and expenses of the Neutral
Accountant in connection with any dispute under this _Section 2.4(c)_ shall be
borne by the Sellers and Purchaser proportionately based upon the portion of
the aggregate dollar amount of disputed items not awarded to a party relative
to the aggregate dollar amount of disputed items submitted to the Neutral
Accountant, which proportion shall be determined by the Neutral Accountant.

 

(d) _Final Closing Date Schedule_. The Closing Date Net Working Capital and
Closing Date Cash Amount finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ or
_(c_ ), as applicable, and the Final Base Purchase Price based thereon, shall
be determinative for purposes of this _Section 2.4_ and shall be final and
binding on all of the parties to this Agreement, subject to Section 2.4(g).
All components, and the amounts of such components, necessary to compute the
final and binding Closing Date Net Working Capital, the amount of the Closing
Date Cash Amount and the Final Base Purchase Price based thereon are referred

Purchaser, and (B) pay the amount, if any, by which the Working Capital Escrow
Amount is greater than such shortfall to the Sellers Representative for the
benefit of the Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a
bank account designated by the Sellers Representative, in each case no later
than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the completion of the Final
Closing Date Schedule.

list of all leases and subleases (including any and all amendments,
modifications, supplements, addenda, and restatements thereto and thereof and
subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreements related thereto) to
which any Acquired Company is a party as lessee or sublessee of any real
property (the " _Real Property Leases_ "). Each of the Real Property Leases is
(i) a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Acquired Company party
thereto, and (ii) enforceable against such Acquired Company and, to the
Companys Knowledge, the other party or parties thereto in accordance with its
terms, in each case except (A) as limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and
other similar Applicable Laws of general application affecting enforcement of
creditors rights generally and (B) the availability of the remedy of specific

Real Property Lease in any material respect. No Acquired Company has received
any written notice of default, termination or cancellation of any Real
Property Lease. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.11(b)_ , no Acquired
Company is a lessor, sublessor or grantor under any lease, sublease or other
instrument granting to any other Person any right to the possession, lease,
occupancy or enjoyment of any Real Property.

property subject to the Real Property Leases (collectively, the " _Real
Property_ ") is supplied with utilities suitable for the operation of the
business presently conducted thereon. There does not exist any pending or, to
the Companys Knowledge, threatened condemnation or eminent domain proceeding
with respect to any of the Real Property. There are no Actions commenced or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Real
Property or any portion thereof or interest therein in the nature or in lieu
of condemnation or eminent domain proceedings. No Acquired Company has
received written notice of any violation of any zoning, building, or similar
Applicable Law relating to its ownership or operation of the Real Property.

third party to purchase any parcel of Real Property, or any portion thereof,
and there are no Persons (other than the Acquired Companies) in possession of
the Real Property.

(e) _Use of Real Property_. The use and operation of the Real Property in the
conduct of each Acquired Companys business do not violate in any material
respect any Applicable Law or Permitted Encumbrance. No material improvements
constituting a part of the Owned Real Property encroach on real property
owned or leased by a Person other than an Acquired Company. Except as set
forth on _Schedule 4.11(e)_ , and except for the Owned Real Property, an
Acquired Company is the sole tenant of each parcel of leased Real Property and
the leased Real Property is not used for any purpose other than the storage
of finished goods inventory held for delivery to customers.

or order from any Governmental Entity to complete any material alteration,
repair, improvement or other work in respect of the Real Property which has
not been completed.

material repairs or replacements that are necessary as of the date hereof
with respect to the buildings or other structures, facilities, improvements,
fixtures and building systems forming part of the Real Property and (ii) the
Real Property is in a good state of repair and operating order having regard
to its age and the use to which it is put.

(h) _Contracts_. Except as set forth on  _Schedule 4.11(h)_ and this
Agreement, there are no Contracts to which any Acquired Company is a party to

threatened, Action with respect to any Benefit Plan (other than routine

inquiry that it is subject to an obligation of exclusivity but shall not
otherwise respond.

 

(c) The Company and the Sellers agree that the rights and remedies for
noncompliance with this _Section 6.4_ shall include having such provision
specifically enforced by any court having jurisdiction, it being acknowledged
and agreed that any such breach would cause irreparable injury to Purchaser
and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Purchaser. 

Section 6.5 _Publicity_.

 

The initial press releases, if any, with respect to the execution of this
Agreement shall be mutually acceptable to Purchaser, the Company and the
Sellers Representative and substantially in the form of _Exhibit G_.
Otherwise, prior to Closing, neither the Sellers, the Company nor Purchaser
shall (and shall not permit any of their respective Affiliates to) issue or
cause the release or publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without prior
approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) of the other parties hereto; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall
prevent any Person from making any public announcement (whether in a press
release, periodic securities filing or other external announcement) that such
Person reasonably believes to be required by Applicable Law or the
requirements of any stock exchange or quotation system. Notwithstanding the
foregoing restriction, Purchaser may make earnings announcements and
participate in investor conferences in the ordinary course of business
in which this Agreement and the Transactions are discussed.

 



53 Section 6.6 _Employees; Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) _WARN Act Compliance_. The Purchaser Parties shall cause the Acquired
Companies to employ and retain for such period of time following the Closing
Date such number of employees of the Acquired Companies as shall be necessary
to avoid any liability of Sellers for a violation of the WARN Act, attendant
to the Acquired Companies (or their Affiliates) failure to notify employees
of a "mass layoff" or "plant closing" (as such terms are defined in the WARN
Act). The Purchaser Parties shall be liable and responsible for any
notification required under the WARN Act (or under any similar state or local
Applicable Laws), and the Purchaser Parties shall indemnify and hold the
Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any Losses incurred by
any Seller Indemnified Party as a result of any Purchaser Partys or the
Acquired Companies failure to comply with the provisions of the WARN Act on
or after the Closing Date or any Purchaser Partys failure to comply with the
provisions of this _Section 6.6(a)_.

 

(b) _Comparable Benefits_. Effective for a period of one (1) year from and
after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to,
provide to the employees of the Company who are employed by the Purchaser
Parties or the Acquired Companies following the Closing Date (the " _Affected
Employees_ ") benefits, including group medical coverage, that are
substantially equivalent, in the aggregate, to the benefits available under
current Benefit Plans.

(c)  _Service Credit_. Effective from and after the Closing Date, Affected
Employees shall be given credit for purposes of vesting and eligibility to
participate in any employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements
maintained from time to time by the Purchaser Parties or the Acquired
Companies for such Affected Employees service with the Acquired Companies,
but only to the same extent and for the same purposes that such service was
taken into account under a corresponding Benefit Plan of the Acquired
Companies as of the Closing Date (other than benefit accrual, under defined
benefit pension plans, if any); _provided_ , _however_ , that no such service
shall be credited to the extent that it would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, for purposes of each such Purchaser Party employee
benefit plan or program that is an employee welfare benefit plan, as defined
in Section 3(1) of ERISA, the Purchaser Parties shall (i) waive all
limitations as to pre-existing conditions, evidence of insurability,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements to the extent such limitations were or would have been waived
under the Benefit Plans in which the Affected Employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) provide each Affected Employee
with credit for co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid prior
to the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying any applicable co-payment,
deductible and out-of-pocket expense requirements under any welfare plan of
the Purchaser Parties.

 



54 (d) _Certain Continuing Benefits_. Effective from and after the Closing Date,
the Purchaser Parties and the Acquired Companies shall be solely responsible
for providing continuing benefits or coverage for any participant or any
beneficiary of a participant who is or becomes a qualified beneficiary prior
to, on or after the Closing Date under any Benefit Plan that as of the
Closing Date is subject to the requirements of Code Section 4980B or Section
601 (et seq.) of ERISA, or mandated by other Applicable Law, whether such
obligation to provide continuing benefits or coverage under any such Benefit
Plan arises prior to, on or after the Closing Date.

(e) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. All provisions contained in this _Section
6.6_ with respect to employee benefit plans or employee compensation are
included for the sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall not
create any right in any other Person, including any employee or former
employee of the Acquired Companies or any participant or beneficiary in any
Benefit Plan.

 

(f) _Performance Bonuses_. The Purchaser Parties shall cause the Company to
pay the performance bonuses reflected in Current Liabilities on the Final
Closing Date Schedule to the applicable employees no later than the 15th day
of the third calendar month following the day prior to the Closing Date, but
only to the extent that such bonuses are fixed as of the day prior to the
Closing Date and the recipients are employed by the Company as of the payment
date.

 

Section 6.7 _Termination of Certain Arrangements_.

 

Sellers shall cause the agreements set forth on _Schedule 6.7_ by and between
the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and any Seller or its Affiliate
(other than an Acquired Company), on the other, to be terminated prior to or
upon the consummation of the Closing.

Prior to or at the Closing, the Sellers and the Company shall take all such
actions as are necessary to cause each of the following to have occurred or to
occur immediately prior to the Closing: the termination of the Phantom Equity
Plan; the termination of the Deferred Compensation Plan and the distribution
of all amounts payable thereunder to the Persons entitled thereto; the
distribution by the Company of the insurance policies identified on _Schedule
6.7_ ; the termination by the Company of the SERP Plan; the settlement in
full of all amounts due to the Company from its officers, directors, or
shareholders or, in the case of notes receivable from such Persons held by the
Company, the distribution or cancellation of those notes; and
the distribution to the Persons entitled thereto of all Excluded Assets.

Section 6.8 _Maintenance of Books and Records_. 

Each party hereto shall preserve (and the Purchaser Parties shall cause the
Acquired Companies to preserve), for a period of three (3) years following
the Closing Date, all pre-Closing Date records possessed by or under the
control of such party relating to the Acquired Companies. During the three
(3)-year period following the Closing Date, upon any reasonable request from
the other party hereto or its representatives, the party (or Acquired Company,
as

 



55  applicable) holding such records shall (a) provide to the requesting party
or its representatives reasonable access to such records during normal
business hours and (b) permit the requesting party or its representatives to
make copies of such records, in each case at the cost of the requesting party;
_provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 6.8_ shall require any party to
disclose information if such disclosure would, as determined in such partys
reasonable discretion, (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal
privilege, (ii) contravene any Applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (including any
confidentiality agreement to which such party or any of its Affiliates is a
party) or (iii) contravene any obligation of secrecy or confidentiality to any
Governmental Entity. Records may be sought under this _Section 6.8_ for
any reasonable purpose, including to the extent reasonably required in
connection with the audit, accounting, Tax, litigation, federal securities
disclosure or other similar proper business purpose of the party seeking such
records.

 

Section 6.9 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification_. 

(a) _Indemnification of Certain Persons_. For a period of six (6) years
following the Closing Date and excluding claims or actions of Purchaser
Indemnified Parties arising in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation by or in
the right of any Acquired Company, in which any of the present or former
officers or directors of any Acquired Company (collectively, the "
_Company Indemnified Persons_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made a party by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was, prior to the Closing Date, a
director, officer, employee or agent of any Acquired Company or of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise at the
request of any Acquired Company, whether such claim arises before or after the
Closing Date, the Purchaser Parties shall cause the applicable Acquired
Company to indemnify and hold harmless, at least to the same extent and on
terms and conditions no less favorable than those provided for in the
Organizational Document or Operating Document of the applicable Acquired
Company in effect immediately prior to the Closing or pursuant to any
other respective governing documents or indemnification agreements in effect
on the date hereof, each such Company Indemnified Person against any Losses in
connection with any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. The
Purchaser Parties shall cause the Acquired Companies to keep in effect, in
their respective Organizational Documents and Operating Documents, a provision
that provides for indemnification of the Company Indemnified Persons to the
extent required under this  _Section 6.9(a)_.

(b) _Insurance Coverage_. For a period of six (6) years after the Closing
Date, the Purchaser Parties shall cause the Acquired Companies to maintain
director and officer liability insurance providing coverage for the
individuals who were officers or directors of the Acquired Companies at and
prior to the Closing for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or prior to the Closing (excluding claims or actions in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions) comparable to and, as to scope of coverage and
amount, not less favorable in any material respect than, the policy or
policies maintained

 



56  by the Acquired Companies immediately prior to the Closing for the benefit
of such individuals. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser Parties
shall deliver to the Sellers Representative evidence of the continuation of
such coverage. Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand,
shall each bear one-half of the premium, taxes, broker fees and other costs
and expenses related to obtaining such coverage.

(c) _Non-Exclusive Indemnification; Attorneys  Fees_. This _Section 6.9_ is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Company Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and successors, each of
whom is an intended third-party beneficiary of this _Section 6.9_. The
indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which any Company Indemnified Person is entitled, whether
pursuant to Applicable Law, Contract or otherwise. The Purchaser Parties shall
cause the Acquired Companies to pay all expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Company Indemnified Person that
is the prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce its rights
under this _Section 6.9_.

 

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. In the event that following the Closing, any
Purchaser Party, any Acquired Company or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and will not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary to effectuate the purposes of this _Section 6.9_, the
Purchaser Parties shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, make
proper provision so that the successors and assigns of the Purchaser Parties
or the applicable Acquired Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

 

Section 6.10 _Purchaser Parties_ __ _Investigation_.

 

Each Purchaser Party is an informed and sophisticated Person and has engaged
expert advisors in connection with the Transactions experienced in the
evaluation and purchase of companies such as the Acquired Companies as
contemplated hereunder. The Purchaser Parties have conducted their own
independent investigation, review and analysis of the business, operations,
assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and prospects
of the Acquired Companies and their respective businesses and assets, and each
Purchaser Party acknowledges that it has been provided access to the
personnel, properties, premises and records of the Acquired Companies
relating to such business and assets to which it has requested such access. In
entering into this Agreement, each Purchaser Party acknowledges that it has
relied solely upon the aforementioned investigation, review and analysis and
not on any factual representations, opinions or statements of any of the
Sellers, the Acquired Companies or any of their agents or representatives
(except the specific representations and warranties of set forth in _Article
III_ and _Article IV_ ). Each Purchaser Party acknowledges that, except as set
forth in the representations and warranties contained _Article III_ and
_Article IV_ or in any certificate delivered with respect thereto, none of
the Sellers, the Acquired Companies or any other Person has made or makes any
representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or

 



57  completeness of any of the information provided or made available to either
Purchaser Party or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
representatives or any other Person for their benefit. Each Purchaser Party
agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws, that (excepting in
the case of intentional fraud, and except for the representations and
warranties set forth in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ ) no Seller and none
of any Sellers Affiliates, agents, advisors or representatives shall have any
liability or responsibility whatsoever to any Purchaser Party or its
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies
after the Closing), controlling persons, agents or representatives on any
basis (including in contract or tort, under federal, state or foreign
securities laws or otherwise) based upon any information (including any
estimates, projections, forecasts, operating plans or budgets concerning
revenues, costs, expenditures, cash flows, results of operations, financial
condition, prospects or other information relating to the Acquired Companies)
provided or made available, or statements made, to any Purchaser Party or its
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling persons, advisors,
agents or representatives (including in materials furnished in the Acquired
Companies data room, in presentations by any of the Acquired Companies
management, in the confidential information memorandum made available to the
Purchaser Parties, or otherwise), or any omissions therefrom. For clarity,
this _Section 6.10_ shall not be considered to operate as a waiver or
limitation of any specific rights set forth in _Section 9.2_.

Section 6.11 _Restrictive Covenants_.

(a) _Non-Compete_. During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending
on the third anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "),
each Seller covenants and agrees not to, and shall cause its Affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly, conduct, manage, operate, engage in, be employed
by, render services to, be affiliated with, control or participate in the
management, operation or control of, or have an ownership interest in, any
business or enterprise in competition with the Business as conducted or
operated by any Acquired Company prior to the date hereof anywhere in the
world. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the covenants in this
_Section 6.11(a)_ shall not prohibit ownership by any Seller of less than two
percent (2%) of the outstanding securities of any company traded on any
national securities exchange (so long as such Seller does not otherwise
control such company) or the performance of any services for the Purchaser or
its Affiliates.

 

(b) _Non-Solicitation_.

 

(i) During the Restricted Period, each Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, call on, solicit or induce, or
attempt to solicit or induce, any past, present or prospective customer,
vendor, or other business relation of any Acquired Company for the provision
of products or services related to the Business or in any other manner that
would interfere with the business relationship between any Acquired Company,
on the one hand, and its customers, vendors and other business relations, on
the other hand.

 

(ii) During the Restricted Period, each Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, call on, solicit, or induce, or
attempt to

 



58  solicit or induce, any Person who is an employee or independent contractor
of any Acquired Company (or who had been an employee or independent contractor
of any Acquired Company within twelve months prior thereto) to leave the
employ or service of any Acquired Company for any reason whatsoever, nor shall
any Seller or its Affiliates offer or provide employment (whether such
employment is for any Seller or any other business or enterprise), either on
a full-time basis or part-time or consulting basis, to any such employee or
independent contractor within three months of their departure from an Acquired
Company; provided that the foregoing shall not preclude any Seller
from making good faith general solicitations for employees through
advertisements in publications of general circulation, over the internet or
through employment recruiters, agencies or search firms and soliciting and
hiring any person who responds thereto.

(c) _Non-Disclosure_. From and after the Closing Date, no Seller shall
disclose or use, directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information (as
defined below), except as expressly permitted pursuant this Agreement. If the
disclosure of Confidential Information is required by Law, each Seller agrees
to use such Sellers commercially reasonable efforts, at Purchasers sole
cost and expense, to provide Purchaser an opportunity to object to the
disclosure and give Purchaser as much prior written notice as is possible
under the circumstances. For purposes of this  _Section 6.11(c)_, "
_Confidential Information_ " means all information belonging to, used by, or
which is in the possession of any Seller relating to any Acquired Companys
business or assets to the extent (i) such information has not been
disseminated to the public or is otherwise not generally known to competitors
of any Acquired Company, (ii) such information has not become known to such
Seller as a result of disclosure by a third party not known by such Seller to
have an obligation of confidentiality to Purchaser or any Acquired Company, or
(iii) such information is not required to be disclosed by applicable Law, in
each case specifically including information relating to any
Acquired Companys products, services, strategies, pricing, customers,
representatives, suppliers, distributors, technology, finances, employee
compensation, computer software and hardware, inventions, developments, or
Trade Secrets.

 

(d) _Acknowledgement_. Each Seller acknowledges that the provisions of this
_Section 6.11_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate
business interests of Parent and Purchaser and its acquisition of the Shares
and the Membership Interests. In addition to any other remedies that Purchaser
or Parent may have for any breach or threat of breach by any Seller or its
Affiliates of the provisions of this _Section 6.11_, Purchaser shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent such breaches or
threatened breaches and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof, and Purchaser shall not be required to post any bond. The restrictive
covenants contained in this _Section 6.11_ are covenants independent of any
other provision of this Agreement or any other agreement between the parties
hereunder and the existence of any claim which any Seller may allege against
Purchaser under any other provision of this Agreement or any other agreement
will not prevent the enforcement of these covenants. If any of the
provisions contained in this _Section 6.11_ shall for any reason be held to
be excessively broad as to duration, scope, activity or subject, then such
provision shall be construed by limiting and reducing it, so as to be valid
and enforceable to the extent compatible with the applicable

 



59  law or the determination by a court of competent jurisdiction. Should any
Seller breach any of its covenants contained in _Section 6.11(a)_, the term
of the covenant that is breached shall be extended for such Seller by the
duration of the breach.

Section 6.12 _Schedule Updates_.

 

From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the Company and
the Sellers shall update, amend or modify the Schedules relating to the
representations and warranties in _Article IV_ to reflect any facts,
circumstances or events occurring, first arising or becoming known during the
period subsequent to the date hereof, by providing Purchaser with prompt
written notice setting forth the proposed update, amendment or modification
and specifying the Schedule or Schedules affected thereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such Schedules are updated, amended or modified in a
manner that discloses any matter or circumstance that, but for such update,
amendment or modification, would cause (a) the representations and warranties
in _Sections 4.1_ (Organization; Qualification), _4.2_ (Authorization), _4.5_
(Capitalization; Ownership), and _4.6_ (Subsidiaries) not to be true and
correct or (b) the representations and warranties in _Article IV_ other than
those set forth in clause (a) not to be true and correct (without giving
effect to any limitations as to "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse
Effect") and such underlying fact, event or circumstance could reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, then, in either case
(a) or (b) Purchaser may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
10.1(e)_. Unless Purchaser has the right to terminate this Agreement as
provided in this _Section 6.12_ and timely exercises such right pursuant to
_Section 10.1(e)_, such update, amendment or modification shall not be
deemed to result in a failure of the condition set forth in _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_ or _(c)(iii)_ , as applicable, to be satisfied. No update,
amendment, or modification made pursuant to this _Section 6.12_ shall be
deemed to have cured any breach or inaccuracy and the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall not be deemed to have waived any right to indemnification
hereunder with respect thereto.

 

Section 6.13 _R andW Policy_

 

The Purchaser Parties will not amend, waive or otherwise modify any provision
of the RandW Policy in any manner that would allow the insurer thereunder or
any other Person to subrogate or otherwise make or bring any action or
proceedings against any Seller or any Affiliate thereof or any past, present
or future director, manager, officer, employee or advisor of any of the
foregoing based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, except in the case of
intentional fraud.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any transfer, documentary,

at their expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
required with respect to all such Taxes. The Sellers shall cooperate with
respect thereto as necessary.

 

Section 8.2 _Tax Returns_.

 

The Sellers Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely
file, or cause to be timely filed, all income Tax Returns for the Acquired
Companies required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to any Tax

All such income Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past

of any election or any accounting method. At least thirty (30) days prior to
the date (including extensions) on which any such income Tax Return to be

requested by Purchaser, supporting documentation) to Purchaser for its review

Purchaser shall, within ten (10) days after delivery of such income Tax Return
notify the Sellers Representative in writing of such objection, specifying
with particularity any such item and stating the specific factual or legal
basis for any objection. The Sellers Representative shall consider in good
faith all reasonable changes requested by Purchaser. Purchaser shall
prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely file, or cause to be timely
filed, all other Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies required to be filed
after the Closing Date with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Periods or Straddle
Periods. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
past practice (except as otherwise required by Applicable Law) and without a
change of any election or any accounting method. At least thirty (30) days
prior to the date (including extensions) on which any such Tax Return to be
prepared by Purchaser is due, Purchaser shall submit such Tax Return (together
with, to the extent reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative,
supporting documentation) to the Sellers Representative for its review and
comment. If the Sellers Representative objects to any item of any such Tax
Return, the Sellers Representative shall, within ten (10) days after delivery
of such Tax Return notify Purchaser in writing of such objection, specifying
with particularity any such item and stating the specific factual or legal
basis for any objection. Purchaser shall consider in good faith all reasonable
changes requested by the Sellers Representative. With respect to any periods
beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date ("
_Straddle Periods_ "), the portion of the Straddle Period that ends as of the
Effective Time shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, be treated as
a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and the allocation of Taxes shall be determined on
an interim closing of the books as of the Effective Time, except for ad
valorem Taxes and other Taxes due without regard 

 



64  to income, employment or receipts which shall be prorated on a daily basis.
To the extent permitted by Applicable Law (and only to such extent), any
deductions attributable to any of the Company Transaction Expenses, repayment
of Closing Date Debt, any employee bonuses, severance payments, debt
prepayment fees, capitalized debt costs, or any liabilities taken into account
in the determination of Closing Date Net Working Capital shall be allocated
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the day prior to the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall not take any action, or allow the Acquired Companies to take
any action, on the Closing Date that could increase the
indemnification obligations of Sellers with respect to Taxes.

Section 8.3 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 

After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Purchaser (or the Acquired
Companies) and Sellers shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other,
as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance (to the extent
within the control of such party) relating to the Acquired Companies
(including access to books, records and personnel) as is reasonably requested
for the filing of all Tax Returns (including any extensions thereof), the
making of any election related to Taxes, the preparation for any Audit, and
the prosecution or defense of any action related to any Tax Return. Purchaser
(on behalf of itself and the Acquired Companies) and Sellers agree to retain
all books and records with respect to Tax matters and pertinent to the
Acquired Companies relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by any Acquired Company or Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Governmental Entity.

 

Section 8.4 _Tax Contests_.

 

Purchaser shall notify the Sellers Representative within ten (10) days of
either its receipt (a) of any notice of any Audit in respect of Taxes (" _Tax
Contest_ ") or (b) of a written notice threatening any Tax Contest, in either
case relating in whole or in part to Taxes for which any of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties may be entitled to indemnification from the Sellers
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , failure to timely provide such notice
shall not affect the Purchaser Indemnified Parties right to indemnification
except to the extent such failure prejudices Sellers ability to defend the
claim or dispute that is the subject of such notice or results in the
expiration of the relevant time period set forth in _Section 9.5_. If the
Sellers Representative notifies Purchaser within thirty (30) days following
receipt of notice of such Tax Contest that the Sellers Representative
intends to exercise its contest rights under this _Section 8.4_, the Sellers
Representative shall have the right to control such Tax Contest at its expense
and to employ counsel of its choice; provided, however, that the Sellers
Representative acknowledges in writing the Sellers responsibility to
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to
all Taxes at issue in such Tax Contest other than amounts, if any,
recoverable under the RandW Policy. Purchaser shall have the right to
participate in any such Tax Contest jointly with the Sellers Representative.
With respect to a Tax Contest which the Sellers Representative is entitled
to control, the Sellers Representative shall not settle, compromise or
otherwise resolve any Tax Contest without the prior written consent of
Purchaser (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Purchaser shall

 



65  cause the Acquired Companies to deliver to the Sellers Representative any
power of attorney reasonably required to allow the Sellers Representative and
its counsel to represent the Acquired Companies in connection with any Tax
Contest that the Sellers Representative is entitled to control hereunder and
shall provide the Sellers Representative with such assistance as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such Tax Contest. Purchaser shall
control any other Tax Contests with respect to the Acquired Companies,
provided that Sellers Representative shall have the right to participate in
any such Tax Contest jointly with Purchaser, and Purchaser shall not agree to
settle any Tax liability or compromise any claim with respect to Taxes
involving the Acquired Companies, which settlement or compromise affects the
liability for Taxes hereunder that is indemnifiable by the Sellers under this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative
(which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
parties each agree to consult with and to keep the other parties hereto
informed on a regular basis regarding the status of any Tax Contest to the
extent that such Tax Contest could affect a liability of such other parties
(including indemnity obligations hereunder).

 

Section 8.5 _Amended Tax Returns_.

 

Purchaser shall not (and Purchaser shall not permit any Acquired Company to)
amend a Tax Return of any of the Acquired Companies with respect to a taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date, or file or amend any Tax election
with respect to any of the Acquired Companies with respect to a taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date, in each case without the prior written
consent of the Sellers Representative (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 8.6  _Refunds_.

To the extent any determination of the Tax liability of any of the Acquired
Companies, whether as a result of an Audit, a claim for refund, the filing of
an original or amended Tax Return, or otherwise, results in any refund or
credit of Taxes paid by the Acquired Companies on or prior to the Closing Date
to the extent not taken into account in the calculation of Closing Date Net
Working Capital or by or on behalf of the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than any carryback refund
attributable to losses or credits that accrue in a taxable period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date), Purchaser shall cause the
applicable Acquired Company to pay any such refund or credit, and any interest
received thereon, net of any Taxes of Purchaser or the Acquired Companies
attributable to such refund or credit and any other reasonable costs of
obtaining such refund or credit, to the Sellers within ten (10) days of
receipt or realization thereof by such Acquired Company.

 

Section 8.7 _Conflict_.

 

To the extent any provisions of this _Article VIII_ regarding the process for
dispute resolution with respect to Taxes conflict with the provisions
regarding the process for dispute resolution generally in _Article IX_, the
provisions of this _Article VIII_ shall control with respect to claims
hereunder for Losses that are Tax-related and other disputes regarding Taxes
hereunder.

68 Section 9.4 _Method of Asserting Claims_.

 

All claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party under this _Article
IX_ shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any claim or demand in respect of which an
Indemnified Party might seek indemnity under this _Article IX_ is asserted
against such Indemnified Party by a Person other than a party hereto (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice (the "
_Third Party Claim Notice_ ") and the details thereof including an estimate
of the claimed Losses and copies of all relevant pleadings, documents and
information to the Indemnifying Party within a period of twenty (20) days
following the assertion of the Third Party Claim against the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the
extent such failure shall have prejudiced the Indemnifying Party or shall
have resulted in the expiration of the relevant time period set forth in
_Section 9.5_. Within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Third Party
Claim Notice (the " _Third Party Claim Response Period_ "), the Indemnifying
Party shall give notice to the Indemnified Party, in writing, of whether the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
under this _Article IX_ ; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not have
the right to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim if (i) such Third
Party Claim seeks, as its primary recourse (which may be in addition to or in
lieu of monetary damages), an injunction or other equitable relief; (ii) such
Third Party Claim exceeds the cap applicable to such indemnity item, after
taking into account all previous payments made to Purchaser or a Seller, as
applicable, pursuant to this _Article IX_ , by an amount that results in the
Indemnifying Partys maximum potential indemnification obligation hereunder
with respect to such Third Party Claim being less than fifty percent (50%) of
the amount of such Third Party Claim; (iii) such Third Party Claim relates to
or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation; or (iv) a conflict on any significant issue
exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in respect of
the Third Party Claim such that joint representation is precluded under
applicable standards of professional conduct.

If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it elects to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, then such defense will be
conducted by the Indemnifying Party by all appropriate proceedings and shall
be diligently prosecuted to a final conclusion or will be settled, at the
discretion of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , that unless consented to
in advance by the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement that
requires a non-monetary commitment by the Indemnified Party or includes a
payment by the Indemnified Party that will not be indemnified by the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party will cooperate fully in such
defense, including making available to the 

 



69  Indemnifying Party all books, records and documents within the Indemnified
Partys control or that it can reasonably obtain relating to the Third Party
Claim. The Indemnified Party, at its expense, may participate in, but not
control, the defense of any Third Party Claim assumed by the Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this _Section 9.4(a)_.

 

If the Indemnifying Party, within the Third Party Claim Response Period (or
sooner if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires), elects not to
defend such Third Party Claim or fails to defend such Third Party Claim
actively and in good faith, then the Indemnified Party shall (after giving
written notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party) have the right
to undertake the defense (at the Indemnifying Partys expense), compromise or
settle such Third Party Claim, or consent to the entry of a judgment with
respect thereto; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall have no
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any such compromise or
settlement thereof or consent to the entry of a judgment with respect thereto
without the Indemnifying Partys consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld).

 

(b) _Other Claims_. In the event any Indemnified Party has a claim under this
_Article IX_ against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give written notice (the " _Claim
Notice_ ") and the details thereof, including an estimate of the claimed
Losses and copies of all relevant information and documents, to the
Indemnifying Party within a period of thirty (30) days following the discovery
or receipt of notification of the claim by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,
that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent such
failure shall have materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party or shall have
resulted in the expiration of the time period set forth in _Section 9.5_. The
Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party within a period of thirty
(30) days after the receipt of the Claim Notice by the Indemnifying Party (the
" _Claim Response Period_ ") whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability to the Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_ with respect to
such claim.

If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Claim
Response Period that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with
respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not
resolved through negotiations within a period of thirty (30) days from the
date of such notice, either party may resort to litigation in accordance with
_Section 9.4(c)_.

 

(c) _Resolution of Disputes_. Any dispute submitted to litigation pursuant to
this _Section 9.4(c)_ shall be finally and conclusively determined by
litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction. Each party to this Agreement
agrees that the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware
shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any suit, action or
proceeding, and to settle any disputes, which may arise out of or in
connection with this Agreement and, for such purposes, consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. Each of the
parties hereto (i) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and (ii) agrees that it shall not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the Transactions in any court other than courts set forth
above.

(d) _Sellers  Representative_. For procedural purposes, the Sellers
Representatives shall serve as the Indemnifying Parties representative with
respect to any claim against the Sellers made by any Purchaser Indemnified
Party under _Section 9.2_ that relates to a breach or failure by the Company;
_provided_ , that any and all Losses payable to any Purchaser Indemnified
Party with respect thereto shall limited to and satisfied exclusively as
provided in _Section 9.6(b)_. Without limiting its obligations hereunder as a
Seller, the Sellers Representative, in such capacity, shall have no
indemnification obligation to any Purchaser Indemnified Party hereunder,
notwithstanding the Sellers Representatives participation in the giving
and receipt of notices and other actions on behalf of the Sellers under this
Agreement. The Purchaser Parties shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon
any action or the giving and receipt of notice by the Sellers Representative.

 



70 Section 9.5 _Time Limits on Claims_.

 

Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 9.5_ , the representations and
warranties of each of the parties hereto set forth in this Agreement or in
any certificate delivered by any party hereto at the Closing shall survive the
Closing until the Expiration Date, at which time they shall expire and be of
no further force and effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a)
the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3.1_
(Organization), _3.2_ (Authorization), _3.5_ (Ownership of the Shares), and
_3.7_ (Brokers); _Sections 4.1_ (Organization; Qualification), _4.2_
 (Authorization), _4.5(a)_ (Capitalization; Ownership), _4.6_
(Subsidiaries), and _4.25_ (Brokers); and _Sections 5.1_ (Organization), _5.2_
(Authorization), and _5.6_ (Availability of Funds; Solvency) (collectively,
the " _Fundamental Representations_ ") shall survive indefinitely and (b) the
representations and warranties in _Section 4.19_ (Tax Matters) (the " _Tax
Representations_ ") shall survive until the 60th day after the expiration of
the statute of limitations (including any extensions or tolling thereof)
applicable thereto, at which time such representations and warranties shall
expire and be of no further force and effect. All covenants and agreements of
the parties contained herein shall survive the Closing indefinitely or for the
period explicitly specified therein; provided that covenants to be fully
performed at or prior to the Closing shall expire upon the occurrence of the
Closing. Notwithstanding the preceding portion of this _Section 9.5_ , any
claim relating to the breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement set forth herein that is asserted in writing pursuant to _Section
9.4_ prior to the applicable survival end date described above shall survive
until such claim is finally resolved and satisfied in accordance with this
_Article IX_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the applicable
survival end date set forth in this _Section 9.5_ shall be tolled during the
time in which Purchaser is using its commercially reasonable efforts to
recover under the RandW Policy pursuant to _Section 9.6(b)(ii)(B)_.

 



71 Section 9.6 _Additional Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

 

(a) _Individual Claim Threshold; Deductible; Cap_

 

(i) No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall make an indemnity claim under
_Section 9.2_ with respect to any individual occurrence unless and until the
aggregate amount of Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
arising from such occurrence exceeds or may reasonably be expected to exceed
$15,000.

 

(ii) No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification under
_Sections 9.2(a)(i),_ _9.2(b)(i),_ or  _9.2(b)(v)_ unless the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties (collectively) have suffered or incurred Losses under such
Sections aggregating to an amount in excess of $1,000,000 (the " _Deductible_
") whereupon the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to claim
indemnification only for the amount of such Losses in excess of the Deductible
(subject to the other applicable limitations set forth herein); provided that
the Deductible shall not apply to any Losses in respect of either, (A) any
inaccuracy in or breach of any Fundamental Representation or Tax
Representation or (B) intentional fraud.

 

(iii) The Sellers shall not have any liability with respect to the Special
Indemnity Matters for any amount in excess of $18,500,000, provided to the
extent the source of liability is the Special Indemnity Matters described in
_Section 9.2(b)(v)_ , such maximum amount shall be increased to $23,500,000,
in either case in the aggregate (which applicable amount includes, for the
avoidance of doubt, the payment to Purchaser Indemnified Parties in full of
the Indemnity Escrow Amount).

 

(b) _Sole Recourse to Indemnity Escrow Account and R andW Policy; Exceptions_.

 

(i) Other than with respect to inaccuracies in or breaches of Fundamental
Representations and Tax Representations, or the intentional fraud of the
Sellers or the Company (collectively, the " _Excluded Claims_ "), the right of
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to seek indemnification from the Sellers
pursuant to _Sections 9.2(a)(i)_ or _9.2(b)(i)_  shall be limited to, and any
indemnification obligations under such Section shall be satisfied exclusively
from, the Indemnity Escrow Account. The Purchaser Parties agree and
acknowledge that, after the Closing, other than with respect to Excluded
Claims, (A) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 9.2(a)(i)_ and
_9.2(b)(i)_ , exclusively from the Indemnity Escrow Account and from the
insurer pursuant to the RandW Policy and from no other source or Person; and
(B) no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall seek any recovery from any source or
Person other than the Indemnity Escrow Account and the insurer under the RandW
Policy, except as contemplated by _Section 9.6(d)(i)_.

(ii) With respect to Excluded Claims (other than the Special Indemnity
Matters that are excluded from coverage under the terms of the RandW Policy)
and claims arising under _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_ , the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall be

 



72  required to seek recovery under this Agreement, subject to any other
applicable limitations under this _Article IX_ , (A) first from the Indemnity
Escrow Account pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and (B) second from the
insurer under the RandW Policy, and from no other source or Person (except as
contemplated by _Section 9.6(b)(v)_ and _Section 9.6(d)(i)_ ), except that:

 

The Purchaser Indemnified Parties may pursue recovery for Excluded Claims and
claims under _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_ (in each case, other than the Special
Indemnity Matters that are excluded from coverage under the terms of the RandW
Policy) directly against the Sellers, subject to the other applicable
limitations under this _Article IX_ , only to the extent that the Indemnity
Escrow Amount is not available to satisfy such Excluded Claim or claim under
_Section 9.2(b)(ii)_ and either:

 

(A) the $20,000,000 policy limit under the RandW Policy has been exceeded and
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have suffered Losses with respect to
Excluded Claims other than the Special Indemnity Matters in an amount that
exceeds such policy limit by more than $5,000,000 (the " _Excluded Claims
Deductible_ "), in which case the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall only be
entitled to pursue recovery for such Losses in excess of the sum of the policy
limit and the Excluded Claims Deductible (which sum, for avoidance of doubt,
equals $25,000,000); or

 

(B) coverage has been denied under the RandW Policy (other than as a result of
Purchasers fraud or gross negligence), Purchaser has used commercially
reasonable efforts to recover under the RandW Policy for a period of at least
120 days after receiving notice of such denial, and, if requested by the
Seller Representative, Purchaser assigns (to the extent assignable) to the
Seller Representative the right to continue to pursue coverage under the RandW
Policy with respect to the underlying claim.

 

(iii) With respect to Excluded Claims and claims under _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_ ,
for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may pursue recovery from the
Sellers pursuant to _Section 9.6(b)(ii)_ , the Sellers shall not have
aggregate liability for any amount in excess of the amount of the Final Base
Purchase Price paid by Purchaser to the Sellers. In addition, except to the
extent set forth in _Section 9.6(b)(v)_ , each Seller (individually) shall not
have any liability under this Agreement for (A) the obligations of any other
Seller hereunder for any reason, or (B) any amount in excess of the
portion of the Final Base Purchase Price paid by Purchaser to such Seller.

(iv) With respect to all claims under _Section 9.2(b)_ (including the Special
Indemnity Matters), the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be required to
seek recovery, subject to any other limitations under this _Article IX_ ,
first from the Indemnity Escrow Account. If and only to the extent the
Indemnity Escrow Account has been exhausted or disbursed, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties may thereafter pursue recovery for the Special Indemnity
Matters directly against the Sellers, subject to the other applicable
limitations under this _Article IX_ (including _Section 9.6(a)(iii)_ ).

 



73 (v) With respect to claims of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to 
_Section 9.2(b)_ that are satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Account, the
liability of the Sellers shall be joint and several. With respect to claims
pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
may pursue recovery from the Sellers the respective obligations of the A.
Davis Group and the R. Davis Group shall be several and not joint (but joint
and several as among the members of the A. Davis Group and the R. Davis Group,
respectively).

 

(vi) In the event that recovery under any insurance policy (including the RandW
Policy) by any Purchaser Party, any Acquired Company, or any of their
Affiliates with respect to any Losses for which any Purchaser Indemnified
Party has been indemnified directly by the Sellers hereunder, then a refund
equal to the aggregate amount of such recovery (net of all out-of-
pocket costs and expenses directly related to pursuing such recovery) shall
be made promptly to the Sellers Representative for the benefit of the
Sellers.

 

(c) _Special Damages_. NO CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING UNDER OR
RESULTING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT MAY BE ASSERTED BY ANY PERSON FOR PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
UNLESS A THIRD PARTY IS AWARDED SUCH DAMAGES FROM AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY IN A
THIRD PARTY CLAIM.

 

(d) _Other Limitations_.

 

(i) The amount an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to receive from the
Indemnifying Party with respect to an item of Loss shall be reduced by and
net of any recovery actually received by such Indemnified Party from any other
Person with respect to such Loss (including insurance proceeds,
indemnification rights, counterclaims, warranties, and subrogation actions).
The Purchaser Parties shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance
policies covering any Losses to the same extent as they would if such Losses
were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance
or other third party recovery is made by any Purchaser Party, any Acquired
Company, or any of their Affiliates with respect to any Losses for which any
Purchaser Indemnified Party has been indemnified by the Sellers hereunder,
then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (net of all out-
of-pocket costs and expenses directly related to pursuing such recoveries)
shall be made promptly to the Sellers Representative for the benefit of the
Sellers. The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all rights of the
Indemnified Party against other Persons in respect of any Losses indemnified
by such Indemnifying Party hereunder.

  



74 (ii) No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to receive
indemnification for any Losses to the extent such Losses are reserved or
provided for in the Final Closing Date Schedule or in the determination of the
Closing Date Net Working Capital or included in any component of Closing Date
Debt or Company Transaction Expenses.

(iii) After becoming aware of any event or occurrence that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to an indemnification right hereunder, each Person
entitled to indemnification shall take commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate all Losses arising therefrom to the extent required to do so by
Applicable Law.

 

(iv) Any indemnification obligation under this Agreement shall be determined
without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise
to such obligation constituting a breach of more than one representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder.

 

(e) For the purpose of determining (i) whether or not any breaches of
representations and warranties made in this Agreement have occurred and (ii)
Losses arising from any such breach, the representations and warranties shall
not be deemed qualified by any materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect or
other similar reference contained in or otherwise applicable to
such representation or warranty, in each case except with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.7(a)_ and _Section
4.9_.

 

Section 9.7 _Exclusive Remedies_.

 

If the Closing occurs, the remedies provided in this _Article IX_ shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedies available to any party hereto with
respect to any claim relating to this Agreement or the Transactions and the
facts and circumstances relating and pertaining hereto (whether any such claim
shall be made in contract, breach of warranty, tort or otherwise), other than
for intentional fraud and disputes required to be resolved pursuant to
_Section 2.4_ ; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not limit the
availability to any party hereto of injunctive and other equitable relief,
including specific performance. In furtherance of the foregoing, to the
extent that Purchaser Indemnified Parties suffer or incur any Losses for which
they may assert any other right to indemnification, contribution or recovery
from the Sellers under any common law or other Applicable Law, each Purchaser
Party hereby (a) waives, releases and agrees not to assert such right, and (b)
agrees to cause each of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to waive, release
and agree not to assert such right, except in the case of intentional fraud.

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_.

 

Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the rights of each other party to
consummate the Transactions are special, unique and of extraordinary
character and that, in the event that a party violates or fails and refuses to
perform any covenant or agreement made by it in this

 



75  Agreement, then each other party may be without an adequate remedy at law.
Each party agrees, therefore, that in the event it violates or fails and
refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by it in this Agreement,
each other party may, in addition to any remedies hereunder for damages or
other relief, institute and prosecute an action in any court specified in
_Section 9.4(c)_ to enforce specific performance of such covenant or
agreement or seek any other equitable relief.

Section 9.9 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. 

Any payment made after the Closing pursuant to indemnification obligations
arising under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to purchase
price for all purposes unless otherwise required by Applicable Laws.

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which shall constitute one and
the same agreement.

Section 11.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 

This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents constitute the final,
complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior written
agreements and all prior or contemporaneous oral agreements with respect to
the subject matter hereof. Except as expressly provided herein (including in 
_Section 6.9_ and _Article IX_ ), this Agreement shall not confer any third-
party beneficiary rights or remedies upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



79 Section 11.6 _Severability_.

 

Any term or provision of this Agreement that is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable in any
situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability
of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other
jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid, void or
unenforceable, the parties agree that the court or other authority making
such determination shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, area
or applicability of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid, void or unenforceable term or provision
with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest
to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

Section 11.7 _Governing Law_.

This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted, enforced and governed by and
under the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its choice of law
rules.

Section 11.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATION IN THIS
_SECTION 11.8_.

Section 11.9 _Retention of Counsel_.

 

In any dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with this
Agreement following the Closing, Sellers and the Sellers Representative
shall have the right, at its election, to retain Moore and Van Allen PLLC or
Johnston, Allison and Hord, PA to represent them in such matter, and each
Purchaser Party, for itself and the Acquired Companies, and for
their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably
consents to any such representation in any

 



80  such matter and the communication by such counsel to Sellers and the
Sellers Representative in connection with any such representation of any fact
known to such counsel arising by reason of such counsels prior
representation of any of the Acquired Companies. Each Purchaser Party, for
itself and (after the Closing) the Acquired Companies, and for their
respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, irrevocably acknowledges and
agrees that all communications between any of the Acquired Companies and such
counsel made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and Closing under, or any dispute or proceeding arising under or in
connection with, this Agreement or otherwise that, immediately prior to the
Closing, would be deemed to be privileged communications of any of the
Acquired Companies and such counsel and would not be subject to disclosure to
the Purchaser Parties in connection with any process relating to a dispute
arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement or otherwise, shall
continue after the Closing and for all purposes be deemed to be privileged
communications between Sellers and such counsel, and neither the Purchaser
Parties nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through the Purchaser
Parties shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the
privilege attaching to such communications belongs to any of the Acquired
Companies and not Sellers. Sellers and the Sellers Representative may assert
the attorney-client privilege, the work product privilege, the expectation of
client confidence and any other legal privilege or immunity against the
Purchaser Parties and (after the Closing) the Acquired Companies or any of
their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
a dispute arises after the Closing between the Purchaser Parties, the
Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and
a third party (other than a party to this Agreement or any of their respective
Affiliates) on the other hand, the Acquired Companies and the Purchaser
Parties may assert the attorney-client privilege, the work product privilege
or any other applicable privilege or immunity from disclosure to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by Moore and Van Allen PLLC
or Johnston, Allison and Hord, PA to such third party; _provided_ that none of
the Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates may waive any
such privilege without the prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative.

 

Section 11.10 _Waiver_.

 

Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the party
that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver shall be
effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on
behalf of the party waiving such term or condition. No waiver by any party of
any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall
be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other term or
condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.

Section 11.11 _Assignment_.

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
parties; provided, however _,_ that the Purchaser Parties and, following the
Closing, the Company, may assign any or all of their respective rights or
obligations hereunder to any of their respective lenders as collateral
security, in either case, without the

 



81  consent of any party hereto; provided that such an assignment shall not
relieve the Purchaser Parties of their obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

Section 11.12  _Exhibits and Schedules_.

Each Schedule and Exhibit hereto referred to in this Agreement is hereby
incorporated herein by reference and shall be deemed and construed to be a
part of this Agreement for all purposes. Any disclosure of a party made in any
Schedule that may be applicable to another Schedule shall be deemed to be made
with respect to such other Schedule, so long as it is reasonably apparent on
its face that such disclosure would also apply to such other Schedule,
notwithstanding the presence or absence of any reference in this Agreement to
the existence of such other Schedule in the representation or warranty in
which such a reference would appear, and notwithstanding the presence or
absence of any cross-reference thereto. The inclusion of any information in
any Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of the
materiality of such item, nor shall it establish a standard of materiality for
any purpose whatsoever.

Section 11.13 _Further Assurances_.

From time to time at or after the Closing Date, at the request of the other,
the Purchaser Parties and Sellers will execute and deliver such other
instruments of conveyance, assignment, transfer and delivery and take such
actions as the other reasonably may request in order to consummate, complete
and carry out the Transactions.

 

Section 11.14 _Releases_.

 

(a) Effective as of, and conditioned upon the occurrence of, the Closing, and
except as provided in _Section 11.14(c)_ , each of the Sellers, on behalf of
themselves and any Person who may be bound by the Sellers (individually, a "
_Releasing Party_ " and collectively, the " _Releasing Parties_ "), releases
each Acquired Company and its predecessors, successors and assigns and, to
the extent acting in such capacity for any Acquired Company, each of their
respective officers, directors, managers and employees (individually, a "
_Released Party_ " and collectively, the " _Released Parties_ ") from any and
all Actions, debts, liabilities, and obligations of every kind and character,
whether at Law or in equity, which such Releasing Party has or may have or has
ever had, which arise out of, relate to or are connected with any Acquired
Company with respect to periods prior to the Closing (each a " _Released
Claim_ " and together the " _Released Claims_ "), except in all cases for
fraud or the liabilities, obligations and causes of action reserved under
_Section 11.14(c)_.

(b) Each Releasing Party represents that it has made no assignment,
conveyance or transfer of any kind of any Released Claim. Each Releasing Party
acknowledges and intends that this _Section 11.14_ shall be effective as a bar
to each of the Released Claims.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 11.14_ , nothing in
this _Section 11.14_ shall prevent any Releasing Party from asserting any
contractual Action or other claim such Releasing Party may have against a
Released Party, if any, (i) arising under or for breach of this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document or other agreement or document contemplated
hereby, or in any way impair or limit any contractual obligation any Person
may have under any other written agreement, or (ii) arising with respect to
acts, events or omissions that occur after the Closing. Furthermore, to the
extent any Releasing Party is also an employee, officer or director of any
Acquired Company, the Released Claims of such Releasing Party shall not
include any Action such Releasing Party may have relating to wages or benefits
or for indemnification or advancement of expenses under the Acquired
Companies organizational documents, including to the extent available under
any insurance policies.

 



82 Section 11.15 _Interpretation_.

 

(a) _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

(b) _Use of Includes or Including_. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation."

 

(c) _References to this Agreement, Sections or Exhibits_. The words "hereof,"
"herein" and "herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise
stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement, and article, section, paragraph,
exhibit and schedule references in this Agreement are to the articles,
sections, paragraphs, exhibits and schedules of this Agreement unless
otherwise specified.

 

(d) _Grammatical Forms_. The meaning assigned to each term defined herein
shall be equally applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of such
term, and words denoting any gender shall include all genders. Where a word or
phrase is defined herein, each of its other grammatical forms shall have a
corresponding meaning. The conjunction "or" when used herein includes both
the conjunctive and the disjunctive.

(e) _References to Parties_. A reference to any party to this Agreement or
any other agreement or document shall include such partys successors and
permitted assigns.

 

(f) _References to Legislation_. A reference to any legislation or to any

counsel have mutually contributed to its drafting. Consequently, no provision

83 ARTICLE XII

 

SELLERS REPRESENTATIVE

 

Section 12.1 _Appointment_.

 

(a) Each of the Sellers authorizes and irrevocably appoints Alan P. Davis and
E. Rhyne Davis, acting jointly, as the Sellers Representative, to serve as
agent for and attorney-in-fact of such Seller (the individuals or entity
fulfilling such role, as determined by this _Section 12.1_ , the " _Sellers 
Representative_"), with full power and authority, including power of
substitution, acting in the name of, or for and on behalf of, each Seller, to
do the following: (i) deliver and receive notices with respect to any matter
under this Agreement; (ii) execute and deliver any and all documents and take
any and all such actions as shall be required or permitted of the Sellers
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, including any and all such
documents and actions with respect to the final determination of the
Closing Date Net Working Capital and Closing Date Cash pursuant to _Section
2.4_; (iii) provide notice of, demand, pursue and enforce, in its discretion,
any claim against the Purchaser Parties for a breach of this Agreement
including any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Article IX_ ; (iv) take,
in its discretion, any and all actions, and deliver and receive any and all
notices hereunder in respect of or in connection with any claim for
indemnification by any Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Article IX_

dispute with Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect thereof; (v) take, in
its discretion, any and all actions, and deliver and receive any and all
notices, under the Escrow Agreement; (v) withhold funds to pay expenses and
obligations arising in its capacity as Sellers Representative; (vi) execute
and deliver, on behalf of the Sellers, any contract, agreement, amendment or
other document or certificate, including any waiver, settlement agreement or
release of claims, to effectuate any of the foregoing or as may otherwise be
specifically permitted by this Agreement, any such contract,
agreement, amendment or other document or certificate to have the effect of
binding the Sellers as if the Sellers had personally entered into such
agreement; (vii) take all such other actions as the Sellers Representative
shall deem necessary or appropriate, in its discretion, for the
accomplishment of the foregoing and the consummation of the Transactions, and
(viii) engage such attorneys, accountants, consultants and other Persons as
the Sellers Representative, in its discretion, deems necessary or
appropriate to accomplish any action required or permitted of it hereunder.

(b) Any decision, act, consent, approval or instruction of the Sellers
Representative given or made pursuant to this _Section 12.1_ shall constitute
a decision, act, consent, approval or instruction of the Sellers, and the
Purchaser Parties and the Company shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon
any representation of the Sellers Representative with respect to any such
act, decision, consent, approval or instruction of

 



84  the Sellers. The appointment and power of attorney made in this _Section
12.1_ shall to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws be deemed an
agency coupled with an interest and all authority conferred hereby shall to
the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws be irrevocable and not be
subject to termination by operation of Applicable Laws, whether by the death
or incapacity or liquidation or dissolution of any Seller or the occurrence
of any other event or events. Any action taken by the Sellers Representative
on behalf of the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement shall be as valid as if
any such death, incapacity, liquidation, dissolution or other event had
not occurred, regardless of whether or not the Sellers Representative, the
Company or the Purchaser Parties shall have received notice of any such death,
incapacity, liquidation, dissolution or other event.

 

(c) The Sellers Representative shall have the sole and exclusive right to
handle the foregoing matters for which the Sellers Representative has been
appointed the exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact of the Sellers. No Seller
(other than, if applicable, the Sellers Representative) shall have any right
to participate in the resolution of such matters in any manner.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 12.1_ to the contrary, (i) the
Sellers Representative shall not be permitted to enter into any amendment to
this Agreement or other Transaction Document that increases the amount of, or

Seller hereunder or thereunder in any manner without the prior written
consent of such Seller, (ii) the Sellers Representative shall not be
permitted to bind any Seller or its Affiliates to a substantive, non-monetary
obligation, covenant or restriction without the prior written consent of such
Seller, and (iii) with respect to an indemnification claim pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)_ by a Purchaser Indemnified Party against a specific Seller,
such Seller (and not the Sellers Representative) shall act as
the Indemnifying Party hereunder for all purposes, including with respect to
the defense thereof; _provided_ , that nothing in this subclause (iii) shall
be deemed to result in or create any limitation whatsoever on the rights of
any Purchaser Indemnified Party, including with respect to the effectiveness
of any notice given in accordance with any notice provision in this Agreement.

 



85 Section 12.2 _Sellers  Representative Fund_.

 

(a) The Sellers Representative Fund will be available for use by the Sellers
Representative in its discretion following the Closing for the payment of all
costs and expenses incurred by the Sellers Representative in connection with
the exercise by it of the authority granted to it herein (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, the fees and expenses of
any accountants or other professional advisors retained by the Sellers
Representative and any portion of the fees and expenses of the Neutral
Accountant for which the Sellers Representative is liable hereunder). The
Sellers Representative in its discretion may also use the Sellers
Representative Fund to satisfy any finally determined obligations that are
required to be satisfied by the Sellers, including pursuant to  _Section
2.4(e)_.

(b) Any portion of the Sellers Representative Fund remaining after the
Expiration Date (or, if later, upon the final resolution of all claims
asserted against the Indemnity Escrow Account), after payment of any costs and
expenses incurred by the Sellers Representative through such date and of any
other obligations of the Sellers as of such date pursuant to this _Article
XII_ shall be distributed to the Sellers in accordance with their respective
Allocation Percentages. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior
to the final distribution of any remaining funds in the Indemnity Escrow
Account to the Sellers, the Sellers Representative shall be permitted to be
reimbursed out of such remaining funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account for any
and all reasonable costs and expenses of the Sellers Representative in
excess of the remaining portion of the Sellers Representative Fund at such
time. In furtherance of the foregoing, upon request of the Sellers
Representative prior to the final distribution of the remaining funds in
the Indemnity Escrow Account to the Sellers, the Sellers Representative and
Purchaser shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a written instruction to the
Escrow Agent to release to the Sellers Representative an amount equal to its
reasonable costs and expenses in excess of the remaining portion of the
Sellers Representative Fund out of funds otherwise distributable to the
Sellers.

 

Section 12.3 _Substitute Appointment_.

 

In the event of the death, incapacity, liquidation, or dissolution of any
Person or entity serving as the Sellers Representative, as applicable, the
Sellers Representative (or its trustee, receiver or personal representative)
shall promptly designate a substitute and provide written notice to Purchaser
and the Sellers of such substitute, which substitute shall from the time of
such designation have all the rights and responsibilities of the Sellers
Representative hereunder.

Section 12.4 _Reliance by Sellers  Representative_.

As between the Sellers Representative and the other Sellers, the
Sellers Representative shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected against the other Sellers in relying upon any statements furnished
to it by any Seller, the Purchaser Parties or, following the Closing, the 

 



86  Company, and the Sellers Representative shall be entitled to act on the
advice of counsel selected by it and shall not be liable to any Seller for any
action or inaction done in good faith by the Sellers Representative based on
such advice.

Section 12.5 _No Liability of Sellers  Representative_. 

The Sellers Representative will not be liable to the Sellers for any action
taken by the Sellers Representative in good faith without gross negligence
or willful misconduct, and the Sellers shall severally (and not jointly), in
accordance with their respective Allocation Percentages, indemnify the
Sellers Representative from any Losses arising out of service in its
capacity as the Sellers Representative hereunder, except to the extent such
Losses are incurred due to the intentional misconduct or bad faith of the
Sellers Representative. The Sellers Representative is serving in
such capacity solely for purposes of administrative convenience, and is not
personally liable in such capacity for any of the obligations of the Sellers
hereunder, and the Purchaser Parties agree on behalf of itself and all
Purchaser Indemnified Parties not to look to the assets of the Sellers
Representative, in such capacity, for the satisfaction of any obligations of
the Sellers hereunder. In no event shall the Sellers Representative be liable
to any Seller for indirect, punitive, special or consequential damages.
