(i) Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement ("Closing Working Capital
Statement"), calculated in a manner consistent with the sample calculation of
Working Capital in Schedule 2.04(a), setting forth its calculation of Closing
Working Capital and the final amount of Cash as of the opening of business on
the Closing Date (the "Final Cash Amount"), which statement shall contain a
balance sheet of the Target Companies, on a consolidated basis, as of the
Closing Date (without giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein),
and a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of Buyer that the Closing
Working Capital Statement was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied using
the same accounting methods, practices, principles, policies and procedures,
with consistent classifications, judgments and valuation and estimation
methodologies that were used in the preparation of the Audited Financial
Statements for the most recent fiscal year end as if such Closing Working
Capital Statement was being prepared and audited as of a fiscal year end.

(ii) The "Post-Closing Adjustment" shall be an amount equal to the Closing
Working Capital _plus_ the Final Cash Amount _minus_ the Estimated Closing
Working Capital _minus_ the Estimated Cash Amount. If the Post-
Closing Adjustment is a positive number, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount
equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a
negative number, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Post-Closing
Adjustment.

 

(c) _Examination and Review_.

 

(i) _Examination_. After receipt of the Closing Working Capital Statement,
Seller shall have forty-five (45) days (the "Review Period") to review the
Closing Working Capital Statement. During the Review Period, Seller and
Sellers Accountants shall have full access to the books and records of the
Target Companies, the personnel of,

 



16  and work papers prepared by, Buyer and/or Buyers Accountants to the extent
that they relate to the Closing Working Capital Statement and to such
historical financial information (to the extent in Buyers possession)
relating to the Closing Working Capital Statement as Seller may reasonably
request for the purpose of reviewing the Closing Working Capital Statement and
to prepare a Statement of Objections, _provided, that_  such access shall be
in a manner that does not interfere with the normal business operations of
Buyer or the Target Companies.

 

(ii) _Objection_. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, Seller
may object to the Closing Working Capital Statement by delivering to Buyer a
written statement setting forth Sellers objections in reasonable detail,
indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for Sellers
disagreement therewith (the "Statement of Objections"). If Seller fails to
deliver the Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review
Period, the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Post-Closing Adjustment,
as the case may be, reflected in the Closing Working Capital Statement shall
be deemed to have been accepted by Seller. If Seller delivers the Statement of
Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, Buyer and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections within thirty (30) days
after the delivery of the Statement of Objections (the "Resolution Period"),
and, if the same are so resolved within the Resolution Period, the Post-
Closing Adjustment and the Closing Working Capital Statement with such
changes as may have been previously agreed in writing by Buyer and Seller,
shall be final and binding.

 

(iii) _Resolution of Disputes_. If Seller and Buyer fail to reach an
agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of
Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any amounts
remaining in dispute ("Disputed Amounts" and any amounts not so disputed, the
"Undisputed Amounts") shall be submitted for resolution to the office of an
impartial nationally recognized firm of independent certified public
accountants selected by Buyer and Seller other than Sellers Accountants or
Buyers Accountants (the "Independent Accountant") who, acting as experts and
not arbitrators, shall resolve the Disputed Amounts only and make any
adjustments to the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, and the
Closing Working Capital Statement. If Disputed Amounts are submitted to the
Independent Accountant, Seller and Buyer shall each furnish to the Independent
Accountant such work papers, schedules and other documents and information
relating to the Disputed Amounts as the Independent Accountant may reasonably
request. The Independent Accountant shall resolve the Disputed Amounts based
solely on the applicable definitions and other terms in this Agreement and the
presentations by Seller and Buyer, and not by independent review. The parties
hereto agree that all adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality.
The Independent Accountant shall only decide the specific items under dispute
by the parties and their decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the
range of values assigned to each such item in the Closing Working Capital
Statement and the Statement of Objections, respectively. The determination of
Disputed Amounts by the Independent Accountant shall be final and binding on
the parties.

(iv) _Fees of the Independent Accountant_. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be paid by Seller, on the one hand, and by Buyer,
on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the amount actually
contested but not awarded to Seller or Buyer, respectively, bears to the
aggregate amount actually contested by Seller and Buyer. For example, should
the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Independent Accountant
awards $600 in favor of the Sellers position, 60% of the costs of its review
would be borne by Buyer and 40% of the costs would be borne by Seller.

 



17 (v) _Determination by Independent Accountant_. The Independent Accountant
shall make a determination as soon as practicable within thirty (30) days (or
such other time as the parties hereto shall agree in writing) after their
engagement, and their resolution of the Disputed Amounts and
their adjustments to the Closing Working Capital Statement and/or the Post-
Closing Adjustment shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.

 

(vi) _Payments of Post-Closing Adjustment_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any payment of the Post-Closing Adjustment shall (A) be due (x)
within five (5) Business Days of acceptance of the Closing Working Capital
Statement or (y) if there are Disputed Amounts, then within five (5) Business
Days of the resolution described in clause (v) above; and (B) be paid as
follows: (1) if payable by Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the same account of Seller that the Closing Payment was wired at the
Closing and (2) if payable by Seller, such amount shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer to
Seller.

Section 2.05 _338(g) Make-Whole Payment_. If Buyer chooses to make a
Section 338(g) Election with respect to any one or more of the foreign Company
Subsidiaries as authorized pursuant to Section 6.05(b), then the Purchase
Price shall be increased to fully compensate Seller for the estimated increase
in Tax liability attributable to the Section 338(g) Election with respect to
such foreign Company Subsidiaries (the "338(g) Make-Whole Payment"). The
determination of the amount of the 338(g) Make-Whole Payment with respect to
any foreign Company Subsidiary shall be governed by the following provisions:

 

(a) _Initial Exploratory Process Controlled by Buyer_. From and after the
Closing, Buyer may engage its professional tax advisers to organize, review
and analyze the tax and other records of any of the foreign Company
Subsidiaries as may be necessary to estimate the 338(g) Make-Whole Payment for
such foreign Company Subsidiaries.

 

(b) _Seller s Cooperation Upon Request of Buyer_. From time to time after
the Closing, upon request of Buyer, but subject to Section 2.05(g), Seller
will, and will cause its tax advisors to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer and
Buyers tax advisers in connection with the efforts described in Section
2.05(a) to estimate the 338(g) Make-Whole Payment for any foreign Company
Subsidiaries. Sellers cooperation will include, upon request, (i) providing
to Buyer or Buyers tax advisers information or data relating to any foreign
Company Subsidiaries that may be in the possession of Seller or Sellers tax
advisers, (ii) reviewing preliminary, informal drafts of estimates of the
338(g) Make-Whole Payments for any foreign Company Subsidiaries that may be
provided to Seller and (iii) providing non-binding cooperative comments with
respect to any such preliminary, informal drafts of the estimated 338(g) Make-
Whole Payments to assist in developing an estimate of the 338(g) Make-Whole
Payment for any foreign Company Subsidiary that is more likely to be mutually
acceptable to Buyer and Seller.

(c) _Technical Requirements for the Calculation of the 338(g) Make-Whole
Payment_. For purposes of calculating the 338(g) Make-Whole Payment, the Tax
liability estimated to be incurred by Seller in the transaction contemplated
hereunder with one or more Section 338(g) Elections shall be compared to the
Tax liability estimated to be incurred by Seller in a hypothetical benchmark
transaction without any Section 338(g) Elections, assuming that, with respect
to the hypothetical benchmark transaction and notwithstanding anything in the
Allocation Schedule to the contrary, the following statements are accurate:

 

(i) the Company made a Section 338(h)(10) Election pursuant to Section
6.05(a);

 



18 (ii) Buyer complied with Section 6.05(d) with regard to distributions and
deemed distributions by foreign Company Subsidiaries prior to January 1, 2017;
and

 

(iii) a portion of the Tax Consideration was allocated to the Old
Receivables held by the foreign Company Subsidiaries without any discount (
_i.e_., at book value).

(d) _Buyer s Formal Proposal of a 338(g) Make-Whole Payment_. At any
time after the Closing, Buyer may provide to Seller a written statement ("338
Statement") setting forth an estimated amount of the 338(g) Make-Whole Payment
with respect to a Section 338(g) Election for any designated Company
Subsidiaries. The 338 Statement must include the elements of the calculation
of the 338(g) Make-Whole Payment as described in Section 2.05(c).

 

(e) _Examination and Review_.

 

(i) _Examination_. After receipt of a 338(g) Statement, Seller shall have
sixty (60) days from the date the 338(g) Statement is received or until May
15, 2017, whichever is later (the "338 Review Period") to review the 338
Statement. During the 338 Review Period, Seller and Sellers tax advisers
shall have full access to the books and records of the Target Companies, the
personnel of, and work papers prepared by, Buyer and/or Buyers tax advisers
to the extent that they relate to the 338 Statement and to such historical
financial information (to the extent in Buyers possession) relating to the
338 Statement as Seller may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing
the 338 Statement and to prepare a 338 Statement of Objections, _provided,
that_ such access shall be in a manner that does not interfere with the
normal business operations of Buyer or the Target Companies.

 

(ii) _Objection_. On or prior to the last day of the 338 Review Period,
Seller may object to the 338 Statement by delivering to Buyer a written
statement setting forth Sellers objections in reasonable detail, indicating
each disputed item or amount and the basis for Sellers disagreement therewith
(the "338 Statement of Objections"). If Seller fails to deliver the 338
Statement of Objections before the expiration of the 338 Review Period, the
338(g) Make-Whole Payment reflected in the 338 Statement shall be deemed to
have been accepted by Seller. If Seller delivers the 338 Statement of
Objections before the expiration of the 338 Review Period, Buyer and Seller
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections within fifteen (15)
days after the delivery of the 338 Statement of Objections (the "338
Resolution Period"), and, if the same are so resolved within the 338
Resolution Period, the 338(g) Make-Whole Payment, with such changes as may
have been previously agreed in writing by Buyer and Seller, shall be final
and binding.

(iii) _Buyer s Option_. If Seller and Buyer fail to reach an agreement
with respect to all of the matters set forth in the 338 Statement of
Objections before expiration of the 338 Resolution Period, then Buyer may
elect, by notice to Seller, to (A) withdraw the proposal to make the Section
338(g) Election or (B) seek a resolution of any amounts remaining in dispute
as provided in Section 2.05(e)(iv).

 



19 (iv) _Resolution of Disputes_. If Buyer makes the election pursuant to
Section 2.05(e)(iii)(B), then any amounts remaining in dispute ("338 Disputed
Amounts" and any amounts not so disputed, the "338 Undisputed Amounts") shall
be submitted for resolution to the office of an impartial nationally
recognized firm of independent certified public accountants selected by Buyer
and Seller other than Sellers Accountants or Buyers Accountants (the "338
Independent Accountant") who, acting as experts and not arbitrators, shall
resolve the 338 Disputed Amounts only and make any adjustments to the 338(g)
Make-Whole Payment. If the 338 Disputed Amounts are submitted to the 338
Independent Accountant, Seller and Buyer shall each furnish to the 338
Independent Accountant such work papers, schedules and other documents and
information relating to the 338 Disputed Amounts as the 338 Independent
Accountant may reasonably request. The 338 Independent Accountant shall
resolve the 338 Disputed Amounts based solely on the applicable definitions
and other terms in this Agreement and the presentations by Seller and Buyer,
and not by independent review. The parties hereto agree that all adjustments
shall be made without regard to materiality. The 338 Independent Accountant
shall only decide the specific items under dispute by the parties and their
decision for each 338 Disputed Amount must be within the range of values
assigned to each such item in the 338 Statement and the 338 Statement of
Objections, respectively.

(v) _Fees of the Independent Accountant_. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be paid by Buyer.

 

(vi) _Determination by Independent Accountant_. The Independent Accountant
shall make a determination as soon as practicable within thirty (30) days (or
such other time as the parties hereto shall agree in writing) after their
engagement, and their resolution of the 338(g) Make-Whole Payment shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.

(f) _Payment of 338(g) Make-Whole Payment Under Dispute_. If (x)
Seller has provided a 338 Statement of Objections for any 338 Statement and
(y) the 338 Disputed Amounts have not yet been resolved in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.05(e), then Buyer shall have the right to make the
Section 338(g) Election described in such 338 Statement by paying to Seller a
338(g) Make-Whole Payment that meets the requirements in the 338 Statement of
Objections; _provided, however_ , if the finally determined 338(g) Make-Whole
Payment should later be determined, pursuant to the provisions of Section
2.05(e), to be less than the amount paid by Buyer to Seller, then Seller shall
refund to Buyer the amount by which the payment to Seller exceeds such finally
determined 338(g) Make-Whole Payment.

(g) _Post-Closing 338(g) Professional Fees_. Buyer shall pay and
reimburse to Seller all Post-Closing 338(g) Professional Fees. Seller shall
provide, from time to time, to Buyer copies of underlying invoices or other
reasonably requested documents evidencing the amount of any Post-Closing
338(g) Professional Fees, and Buyer shall, within thirty (30) days following
receipt of any such invoices or other documents, reimburse Seller for the
amount of such Post-Closing 338(g) Professional Fees.

 

Section 2.06 _Adjustments for Tax Purposes_. Any payments made pursuant to
Sections 2.04 and 2.05 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Tax
Consideration to the extent applicable, unless otherwise required by Law.

Section 2.07 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the purchase and sale of the Shares contemplated hereby shall take
place at a closing (the "Closing") to be held at 10:00 a.m.,

 



20  no later than two (2) Business Days after the last of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Article VII have been satisfied or waived by the party
entitled to waive the same (other than conditions which, by their nature, are
to be satisfied on the Closing Date), at the offices of Gardere Wynne Sewell
LLP, 2000 Wells Fargo Plaza, 1000 Louisiana Street, Houston, TX 77002, or at
such other time or on such other date or at such other place as Seller and
Buyer may mutually agree upon in writing (the day on which the Closing takes
place being the "Closing Date").

 

Section 2.08 _Old Receivables List_. On the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a complete and reasonably detailed list (the "Old
Receivables List") of all receivables of the Target Companies that are more
than one hundred twenty (120) days old from invoice date as of the open of
business on the Closing Date (the "Old Receivables").

owned or leased by the Target Companies, together with all other properties
and assets of the Target Companies, are sufficient for the continued conduct
of the business of the Target Companies after the Closing in substantially
the same manner as conducted prior to the Closing and constitute all of the

Companies after Closing in substantially the same manner as conducted prior to

certificates, office actions, correspondence and other materials related to
all Company IP Registrations.

(b) Section 3.12(b) of the Disclosure Schedules lists all Company IP

such Company IP Agreements, including all modifications, amendments and

for such breaches or defaults that would not result in a Material Loss to the
Target Companies. No Target Company has provided or received any notice of
breach or default of or any intention to terminate, any Company IP Agreement.

(c) The Target Companies are the sole and exclusive legal and beneficial,
and with respect to the Company IP Registrations, record owner of all right,
title and interest in and to, all

 



29  of the Owned Company Intellectual Property that is material to the current
business or operations of the Target Companies, and have the valid right to
use all other Intellectual Property used by any Target Companies that is
material to the current business or operations of the Target Companies, in
each case, free and clear of Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances.

 

(d) The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder will not
result in the loss or impairment of or payment of any additional amounts with
respect to, nor require the consent of any other Person in respect of, the
right of the Target Companies to own, use or hold for use any Intellectual
Property as owned, used or held for use in the conduct of the business or
operations of the Target Companies as currently conducted, except where any
such loss, impairment, payment of additional amounts or failure to obtain such
required consent would not result in the Target Companies incurring or
suffering a Material Loss.

(e) The rights of the Target Companies in the Company Intellectual
Property are valid, subsisting and enforceable in all material respects. The
Target Companies have taken all reasonable steps to maintain the Company
Intellectual Property and to protect and preserve the confidentiality of all
trade secrets included in the Company Intellectual Property. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Companys trade names, "TIW" and "Texas
Iron Works", are the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and none of
the Seller Parties owns or claims any ownership interest in, or any right to
use, such trade name.

 

(f) The conduct of the business of the Target Companies as currently and
formerly conducted, and the products, processes and services of the Target
Companies, have not infringed, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise violated,
and do not currently infringe, dilute, misappropriate or otherwise violate the
Intellectual Property or other rights of any Person, except where any such
infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation would not result
in the Target Companies incurring or suffering a Material Loss. Except as set
forth on Section 3.12(g) of the Disclosure Schedules, to Sellers Knowledge,
no Person has infringed, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise violated, or is
currently infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating, any
Company Intellectual Property.

 

(g) Except as set forth on Section 3.12(g) of the Disclosure Schedules,
there are no Actions (including any oppositions, interferences or re-

of offers to obtain a license): (i) alleging any infringement,
misappropriation, dilution or violation of the Intellectual Property of any
Person by any of the Target Companies; (ii) challenging the validity,
enforceability, registrability or ownership of any Company Intellectual
Property or the rights of the Target Companies with respect to any Company
Intellectual Property; or (iii) by any of the Target Companies or any other
Person alleging any infringement, misappropriation, dilution or violation by
any Person of the Company Intellectual Property. The Target Companies are not
subject to any outstanding or prospective Governmental Order (including any
motion or petition therefor) that does or would restrict or impair the use of
any Company Intellectual Property.

 

Section 3.13 _Inventory_. All inventory of the Target Companies reflected
in the Interim Balance Sheet consists of a quality and quantity usable and
salable in the Ordinary Course of Business, except for obsolete, damaged,
defective or slow-moving items that have been written off or written down to
fair market value or for which adequate reserves have been established. All
such inventory is owned by the Target Companies free and clear of all
Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances, and no inventory is held on a
consignment basis. The quantities of each item of inventory (whether raw
materials, work-in-process or finished goods) are not excessive, but are
reasonable in the present circumstances of the Target Companies. Section 3.13
of the Disclosure Schedules contains a true and correct list of all inventory
of the GE Hydril Line of Products owned by the Target Companies.

accounts receivable arising after the Interim Balance Sheet Date and up to
and including the Closing Date, on the accounting records of the Company, are
collectible in full within sixty (60) days from due date. The reserve for bad
debts shown on the Interim Balance Sheet or, with respect to
accounts receivable arising after the Interim Balance Sheet Date and up to
and including the Closing Date, on the accounting records of the Company have
been determined in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, subject to

consideration paid by each Material Customer during such periods. No Target

its goods or services or to otherwise terminate or materially reduce its
relationship with such Target Company.

copies of such Insurance Policies have been made available to Buyer. Neither
the Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including the Target Companies) has

premiums due on such Insurance Policies have either been paid or, if due and
payable prior to Closing, will be paid prior to Closing in accordance with
the payment terms of

part of any of the Target Companies. To Sellers Knowledge, all such
Insurance Policies (a) are valid and binding in accordance with their terms;
(b) are provided by carriers who are financially solvent; and (c) have not

Sellers Knowledge, no event has occurred or circumstances exist that may
reasonably be expected to give rise to, or serve as a basis for, any claim on
any Insurance Policy that has not been submitted to the insurer under such
Insurance Policy, except where the failure to so submit would not result in
the Target Companies incurring or suffering a Material Loss.

 

Section 3.17 _Legal Proceedings; Governmental Orders_.

 

(a) There are no Actions, excluding Actions involving environmental

consulting, profit-sharing, deferred compensation, incentive, bonus,
performance award, phantom equity, stock or stock-based, change in control,

other similar agreement, plan, policy, program or arrangement, in each case
whether or not reduced to writing and whether funded or unfunded, including
each "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA,
whether or not tax-qualified and whether or not subject to ERISA, which is
maintained, sponsored, contributed to, or required to be contributed to by any

may have any Liability, or with respect to which Buyer or any of its
Affiliates would reasonably be expected to have any Liability, contingent or
otherwise (as listed on Section 3.20(a) of the Disclosure Schedules, each, a
"Benefit Plan"). The Seller has separately identified in Section 3.20(a) of
the Disclosure Schedules (i) each Benefit Plan that contains a change in
control provision and (ii) each Benefit Plan that is maintained, sponsored,
contributed to, or required to be contributed to by any of the Target

correctly sets forth the CIC Plan Amount.

(b) With respect to each Benefit Plan, Seller has made available to Buyer
accurate, current and complete copies of each of the following: (i) where the
Benefit Plan has been reduced to writing, the plan document together with all
amendments; (ii) where the Benefit Plan has not been reduced to writing, a

and any applicable local Laws). Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (a "Qualified Benefit Plan") is so

rely on an opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the prototype
plan sponsor, to the effect that such Qualified Benefit Plan is so qualified
and that the plan and the trust related thereto are exempt from federal
income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and
nothing has occurred that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any Qualified Benefit Plan. Nothing has occurred with
respect to any Benefit Plan that has subjected or could reasonably be expected
to subject any of the Target Companies or any of their ERISA Affiliates or,
with respect to any period on or after the Closing Date, Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, to a penalty under Section 502 of ERISA or to a tax or penalty
under Section 4975 of the Code other than any such penalty or tax that will
not result in the Target Companies suffering or incurring a Material Loss.
All benefits, contributions and premiums relating to each Benefit Plan have

applicable Laws and accounting principles, and all benefits accrued under any
unfunded Benefit Plan have been paid, accrued or otherwise adequately
reserved to the extent required by, and in accordance with, GAAP.

 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has (i) incurred or

provisions of the Code or applicable local Law relating to Benefit Plans;
(ii) failed to timely pay premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation; (iii) withdrawn from any Benefit Plan; or (iv) engaged in any

(e) With respect to each Benefit Plan (i) no such plan is a Multiemployer
Plan, and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any
withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA which remains unsatisfied; (ii)

413(c) of the Code or a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined
in Section 3(40) of ERISA); (iii) no Action has been initiated by the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation to terminate any such plan or to appoint a
trustee for any such plan; (iv) no such plan is subject to the minimum

in Section 4043 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any such plan.

 

(f) None of the Target Companies has any commitment or obligation and has
not made any representations to any employee, officer, director, independent
contractor or consultant, whether or not legally binding, to adopt, amend,

Agreement or otherwise.

 



36 (g) Other than as required under Section 601 et. seq. of ERISA or other
applicable Law or except as set forth on Section 3.20(g) of the Disclosure
Schedules, no Benefit Plan provides post-termination or retiree welfare
benefits to any individual for any reason, and neither the Company nor any of
its ERISA Affiliates has any Liability to provide post-termination or retiree
welfare benefits to any individual or ever represented, promised or contracted
to any individual that such individual would be provided with post-termination
or retiree welfare benefits.

(h) With respect to each Benefit Plan, there have been no violations of
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, Section 4980B of the Code or Sections 601 through
608 of ERISA, other than any violations that will not result in the Target
Companies suffering or incurring a Material Loss.

thereunder. None of the Target Companies has any obligation to gross up,
indemnify or otherwise reimburse any individual for any excise taxes, interest
or penalties incurred pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

 

(k) Each individual who is classified by any of the Target Companies as an
independent contractor has been properly classified for purposes of
participation and benefit accrual under each Benefit Plan, other than
misclassifications that would not, on a combined basis, result in the Target
Companies suffering or incurring a Material Loss.

 

(l) Except as required by applicable Law or as otherwise set forth on
Section 3.20(l) of the Disclosure Schedules, neither the execution of this
Agreement nor any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
(either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events):
(i) entitle any current or former director, officer, employee, independent
contractor or consultant of any of the Target Companies to severance pay or
any other payment; (ii) accelerate the time of payment, funding or vesting, or
increase the amount of compensation due to any such individual; (iii) limit

maintained in compliance with its terms and with all applicable foreign Laws,

basis, result in the Target Companies suffering or incurring a Material Loss.
All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans that are intended to be funded and/or book-
reserved are funded and/or book-reserved, as appropriate, based upon
reasonable actuarial assumptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of

the Seller Parties to not, directly or indirectly, solicit or entice, or

Section 5.07 would give rise to irreparable harm to Buyer, for which monetary
damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event
of a breach or a threatened breach by Seller of any such obligations, Buyer
shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be
available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to equitable relief,
including a temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific performance
and any other relief that may be available from a court of competent
jurisdiction (without any requirement to post bond).

 



47 (e) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section
5.07 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer
and constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that
any covenant contained in this Section 5.07 should ever be adjudicated by a
court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the time, geographic, product or
service, or other limitations permitted by applicable Law in any
jurisdiction, then such court is expressly empowered to reform such covenant,
and such covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the
maximum time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations permitted
by applicable Law. The covenants contained in this Section 5.07 and each

provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or
provision in any other jurisdiction.

responses thereto. Subject to the provisions of Section 5.08(g), the parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as may be

communications with any Governmental Authority relating to this Agreement and
the Transaction Documents, (iv) if any Governmental Authority initiates an

outside economic consultants of the recipient and will not be disclosed by
such outside counsel or outside economic consultants to employees, officers,
or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the party
providing such materials.

 

(f) If any consent, approval or authorization necessary to preserve any
right or benefit under any Contract to which any of the Target Companies is a
party is not obtained prior to the Closing, Seller shall, subsequent to the
Closing, cooperate with Buyer and the Target Companies in attempting to obtain
such consent, approval or authorization as promptly thereafter as

to this Section 5.18 after payment of the amount required to be paid pursuant
to clause (x) of this Section 5.18(f)(i).

 

(ii) Buyer may elect to cause the Company to assign to Seller all of the
Old Receivables to the extent of the remaining unpaid balances thereof;
_provided, however_ , such assignment shall be made without any warranty other
than a warranty of title that no Encumbrances on the Old Receivables have been
created after the Closing by, through or under Buyer, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates (except for any Encumbrances created with the

without Buyers written consent, transfer or assign all or any portion of the
Old Receivables to an Affiliate of Seller, _provided, further, however_ ,
Seller shall not, upon any such assignment to an Affiliate of Seller, be
released from the obligation to comply, or cause its assignee to comply, with
the covenants in this Section 5.15(f)(ii) with respect to the Old Receivables;

 



53 (B) file a lawsuit, arbitral proceeding or other legal action against any
account debtor in connection with the efforts to collect any Old Receivables;
or

 

(C) in exercising any collection efforts with respect to the Old

reasonably expected to damage the business or operations of the Company or
Buyer.

If Buyer elects the option in this Section 5.18(f)(ii), then Buyer will have
no further obligations to Seller pursuant to this Section 5.18 after
completion of the assignment of the Old Receivables by Buyer to Seller;
_provided, however,_ that with respect to any amounts received by Buyer on an
Old Receivable following the assignment to Seller of such Old Receivable
pursuant to this Section 5.18(f)(ii), Buyer shall pay 50% of such amounts to
Seller within ten (10) Business Days of Buyers receipt thereof.

(iii) Buyer may elect to retain ownership of the Old Receivables
and indefinitely thereafter, for as long as any Old Receivables remain

Old Receivables. 

(g) _Failure to Make Election_. For those amounts received on the Old
Receivables during the Old Receivables Option Period, Buyer shall pay 50% of
such amounts to Seller. If Buyer should fail to provide written notice to
Seller by the end of the Old Receivables Option Period as to which of the
options in Section 5.18(f) that Buyer has elected to choose, then Buyer shall
be deemed to have elected to choose the option in Section 5.18(f)(iii).

 

(h) _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. Any payments made pursuant to Section
5.18 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Tax Consideration to the extent
applicable, unless otherwise required by Law.

 

(i) _Right of Set-Off_. If, at the time any payment is due and payable by
Buyer to Seller under this Section 5.18, there are payments for Losses due
and payable (or indemnification claims for Losses that have been properly
asserted in writing by Buyer in good faith but not yet resolved) by Seller to
Buyer under Article VI or VIII, and the aggregate amount of all such Losses
exceeds the remaining balance of the Escrow Amount (such amount of Losses in
excess of the remaining balance of the Escrow Amount, the "Allowed Set-Off
Amount"), then Buyer shall have the right to offset, up to an amount not to
exceed the Allowed Set-Off Amount, against any payment otherwise due and
payable to Seller under this Section 5.18 by:

 

(i) applying the Allowed Set-Off Amount towards the payment of any Losses
which have been resolved pursuant to the indemnification obligations of
Seller set forth in Article VI or Article VIII and which are currently due and
payable by Seller to any Buyer Indemnitee; or

 



54 (ii) depositing the Allowed Set-Off Amount into the Escrow Account (if it
is still in place) or into a new escrow account with the Escrow Agent on
substantially the same terms as applied to the Escrow Account (if the Escrow
Account has been previously terminated).

 

The subsequent disbursement of any amounts deposited in a new escrow account
pursuant to this Section 5.18(i) shall be governed by the provisions of
Section 8.09(b) in the same manner as if such new escrow account was the
Escrow Account.

Section 5.19 _Closing Date Income Tax Receivables_. From and after the
Closing, Buyer shall, upon request of Seller from time to time, provide
reasonable assistance in collecting any and all Closing Date Income
Tax Receivables. If Buyer or the Target Companies should receive payment of

following receipt thereof.

(a) Seller shall, prior to the Closing Date, (A) cause the Company to (i)
transfer the Seller Office Building, the Corpus Christi Property and the 5151
Gasmer Property to Seller or other designees of Seller, in each case on an AS

approved by Buyer (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) in which the Company provides neither a warranty of
title nor any warranty of condition or habitability and (ii) distribute to
Seller the Vehicles on an AS IS, WHERE IS basis pursuant to an instrument of
assignment approved by Buyer (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) in which the Company provides neither a
warranty of title nor any warranty of condition and (B) otherwise cause the
Target Companies to transfer all other Excluded Assets to Seller or its
Affiliates. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Companys transfer of
the Excluded Assets shall be treated as a distribution to Seller in accordance
with a plan of liquidation that also relates to and includes the deemed
distribution to Seller arising as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election,
in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(4).

(i) Cause TIW Canada to transfer and assign all of its existing inventory
(whether raw materials, work-in-process or finished goods) associated with
the GE Hyrdril Line of Products to Waukesha-Pearce or other designees of
Seller on an AS IS, WHERE IS basis pursuant to an instrument of assignment
approved by Buyer (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) in which the Company provides neither a warranty of
title nor any warranty of condition, _provided that_ such transferee entity
shall agree to assume all liabilities and obligations attributable to the
transferred inventory, whether arising before, on, or after the date of such
transfer and assignment;

 

(ii) Cause TIW Canada to terminate, at the sole cost, risk and expense of
Seller, employment of Darrell Faryna (a current TIW Canada employee

him; and

 



55 (iii) Cause TIW Canada to transfer and assign the franchise of the GE
Hydril Line of Products and all related Contracts to Waukesha-Pearce or a new

5151 Gasmer Property to the Company for a term of six months.

Section 5.22 _Relocation of Corpus Christi Inventory and Equipment_. Prior
to the Closing, Seller will cause all of the Companys inventory and

3.22; (b) any Loss attributable to any breach or violation of, or failure to
fully perform, any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation in this
Article VI; (c) all Taxes of any of the Target Companies or relating to the

(a) in the case of Taxes (i) based upon, or related to, income, receipts,
profits, wages, capital or net worth, (ii) imposed in connection with the
sale, transfer or assignment of property, or (iii) required to be withheld,
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended
with the Closing Date; and

 

(b) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for

number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of

Section 6.05 _Section 338 Elections_ _._

 

(a) _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. A timely election under Section

a "Section 338(g) Election"). Buyer and Seller agree to file all applicable
Tax Returns consistent with each such Section 338(g) Election, if any.

Election (and any Section 338(g) Election, if applicable), Seller and Buyer
agree that the Tax Consideration shall be allocated among the assets of the
Company for all applicable income Tax purposes (the "Allocation Schedule"). A
draft of the Allocation Schedule shall be prepared by Buyer and delivered to
Seller within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date. If Seller notifies
Buyer in writing that Seller objects to one or more items reflected in the
Allocation Schedule, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve such dispute; _provided, however_ , that if Seller and Buyer are
unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the Allocation Schedule within
sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, such dispute shall be resolved by
the Independent Accountant. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm
shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. Buyer, the Target Companies and
Seller shall file all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims
for refund) and information reports in a manner consistent with the

Section 6.06 _Contests_ _._  

(a) _Notice of Tax Claims._ Each party will promptly notify the other
party in writing upon receipt by such party (or any of its Affiliates) of
written notice of any pending or threatened audit, examination or proceeding
by a Governmental Authority in respect of which an indemnity may be sought
pursuant to this Article VI (a "Tax Claim"); _provided, however_ , the
failure of a party to give prompt notice shall not relieve the other party of
any of its obligations under this Article VI except to the extent the other
party can demonstrate actual prejudice as a result of such failure.

(b) _Tax Claims_ _for Pre-Closing Periods._ Seller may, at its own
expense, participate in, and upon written notice to Buyer, assume the defense
of any Tax Claim relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that ends on or prior
to the Closing Date, if Seller has conclusively established in writing its
obligation to indemnify the Target Companies, Buyer and their Affiliates with
respect to such Tax Claim and all Losses related thereto and at all times
conducts the defense of the Tax Claim in good faith and in a reasonably
diligent manner.

 



59 (c) _Tax Claims for Straddle Periods._ Seller will have the right to
participate jointly with Buyer in representing the interests of the Target
Companies in any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle Period, if and to the extent

the defense of any claim in such proceeding.

any deferred items required to be included in income by Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-13 and any excess loss account taken into income under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-19) on Sellers federal consolidated income Tax
Returns for all periods through the end of the Closing Date and pay any
federal income Taxes attributable to such income.

 

(e) _Right to Approve Settlement of_ _Tax Claims_ _._ Buyer or its
Affiliates may not settle, compromise or resolve any Tax Claim for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period without the consent of Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Seller may not settle,
compromise or resolve any Tax Claim that could reasonably be expected to have
an adverse effect on Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates, in any Tax
period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date without the
consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if notice is given to Seller of the
commencement of any Tax Claim relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that ends
on or before the Closing Date and Seller does not, within forty-five (45)
days after Buyers notice is given, give notice to Buyer of its election to
assume the defense thereof pursuant to Section 6.06(b), Seller shall be bound
by any determination made in such Tax Claim or any compromise or
settlement thereof effected by Buyer.

Section 6.07 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Seller and

Companies as may be required for purposes of completing IRS Form 5471 or other
similar Tax Returns to be filed by Seller. Such cooperation and information
shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof,
together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents
relating to rulings or other determinations by tax authorities. Each
of Seller and Buyer shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers,
records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of
Target Companies for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to
which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to
extensions except to the extent notified by the other party in writing of such
extensions for the respective Tax periods. Prior to transferring, destroying
or discarding any Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other
documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Target Companies
for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date, Seller or Buyer (as
the case may be) shall provide the other party with reasonable written notice
and offer the other party the opportunity to take custody of such materials.

 



60 Section 6.08 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_.
Any indemnification payments pursuant to this Article VI shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

 

Section 6.09 _Survival_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the provisions of Section 3.22 and this Article VI shall survive
for the full period of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect
to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof) plus 60 days.

responsibility pursuant to Article VIII may overlap with an obligation or

of them for, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the
Buyer Indemnitees based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties
of Seller contained in this Agreement or in any certificate, instrument or
agreement delivered to Buyer by or on behalf of Seller pursuant to this
Agreement (other than in respect of Section 3.22, it being understood that the
sole remedy for any such inaccuracy in or breach thereof shall be pursuant to
Article VI), as of the date such representation or warranty was made or as if
such representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing Date (except
for representations and warranties that expressly relate to a specified date,
the inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with reference to such
specified date);

 

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation
to be performed by Seller pursuant to this Agreement or in any certificate,
instrument or agreement delivered to Buyer by or on behalf of Seller pursuant
to this Agreement (other than any breach or violation of, or failure to fully
perform, any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation in Article VI, it
being understood that the sole remedy for any such breach, violation or

contributions or benefits accrued or are owed as of the Closing Date or that
accrue or become owed after the Closing Date with respect to such plan;

 

(d) the matters (x) described in Section 8.02(d)(x) of the Disclosure

(f) any of the Excluded Assets, including, without limitation, the
presence of any Hazardous Materials on, under or at the 5151 Gasmer Property
or the Corpus Christi Property; _provided, however,_ Seller shall have no
obligation to indemnify Buyer for any Release of

 



64  Hazardous Materials on, under or at the 5151 Gasmer Property caused by the
Companys operation during the term of the lease described in Section 5.21 of
this Agreement; _provided, further, however,_ absent gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of the Buyer or the Target Company, Buyer shall
not, for purposes of this provision, be deemed to have caused any Release of
Hazardous Materials on, under or at the 5151 Gasmer Property that results
from the continuation of operations in a manner consistent with those of the
Target Companies prior to the Closing; or

 

(g) any Seller Transaction Expenses.

 

Section 8.03 _Indemnification By Buyer_. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Article VIII, Buyer shall indemnify and defend each of
Seller and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives (collectively,
the "Seller Indemnitees") against, and shall hold each of them harmless from
and against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses
incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Seller Indemnitees based upon,
arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties
of Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any certificate, instrument or
agreement delivered to Seller by or on behalf of Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement, as of the date such representation or warranty was made or as if
such representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing Date
(except for representations and warranties that expressly relate to a
specified date, the inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with
reference to such specified date); or

 

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation
to be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement (other than Article VI,
it being understood that the sole remedy for any such breach thereof shall be
pursuant to Article VI); or

 

(c) any Liabilities arising out of the operation of the Companys business
after the Closing Date other than any Losses subject to the indemnification
under Article VI or Section 8.02.

Section 8.04 _Certain Limitations_. The indemnification provided for in
Section 8.02 and Section 8.03 shall be subject to the following limitations:

 

(a) Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnitees for indemnification
under Section 8.02(a) for any individual claim in which the Losses relating
to such claim (or series of claims arising from the same or substantially
similar facts or circumstances) are less than $50,000.

 

(b) Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnitees for indemnification
under Section 8.02(a) except to the extent that the aggregate amount of all
Losses, excluding those Losses for which Seller is not liable to the Buyer
Indemnitees by reason of the provisions of Section 8.04(a), in respect of
indemnification under Section 8.02(a) exceeds $750,000 (the "Basket"), and
then only to the extent such Losses exceed the Basket. The aggregate amount of
all Losses for which Seller shall be liable pursuant to Section 8.02(a) shall
not exceed twenty-two million and two hundred thousand dollars ($22,200,000)
(the "Cap").

 

(c) Buyer shall not be liable to the Seller Indemnitees for indemnification
under Section 8.03(a) except to the extent that the aggregate amount of all
Losses in respect of indemnification under Section 8.03(a) exceeds the Basket.
The aggregate amount of all Losses for which Buyer shall be liable pursuant to
Section 8.03(a) shall not exceed the Cap.

 



65 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in Section
8.04(b) and Section 8.04(c) shall not apply to Losses based upon, arising out
of, with respect to or by reason of (x) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty in Section 3.01, Section 3.02, Section 3.03,
Section 3.04, Section 3.19, Section 3.24, Section 4.01 and Section 4.04 or (y)
any intentional misrepresentations or fraud; _provided, however_ , (i) the
aggregate amount of Losses for which Seller shall be liable pursuant to (A)
Section 8.02(a) by reason of any inaccuracy in or breach of the representation
and warranty in Section 3.19 and (B) Section 8.02(f) relating to
environmental matters shall not exceed seventy-four million dollars
($74,000,000) and (ii) the maximum aggregate amount of Losses for which Seller
shall be liable under this Agreement shall not exceed one hundred forty-eight
million dollars ($148,000,000).

 

(e) For purposes of this Article VIII, in the event any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty shall occur, then the determination
of Loss shall be determined without regard to any qualification as to
materiality, Material Adverse Effect, Material Loss or other similar
qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation or
warranty. The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under this
Agreement shall be reduced or reimbursed, as the case may be, by (i) any third
party insurance proceeds and third party recoveries actually received by an
Indemnified Party as a direct consequence of such Losses ("Applicable
Insurance Recoveries") and (ii) cash tax savings or refunds actually received
as a direct consequence of such Losses by an Indemnified Party in the year of
such Losses or the year immediately following such Losses ("Applicable Tax
Recoveries" and, together with Applicable Insurance Recoveries, "Applicable
Recoveries"); _provided, however_ , no party shall have an obligation to seek
any such Applicable Recoveries. If an Indemnified Party receives any
Applicable Recoveries with respect to Losses that were the subject of
indemnification under this Agreement at any time subsequent to the payment of
such indemnification by the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party
shall promptly reimburse or procure such reimbursement to the Indemnifying
Party of the amount of such Applicable Recoveries.

 

(f) Buyer shall, and shall procure that each Buyer Indemnitee shall, and
Seller shall, and shall procure that each Seller Indemnitee shall, make
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or minimize Losses under this
Agreement upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable
under this Agreement; _provided_ that such Indemnified Party shall not be
required to incur extraordinary or unreasonable expense or risk to mitigate or
minimize any such Losses. If an Indemnified Party fails to so mitigate an
indemnifiable Loss under the preceding sentence, the Indemnifying Party shall
have no liability for any portion of such Loss that would reasonably be
expected to have been avoided had the Indemnified Party made such efforts.

 

Section 8.05 _Indemnification Procedures_. The party making a claim under
this Article VIII is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party
against whom such claims are asserted under this Article VIII is referred to
as the "Indemnifying Party".

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated
to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof. The
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of
such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third
Party

 



66  Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by
giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any
Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense and by the Indemnifying
Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
of any Third Party Claim, subject to Section 8.05(b), it shall have the right
to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or
make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on
behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel
selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the
defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party, _provided, that_ if in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses
available to an Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot
be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction for which
the Indemnified Party so determines counsel is required. If the Indemnifying
Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim or fails to
promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend
as provided in this Agreement, or fails to diligently prosecute the defense
of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to Section
8.05(b), pay, compromise, defend such Third Party Claim and seek
indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating
to such Third Party Claim. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in
all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party
Claim, including making available (subject to the provisions of Section 5.06)
records relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense
(other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending
party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably
necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

(b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into
settlement of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except as provided in this Section 8.05(b). If a firm offer is made
to settle a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of
a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of
each Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection
with such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and
agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that
effect to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to
such firm offer within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the
Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and
in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such
Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the
Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the
Third Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant
to Section 8.05(a), it shall not agree to any settlement without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



67 (c) _Direct Claims_. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a
Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall
be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice
shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by
the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of such notice to respond in
writing to such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what
extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the
Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to the premises and
personnel of any of the Target Companies and the right to examine and copy any
accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its
professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does
not so respond within such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified
Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the
Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement.

 

(d) _Tax Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the control of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding in respect of Taxes
of any of the Target Companies (including, but not limited to, any such claim
in respect of a breach of the representations and warranties in Section 3.22
hereof or any breach or violation of or failure to fully perform any
covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation in Article VI) shall be
governed exclusively by Article VI hereof.

 

Section 8.06 _Payments_. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying
Party or finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article VIII, the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within fifteen (15) Business
Days of such final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. The parties hereto agree that should an
Indemnifying Party not make full payment of any such obligations within such
fifteen (15) Business Day period, any amount payable shall accrue interest
from and including the date of agreement of the Indemnifying Party or final,
non-appealable adjudication to but excluding the date such payment has been
made at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate.

 

Section 8.07 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All
indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the
parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

 

Section 8.08 _Exclusive Remedies_. Subject to Section 5.07 and Section
10.11, the parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud,
criminal activity or willful misconduct on the part of a party hereto in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement,
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in Article VI
and this Article VIII. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims
and causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement it may have against the other parties
hereto and their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives
arising under or based upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in Article VI and this Article VIII. Nothing in this
Section 8.08 shall limit any Persons right to

 



68  seek any remedy on account of any partys fraudulent, criminal or
intentional misconduct or to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any
Person shall be entitled, other than any right to seek and obtain
contribution from Seller Parties pursuant to CERCLA or other federal or state
Environmental Law or common law, any right to which Buyer expressly waives.

 

Section 8.09 _Escrow_.

 

(a) The Escrow Amount to be paid by Buyer at Closing to the Escrow Agent
pursuant to Section 2.02(c) shall be deposited in an interest bearing account
("Escrow Account") established and designated by the Escrow Agent, in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) Any payment Seller is obligated to make to any Buyer Indemnitee
pursuant to Article VI or this Article VIII, as may be finally determined
pursuant to Article VI or this Article VIII, shall be satisfied first by
release of funds to the Buyer Indemnitee from the Escrow Account by the
Escrow Agent. Seller and Buyer agree to jointly provide notice to the Escrow
Agent of any sums due and owing to any Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to Article VI
or this Article VIII promptly following final determination of the sum so due
and owing, and the amount paid by Escrow Agent shall accordingly reduce the
Escrow Amount. On the Expiration Date, the Escrow Agent shall release the
Escrow Amount (to the extent not utilized to pay Buyer Indemnitees for any
indemnification claim due or owing in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement) to Seller, except that the Escrow Agent shall retain an amount (up
to the total amount then held by the Escrow Agent in the Escrow Account)
equal to the amount of claims for indemnification under Article VI or this
Article VIII that have been asserted in writing prior to the Expiration Date
but not yet resolved ("Unresolved Claims"). The Escrow Amount retained for
Unresolved Claims shall be released by the Escrow Agent (to the extent not
utilized to pay any Buyer Indemnitees for any such claims resolved in favor of
such Buyer Indemnitees) upon their resolution in accordance with Article VI
or this Article VIII, as applicable, and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

(c) Under no circumstances shall the deposit of the Escrow Amount into the
Escrow Account or the provisions of this Section 8.09 serve to create (or
imply an agreement to create) any type of limitation on the liabilities and
obligations of Seller under this Agreement to the amount of funds held in
Escrow Account. Sellers liabilities under this Agreement shall apply
irrespective of whether such liabilities may exceed the amount of funds held
in Escrow Account as of any time.

 

Section 8.10 _Effect of Investigation_.

 

(a) Except as provided in Section 8.10(b), Seller shall not be liable under
Section 8.02(a) for any Losses based upon or arising out of any inaccuracy in
or breach of any of the representations or warranties of Seller if any of the
Buyer Designees had actual knowledge of such inaccuracy or breach prior to the
Closing;  _provided, however_ , if none of the Buyer Designees has actual
knowledge of such inaccuracy or breach prior to the Closing, Buyers right to
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.02(a) with respect thereto shall not be
affected or deemed waived by reason of any Representative of Buyer, other
than the Buyer Designees, having actual knowledge of such inaccuracy or breach
prior to the Closing.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.10(a), the representations
and warranties of Seller in Section 3.01, Section 3.02, Section 3.03, Section
3.04, Section 3.19, Section 3.22 and Section 3.24, and Buyers right to
indemnification pursuant to Section 6.03(a)  

 



69  or Section 8.02(a), as applicable, with respect thereto, shall not be
affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf
of Buyer (including by any of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact
that Buyer or any of its Representatives (including the Buyer Designees) knew
or should have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or might
be inaccurate or by reason of Buyers waiver of any condition set forth in
Section 7.03.

Section 8.11 _Disclaimer of Application of Anti-Indemnity Statutes_. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions of any anti-indemnity
statute relating to oilfield services and associated activities are not
applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 8.12 _Waivers and Disclaimers_.

 



     | (a) | EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE. THE INDEMNIFICATION AND WAIVER
PROVISIONS IN THIS ARTICLE VIII SHALL BE ENFORCEABLE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING THE
PERSON FROM WHOM INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT) ALLEGES OR PROVES THE SOLE,
CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY, OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PERSON SEEKING
INDEMNIFICATION OR THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON THE
PERSON SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT BY SUCH PERSON. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STATEMENT
COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS CONSPICUOUS.

     | (b) | _EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS_. BUYER HAS NOT RELIED UPON ANY
REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, STATEMENT, ADVICE, DOCUMENT, PROJECTION, OR OTHER
INFORMATION OF ANY TYPE PROVIDED BY ANY OF THE SELLER PARTIES OR ANY OF THEIR
RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

AGREEMENT, AND TO CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTION, BUYER HAS RELIED AND WILL RELY
SOLELY UPON ITS OWN KNOWLEDGE, INVESTIGATION, AND ANALYSIS (AND THAT OF ITS
AFFILIATES AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES) AND NOT ON ANY DISCLOSURE OR
REPRESENTATION MADE BY, OR ANY DUTY TO DISCLOSE ON THE PART OF, ANY OF THE
SELLER PARTIES OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES, OTHER THAN THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | _LIMITED DUTIES_. ANY AND ALL DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS WHICH
A PARTY MAY HAVE TO THE OTHER PARTY WITH RESPECT TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
ASSETS, THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTION ARE LIMITED TO THOSE IN THIS
AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES DO NOT INTEND THAT THE DUTIES OR OBLIGATIONS OF ANY
PARTY, OR THE RIGHTS OF ANY PARTY, WILL BE EXPANDED BEYOND THE TERMS OF THIS
AGREEMENT ON THE BASIS OF ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE PRINCIPLE OR ON ANY OTHER
BASIS WHATSOEVER. 
---|---|--- 
 



70 EXPRESSLY REPRESENTED BY SELLER OTHERWISE IN ARTICLE III, AND WITHOUT LIMITING
THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS
ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO
THE ASSETS OR OPERATIONS OF THE TARGET COMPANIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, (I) ANY IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, (II) ANY
IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, (III) ANY
IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTY OF CONFORMITY TO MODELS OR SAMPLES OF MATERIALS,
AND (IV) ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES EXISTING UNDER APPLICABLE LAW NOW OR
HEREAFTER IN EFFECT.

Section 8.13 _No Duplication of Remedies_. In no event shall either Seller
or Buyer be entitled to duplicate compensation with respect to any claims or
any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement herein
asserted under the terms of this Agreement, even though such claim or breach
may be addressed by more than one provision of this Agreement.

Section 10.03 _Interpretation_. For purposes of this Agreement, (a)
the words "include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation"; (b) the word "or" is not
exclusive; and (c) the words "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto" and
"hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole. Unless the context otherwise
requires, references herein: (x) to Articles, Sections, Disclosure Schedules
and Exhibits mean the Articles and Sections of, and Disclosure Schedules and
Exhibits attached to, this Agreement; (y) to an agreement, instrument or other
document means such agreement, instrument or other document as amended,
supplemented and modified from time to time to the extent permitted by the
provisions thereof and (z) to a statute means such statute as amended from
time to time and includes any successor legislation thereto and any
regulations promulgated thereunder. This Agreement shall be construed without
regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation
against the party drafting an instrument or causing any instrument to be
drafted. The Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits referred to herein shall be
construed with, and as an integral part of, this Agreement to the same extent
as if they were set forth verbatim herein.

Section 10.04 _Headings_. The headings in this Agreement are for
reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.05 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in
any other jurisdiction. Except as provided in Section 5.07(e), upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible.

 

Section 10.06 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the
Schedules and Exhibits) and the other Transaction Documents constitute the
sole and entire agreement of the parties to this Agreement with respect to the
subject matter contained herein and therein, and supersede all prior and

 



73  contemporaneous representations, warranties, understandings and agreements,
both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. In the event of
any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this Agreement and
those in the other Transaction Documents, the Exhibits and Disclosure
Schedules (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the
Disclosure Schedules), the statements in the body of this Agreement
will control.

Section 10.07 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign its
rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
_provided, however_ , that prior to the Closing Date, Buyer may, without the
prior written consent of Seller, assign all or any portion of its rights under
this Agreement to one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries. No assignment
shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any
attempted assignment or other transfer by a party of this Agreement in whole
or in part, or assignment or other transfer by a party of any rights under
this Agreement, or delegation or other transfer by a party of any obligations
or duties under this Agreement, not in accordance with this Section 10.07
shall be deemed void and of no effect.

 

Section 10.08 _No Third-party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in
Section 6.03 and Article VIII, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and
nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 10.09 _Amendment and Modification; Waiver_. This Agreement may
only be amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by
each party hereto. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof
shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the
party so waiving. No waiver by any party shall operate or be construed as a
waiver in respect of any failure, breach or default not expressly identified
by such written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and
whether occurring before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or
delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this
Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege.

 

Section 10.10 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the internal laws of the State of Texas without giving effect to any choice
or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Texas or any
other jurisdiction).

 

(b) ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS
AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY MAY BE INSTITUTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA OR THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS IN EACH CASE LOCATED IN THE
CITY OF HOUSTON AND COUNTY OF HARRIS, AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO
THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR OTHER DOCUMENT BY MAIL TO
SUCH PARTYS ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS
FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT. THE
PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY

 



74  WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR ANY
PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR
CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN
ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.10(c).

 

Section 10.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity, and the parties hereby consent
and agree to such injunctive relief, specific performance, and other equitable
remedies.

Section 10.12 _Disclosure Schedules_. Unless the context otherwise
requires, all capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules shall have
the respective meanings assigned in this Agreement. No reference to or
disclosure of any item or other matter in the Disclosure Schedules shall be
construed as an admission or indication that such item or other matter is
material or that such item or other matter is required to be referred to or
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules. No disclosure in the Disclosure
Schedules relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement or Law
shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred. The inclusion of any information
in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment by Seller, in and of itself, that such information is material
to or outside the Ordinary Course of Business or is required to be disclosed
on the Disclosure Schedules. To the extent readily apparent on the face of any
disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules that it would qualify another
representation or warranty, such disclosure shall be deemed to qualify such
other representation and warranty notwithstanding the lack of a specific
cross-reference.

Section 10.13 _Conspicuous_. The parties agree that, to the extent
required by applicable Law to be effective or enforceable, the provisions of
this Agreement contained in Sections 8.12 and 10.10 and elsewhere in bold-
type font are "conspicuous" for the purpose of any applicable Law.

Section 10.14 _Waivers_. Any failure by a party to comply with any of its
obligations, agreements or conditions herein contained may be waived by the
party or parties to whom such compliance is owed by an instrument signed by
such party or parties and expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any
other manner. No waiver of, or consent to a change in, any of the provisions
of this

 



75  Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of, or consent to a
change in, other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such
waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.

Section 10.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed
in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall be deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of
this Agreement delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic
transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an
original signed copy of this Agreement.
