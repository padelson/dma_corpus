Parent (&#147;MERGER SUB&#148;), uDate.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;COMPANY&#148;),
and, for purposes of Section&nbsp;7.8 and Articles X and XI hereof, Terrence Lee

Agreement, Parent has required, among other things, that Zehrer and Trustee
(together, the &#147;MAJOR STOCKHOLDERS&#148;) agree to give Parent an irrevocable proxy
to vote their shares in favor of the Merger (as defined below) and, in order to
induce Parent to enter into this Agreement, such stockholders have so agreed
with Parent in a separate written agreement entered into on the date hereof
(the &#147;STOCKHOLDERS&#146; AGREEMENT&#148;);
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the parties intend that the Merger will constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section&nbsp;368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;CODE&#148;), and that this Agreement will constitute
a plan of reorganization.

hereby, the parties agree as follows:
