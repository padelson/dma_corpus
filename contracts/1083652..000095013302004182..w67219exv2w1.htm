AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER  

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 19, 2002 (this "AGREEMENT), among USA Interactive, a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), Geffen Acquisition Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"), uDate.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), and, for purposes of Section 7.8 and Articles X and XI hereof, Terrence Lee Zehrer, an individual ("ZEHRER") and Atlas Trust Company (Jersey) Limited (the "TRUSTEE"), as trustee of the Internet Investments Inc. Employee Shares Trust.  

W I T N E S S E T H  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have declared the advisability of this Agreement and approved the strategic business combination transaction provided for herein in which Merger Sub will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving such merger as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Parent; and  

 WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, Parent has required, among other things, that Zehrer and Trustee (together, the "MAJOR STOCKHOLDERS") agree to give Parent an irrevocable proxy to vote their shares in favor of the Merger (as defined below) and, in order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement, such stockholders have so agreed with Parent in a separate written agreement entered into on the date hereof (the "STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT");  

 WHEREAS, the parties intend that the Merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), and that this Agreement will constitute a plan of reorganization.  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:  

ARTICLE I  

THE MERGER  

 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined below), Merger Sub shall be merged (the "MERGER") with and into the Company in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION").   ##### 

 

 1.2 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger, the Company and Merger Sub shall file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or, if agreed by the parties hereto, at such later date or time as is specified in the certificate of merger (the "EFFECTIVE TIME").  

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises and be subject to all of the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL.  

ARTICLE II  

CONVERSION OF SHARES  

 2.1 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time:  

 (a) each share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (each a "SHARE" and collectively the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto;  

 (b) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub ("MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("SURVIVING CORPORATION COMMON STOCK"), of the Surviving Corporation; and  

 (c) each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.2(c)_ with respect to fractional shares and _Section 2.3_ with respect to Shares as to which appraisal rights have been exercised, be converted into the right to receive 0.18956 shares of Parent Common Stock (as defined in _Section 5.2_) (the "SHARE EXCHANGE RATIO"), upon surrender of the certificate representing such Share in the manner provided in  _Section 2.2_. The Share Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in  ##### 

   

respect of the Shares, together with the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in respect of In-The-Money Options (as defined in S _ection
2.4(a)_), are referred to as the "MERGER CONSIDERATION."  

 2.2 _Surrender and Payment_.  

 (a) Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement (as defined in _Section 4.4_ ), Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") for the purpose of exchanging certificates representing Shares for, and distributing to holders of In-The-Money Options and the Warrant, the Merger Consideration. Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, make available to the Exchange Agent, as soon as reasonably practicable as of or after the Effective Time, (i) except as set forth in the next sentence of this _Section 2.2(a)_, certificates representing the Merger Consideration issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ in exchange for outstanding Shares, pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_ in exchange for In-The-Money Options and pursuant to  _Section 2.4(b)_ in exchange for the Warrant, (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to make payments for fractional shares required pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and (iii) any dividends or distributions to which holders of certificates may be entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_, which funds shall not be used by the Exchange Agent for any other purpose. Notwithstanding the second sentence of this _Section 2.2(a)_, (x) the certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock comprising the Escrow Amount (as defined in _Section 2.5_) shall not be deposited with the Exchange Agent but shall instead be deposited with the Escrow Agent (as defined in _Section 2.5_) and (y) the shares of Parent Common Stock comprising the Option Tax Shares (as defined in _Section 2.6(b)_ shall not be deposited with the Exchange Agent but shall be deposited with the Designated Broker (as defined in _Section 2.6(b)_). For purposes of determining the aggregate Merger Consideration to be made available to the Exchange Agent, Parent shall assume that no holder of Shares will perfect appraisal rights with respect to such Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time a letter of transmittal for use in such exchange (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the certificates representing Shares to the Exchange Agent).  

 (b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into a right to receive Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a certificate or certificates formerly representing such Shares, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal covering such Shares, will be entitled to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Shares. Until so surrendered and except as otherwise set forth in _Section 2.3_, each such certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes, only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or will accrue on such Merger Consideration.  

 (c) No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of certificates formerly representing Shares, or in exchange for In-The-Money Options or upon conversion of the Warrant (as defined below), and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other  ##### 

   

provision of this Agreement, each holder of (i) Shares who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement (after taking into account all certificates
formerly representing Shares delivered by such holder and the aggregate
number of Shares represented thereby), (ii) In-The-Money Options who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement (after aggregating the number
of Shares issuable upon exercise of all In-The-Money Options held by such
holder) or (iii) the Warrant, if such holder would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement (after aggregating the number of Shares issuable upon exercise
of the Warrant) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an
amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock
multiplied by the closing price of the Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ
National Market ("NASDAQ") (or, if the Parent Common Stock shall have been
approved for listing on another national stock exchange prior to such time,
such exchange) on the Closing Date, rounded down to the nearest whole
cent.  

 (d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate formerly representing Shares and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ until the holder of record of such certificate shall surrender such certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such certificate, there shall be issued and paid to the record holder of the certificate (i) at the time of surrender (A) certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor and (B) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, without interest and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions having a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender that are payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.  

 (e) If any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable with respect to a certificate or certificates formerly representing Shares is to be paid to a Person (as defined below) other than the registered holder of such certificate or certificates, it shall be a condition to such payment that the certificate or certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Shares or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. For purposes of this Agreement, "PERSON" means an individual, a corporation, a limited liability company, a partnership, an association, a trust or any other entity or organization, including a government or political subdivision or any agency or instrumentality thereof.   ##### 

 

 (f) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, certificates formerly representing Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article II.  

 (g) Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ that, 12 months after the Effective Time, remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his Shares for Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.2_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of Merger Consideration in respect of his Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Parent shall not be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to applicable escheat or similar abandoned property laws.  

 (h) Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ in respect of Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.  

 (i) In the event that any certificate evidencing Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange therefor, upon making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the aggregate Merger Consideration due in respect of such Shares that is payable pursuant to this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the delivery of a suitable bond or indemnity agreement by the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate.  

 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.1_, Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a holder who has not voted such Shares in favor of the Merger, who shall have delivered a written demand for appraisal of such Shares in the manner provided by the DGCL and who, as of the Effective Time, shall otherwise have properly exercised and perfected and not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL ("DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted into a right to receive Merger Consideration. The holders thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the DGCL;  _provided, however,_ that (i) if any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have failed to establish his entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, (ii) if any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have effectively withdrawn his demand for appraisal of such Shares or lost his right to appraisal and payment for his Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL or (iii) if neither any holder of Dissenting Shares nor the Surviving Corporation shall have filed a petition demanding a determination of the value of all Dissenting Shares within the time provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such Shares and each such Share shall be treated as if  ##### 

   

it had been converted, as of the Effective Time, into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, as provided in _Section 2.1_
hereof. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands.  

 2.4 _Stock Options and Warrants_.  

 (a) In accordance with the terms of the Companys 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2000 PLAN") and the Companys 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2001 PLAN" and, together with the 2000 Plan, the "COMPANY STOCK PLANS") and the related option agreements, each outstanding stock option (each, an "OPTION") granted under the Company Stock Plans with an exercise price equal to or less than $4.66 (the "IN-THE-MONEY OPTIONS") shall accelerate and be exercisable in full immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each holder of an In-The-Money Option that has not been exercised prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive, in respect of each Share subject to all In-The-Money Options then held by such holder, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the remainder of (i) (A) the Share Exchange Ratio multiplied by (B) the aggregate number of Shares underlying all In-The-Money Options held by such holder minus (ii) (x) the aggregate exercise price of all of such holders In-The-Money Options divided by (y) $24.60 (the "SIGNING PRICE"). Immediately upon the conversion of the In-The-Money Options into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 2.4(a)_, the In-The-Money Options shall terminate. The Options that are not In-The-Money Options (the "UNDERWATER OPTIONS") shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time, in the case of Options outstanding under the 2001 Plan, and at the Effective Time, in the case of Options outstanding under the 2000 Plan. No Options shall be exercisable at any time after the Effective Time. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issuable in respect of any Shares subject to In-The-Money Options. To the extent any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock would otherwise be issuable pursuant to this  _Section 2.4(a)_, in lieu thereof, the holder of such In-The-Money Options shall receive cash in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_.  

 (b) At the Effective Time, the holder of the Warrant shall be entitled to receive, in respect of each Share subject to the Warrant (as defined below), a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the remainder of (i) (A) the Share Exchange Ratio multiplied by (B) the aggregate number of Shares underlying the Warrant minus (ii) (x) the aggregate exercise price of the Warrant divided by (y) the Signing Price. Immediately upon the conversion of the Warrant into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)_, the Warrant shall terminate. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issuable in respect of any Shares subject to the Warrant. To the extent any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock would otherwise be issuable pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)_, in lieu thereof, the holder of the Warrant shall receive cash in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_. Prior to or as of the date hereof, the holder of the Warrant has agreed with the Company in writing to the  ##### 

   

effect of the Merger on the Warrant as described in this _Section 2.4(b)_.
For purposes hereof, "WARRANT" shall mean the Stock Purchase Warrant dated
November 9, 2000 issued by the Company to Morrison and Foerster LLP.  

 2.5 _Escrow Amount_. At the Closing, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the sum of (a) 0.20 multiplied by the total number of shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise payable to Zehrer as Merger Consideration under this Agreement (such product being the "ZEHRER ESCROW SHARES") and (b) 0.20 multiplied by the total number of shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise payable to Trustee as Merger Consideration under this Agreement (such product being the "ATLAS ESCROW SHARES" and the sum of the Zehrer Escrow Shares and the Atlas Escrow Shares being the "ESCROWED SHARES"), rounded down to the nearest whole share, shall be deposited in escrow (the "ESCROW") to be held by the escrow agent (the "ESCROW AGENT") under the Escrow Agreement in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (the "ESCROW AGREEMENT") to be held pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding any amendment to this Agreement that increases the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares as a result of an offer made by Parent pursuant to  _Section 9.1(g)_, the Escrowed Shares shall be calculated on the basis of the Merger Consideration as defined in this Agreement on the date hereof.  

 2.6 _Withholding Rights_.  

 (a) The Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement such amount as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law and shall pay over such withheld amounts to the proper federal, state, local or foreign taxing authority. If the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect of which the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.  

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in order to satisfy the "employee portion" (the "PAYE") of the tax and withholding obligations under the tax laws of the United Kingdom relating to the issuance of Merger Consideration in exchange for the In-The-Money Options held by the employees of the Company and Company Subsidiaries that are U.K. taxpayers, as identified on Schedule E hereto (the "UK OPTIONHOLDERS"), the Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, nominate a broker-dealer (the "DESIGNATED BROKER") who shall, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, sell on behalf of the UK Optionholders a number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock having a Market Value (as defined below) as of the day such shares are sold equal to the aggregate PAYE that shall be due as a result of the exchange of Merger Consideration for all In-The-Money Options held by the UK Optionholders; _provided, however,_ that if there is no number of shares of Parent  ##### 

   

Common Stock that will have a value exactly equal to the aggregate PAYE, the
number of shares to be sold by the Designated Broker shall be rounded up
to the next whole share. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be sold by
the Designated Broker pursuant to this _Section 2.6(b)_ are referred to as
the "OPTION TAX SHARES." For purposes hereof, the "MARKET VALUE" shall mean
the average of the weighted average of the trading prices of the Parent
Common Stock on the NASDAQ or New York Stock Exchange, as applicable, for
each of the days in the five-day trading period ending on the day on which
the Market Value is being determined. Promptly following the sale of the
Option Tax Shares, (i) the Designated Broker shall remit to the Surviving
Corporation the sale proceeds equal to the aggregate PAYE and (ii) if the
sale proceeds exceed the aggregate PAYE, the Designated Broker shall remit to
each UK Optionholder such UK Optionholders portion of the excess sale
proceeds. The Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to, comply with all applicable laws related to the payment and
reporting of the PAYE due from each UK Optionholder. The commissions of the
Designated Broker shall be paid by the UK Optionholders.  

ARTICLE III

 3.1 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended in the Merger to read in its entirety as set forth on Exhibit B hereto and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, subject to _Section 7.5(b)_, until amended in accordance with applicable law.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect (i) the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries (as defined below) to conduct their respective businesses as they are currently conducted or as currently contemplated by them to be conducted. As used in this Agreement, the word "SUBSIDIARY," when used with respect to any party, means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated with such party for financial reporting purposes. True and complete copies of the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws, including any and all amendments thereto (the "COMPANY CERTIFICATE" and the "COMPANY BY-LAWS," respectively), have previously been made available by the Company to Parent and are accurate and complete as of the date hereof.  

 (b) The Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of all of the Companys Subsidiaries (each, a "COMPANY SUBSIDIARY"). Each Company Subsidiary: (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization; (ii) is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified, except for any failure to be so qualified that would not reasonably be expected to be material; and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.  

 4.2 _Capitalization_.

All of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof.

As of December 18, 2002, the Company had outstanding stock options providing for the  ##### 

   

issuance of 6,790,500 shares of Company Common Stock, of which 5,590,500 are

does not have and is not bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the
purchase or issuance of any shares of Company Capital Stock or any other
equity securities of the Company or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of Company Capital Stock. There are
no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness or
other securities of the Company having the right to vote (or, except for the
Company Notes, convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for,
securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of
the Company may vote. There are no voting, sale, transfer or other similar
agreements to which the Company is a party with respect to the Company
Capital Stock or any other securities of the Company that are convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of the Company Capital Stock.
The Company has not violated any applicable securities laws in connection
with the offer, sale or issuance of any securities of the Company. The
"COMPANY NOTES" shall mean those certain promissory notes, in the original
aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million, dated March 29, 2001, issued in
connection with the Companys acquisition of Kiss.com, Inc., true and correct
copies of which have been delivered to Parent.  

 (b) The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity ownership interests of each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any and all liens, claims, pledges, charges, encumbrances, deeds of trust, security interests and other rights of third parties, whether voluntarily incurred or arising by operation of law ("LIENS"), and all of such shares and equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Company Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such Company Subsidiary. There are no voting, sale, transfer or other similar agreements to which any Company Subsidiary is a party with respect to its capital stock or any other securities of it that are convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of the capital stock of any Company Subsidiary. The Company has no material investments in corporations, joint ventures, partnerships, limited liability companies and other entities other than the Company Subsidiaries.   #####

This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer and conveyance, moratorium, reorganization, receivership and similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of the rights and remedies of creditors generally and (ii) principles of equity (regardless of whether considered and applied in a proceeding in equity or at law).  

 (b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) violate any provision of the Company Certificate or the Company By-Laws or any provision of any comparable organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or (ii) assuming that the consents and approvals referred to in  _Section 4.4_ are duly obtained, (x) violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction applicable to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets or (y) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of any provision of or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except (in the case of clause (ii) above) for any such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults which, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material.   ##### 

 

 4.4 _Consents and Approvals_.

 4.5 _SEC Reports and Financial Statements_.  

 (a) Since June 9, 2000, the Company and its Subsidiaries have filed with the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, registration statements and definitive proxy statements required to be filed by them with the SEC (as amended since the time of their filing and prior to the date hereof, collectively, the "COMPANY SEC REPORTS") and has heretofore made available to Parent complete and correct copies of all Company SEC Reports. As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder (the "EXCHANGE ACT"), or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder (the "SECURITIES ACT") applicable, as the case may be, to such Company SEC Reports, and none of the Company SEC Reports contained, at the time they were filed or became effective, as the case may be, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  

 (b) The consolidated financial statements (including any related notes) included in the Company SEC Reports (collectively, the "COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS") fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results of the consolidated operations and changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth; and each of such Company Financial Statements (including the related notes, where applicable) complies, in all material respects, with  #####

 (c) The Company and Parent shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement and the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   ##### 

 

 (d) The Company and Parent shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any approval of such Governmental Entity will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.

 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the other party reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of U.S. federal or securities laws and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request. Neither the Company nor Parent nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide such access or to disclose such information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of the Companys or Parents, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date hereof. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

Subject to _Section 7.8(d)_, the Companys Board of Directors shall recommend the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders (which recommendation shall be included in the Proxy Statement) and shall use its reasonable  ##### 

   

best efforts to cause the Company Stockholder Approval to be obtained. The

Thereafter, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide benefits no less favorable in the aggregate than the benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize the prior service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary of each employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the Effective Time (the "COMPANY EMPLOYEES") in connection with all Parent employee benefit plans in which such Company Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and levels of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan). From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) use its reasonable best efforts to cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent to be waived with respect to the Company Employees and their eligible dependents to the extent such limitations or waiting periods would be waived under the applicable Company Benefits Plan and (ii) give each Company Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time.  

 (b) The foregoing notwithstanding, as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation agrees to honor in accordance with their terms all benefits vested as of the Effective Time under the Company Benefit Plans and all other contractual commitments of the Company to its current and former employees,  _provided_ that such Company Benefit Plans and contractual commitments are maintained and administered after December 17, 2002 not in violation of _Section 6.2_ of this Agreement.  

 (c) Nothing in this _Section 7.4_ shall be interpreted as preventing the Surviving Corporation or Parent from amending, modifying or terminating any Company Benefit Plans or other contracts, arrangements, commitments or understandings, in accordance with their terms and applicable law, except that the Surviving Corporation shall in any event comply with its obligations set forth in this _Section 7.4_.   #####

 (b) Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the Company Certificate and Company By-Laws;  _provided, however,_ that following the second anniversary of the Closing Date, nothing in this _Section 7.5(b)_ shall require Parent to cause the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions more favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are set forth in the Parent certificate of incorporation and by-laws.  

 (c) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns thereof assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.5_.

assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis,

 (b) The Company shall advise Parent orally and in writing within 24 hours of (i) any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or which could reasonably be expected to lead to any expression of interest regarding a potential Takeover Proposal that is received by or communicated to any officer or director of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries, either of the Major Stockholders, the Companys financial advisor, or any other representative of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries and/or the Major Stockholders, (ii) the material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (iii) the identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry.

 (a) by mutual consent of the Company and Parent in a written instrument;  

 (b) by either the Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of Directors of Parent if any Restraint having any of the effects set forth in  _Section 8.1(d)_  ##### 

   

shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_
that such terminating party shall have used its reasonable best efforts to
prevent the entry of and to remove such Restraint;  

 (c) by either the Companys Board of Directors or the Parents Board of Directors if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before June 19, 2003, unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; _provided, however,_ that if on such date each of the conditions set forth in Article VIII other than _Sections 8.1(b)_ or _8.1(c)_ has been fulfilled or is capable of being fulfilled, then such date shall be automatically extended to September 19, 2003;  

 (d) by either the Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of Directors of Parent (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, or the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, which breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2_ or  _8.3_ , as the case may be, and that is not cured within 30 days following written notice to the party committing such breach or by its nature or timing cannot be cured prior to the Closing Date;  

 (e) by Parent if, since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or there shall have occurred any event or circumstance that, in combination with any other events or circumstances, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company;  

 (f) by Parent, (i) if the Board of Directors of the Company withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger in a manner adverse to Parent or shall have resolved to do so or (ii) a tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock is announced or commenced and either (A) the Board of Directors of the Company recommends acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its stockholders or (B) within ten business days of such commencement, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have failed to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its stockholders;  

 (g) by the Board of Directors of the Company to accept a Superior Proposal, but only if (i) the Company promptly notifies Parent in writing of its intention to do so (which notice shall contain all material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal) and causes its legal counsel and its financial advisor to afford Parent the opportunity to match the terms of the Superior Proposal and to negotiate with Parent to make other adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement that would permit the Companys Board of Directors to recommend this Agreement, as revised and (ii) the Company has not received from Parent, within three business days of Parents receipt of  ##### 

   

the notice referred to in clause (i) of this _Section 9.1(g)_, an offer that
the Companys Board of Directors determines, in good faith, after
consultation with and taking into account the advice of its outside legal
counsel and outside financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation,
matches or exceeds such Superior Proposal or is otherwise sufficient to
permit the Board of Directors to continue to recommend this Agreement, as
amended by such offer from Parent, and the Merger, rather than the Superior
Proposal (for purposes of such determination, if the consideration offered in
a Superior Proposal is other than cash, Parent shall be deemed to have
"matched" such Superior Proposal if the aggregate consideration offered by
Parent has a value that is not less than the value of the consideration
offered in the Superior Proposal, as determined in good faith by
the Companys Board of Directors, after consultation with and taking into
account the advice of its outside legal counsel and outside financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation); Parents right to match any
Superior Proposal shall apply equally with respect to any subsequent increase
or other revision of the terms of any Superior Proposal; or  

 (h) by the Company if the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith that such termination is necessary in order for the Company or the Companys Board of Directors to comply with any applicable court order.  

 9.2 _Effect of Termination_.  

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of the Company, Parent, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) _Sections 7.2(b)_, _9.2_ , _11.2_ ,  _11.7_ and _11.10_ through and including _11.12_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement, (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no party to this Agreement shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful breach of any provision of this Agreement and (iii) no party to this Agreement shall be deemed to have waived any rights, claims, causes of action or remedies arising from fraud, intentional misrepresentation or active concealment.  

 (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_ or _9.1(g)_ , the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to $4,500,000 (the "TERMINATION FEE"). The Termination Fee shall be paid to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent and shall be paid (i) prior (and as a condition precedent) to the termination of this Agreement, in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_ or (ii) within two days of the termination of this Agreement, in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 9.1(f_). Each of the Company and Parent agrees that the Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(f_) or _9.1(g)_ ;  _provided, however,_ that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for the willful breach of any of its representations and warranties or the breach of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if a Termination Fee becomes payable by the Company  ##### 

   

pursuant to this _Section 9.2(b)_, then the Company shall also be liable for
all fees and expenses of Parent and Merger Sub incurred in connection with or
incident to the negotiation of this Agreement, including, without limitation,
legal and accounting fees, consulting fees and disbursements relating to any
of the foregoing; _provided, however,_ that the Companys liability for fees
and expenses incurred by Parent and Merger Sub shall not exceed
$1,000,000.  

 9.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained; _provided, however,_ that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there may not be, without further approval of the Companys stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement that under applicable law requires the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.  

ARTICLE X

 10.1 _Survival_.  

 (a) Except as provided in _Section 10.1(b)_, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and expire on the day that is the two year anniversary of the Closing Date, except for any covenants and agreements which by their terms are to be performed after the Closing, which shall survive and not expire unless otherwise provided in this Agreement.  

 (b) Notwithstanding _Section 10.1(a)_, each of the following representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company shall survive the Closing Date and expire on the day that is the six year anniversary of the Closing Date: (i) the inaccuracy or misrepresentation in or breach of any representation or warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company in this Agreement arising out of fraud or willful misconduct by or on behalf of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, or other agents or representatives and (ii) any inaccuracy or misrepresentations in or breach of any representation or warranty made in _Section 4.2_, _4.3_ , _4.5_ , _4.6_ , _4.9_ or _4.13_ , regardless of whether such inaccuracy or misrepresentation arises out of fraud or willful misconduct by or on behalf of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, or other agents or representatives.  

 (c) Any claim for indemnification under this Agreement must be asserted in accordance with _Section 10.2(d)_ within the applicable survival period contemplated by this _Section 10.1_ and, if properly asserted within such period, the survival period for the applicable representation and warranty shall continue until the  ##### 

   

claim is fully resolved. After the Closing has occurred, any claim related to
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained
in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement
may be brought only against the Major Stockholders pursuant to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Article X and may not be brought against the
Company or any of its stockholders other than the Major Stockholders.  

 10.2 _Indemnification_.  

 (a) From and after the Closing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers, directors, employees and Affiliates (the "INDEMNITEES") shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Major Stockholders from any damage, claim, loss, cost, liability or expense, including, without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of investigation, response action, removal action or remedial action (collectively "DAMAGES"), incurred by such Indemnitees that arise out of or relate to: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Schedule) or in any certificate delivered on the Closing Date by the Company pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) any breach by the Company of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or (iii) any liability arising out of the matters set forth in  _Section 10.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The liability of each of the Major Stockholders to the Indemnitees hereunder shall be several and not joint.  

 (b) (i) Except as provided in _Section 10.2(b)(ii)_, no Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any Damages pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages incurred by the Indemnitees exceeds $3,000,000 (the "THRESHOLD AMOUNT"), after which (subject to _Section 10.1(c)_ ) such Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for all such Damages as well as any Damages in excess of the Threshold Amount.  

 (ii) Notwithstanding _Section 10.2(b)(i)_:  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (1) any claim by an Indemnitee for indemnification of
any Pre-Closing Claims shall not be subject to the Threshold Amount;  
      
     | (2) each Major Stockholders maximum liability (the
"MAXIMUM LIABILITY") hereunder shall be equal to the product of: (A) from
the Closing Date until the one year anniversary of the Closing Date,
0.75 multiplied by the Merger Proceeds (as defined below); (B) from the
one year anniversary of the Closing Date until the two year anniversary
of the Closing Date, 0.60 multiplied by the Merger Proceeds; (C) from
the two year anniversary of the Closing Date until the three year
anniversary of the Closing Date, 0.40 multiplied by the Merger Proceeds; and
(D) from the three year anniversary of the Closing Date until the six
year anniversary of the Closing Date, 0.30 multiplied by the Merger
Proceeds;  _provided, however,_ that if, at any time, any payment made by
Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement exceeds the difference of the
aggregate value of the assets of the Trust (as defined below) at such time
(which,  ##### 

   

      |   
---|--- 
     | in the case of any assets that are not cash, shall be determined by
the readily realizable value of such assets), minus the Trustees
Maximum Liability as of such date, then the Trustees Maximum Liability shall
be reduced to an amount equal to the aggregate value of all of the
assets then held in the Trust, minus the amount of such payment; _however_ ,
in the event that the aggregate value of the assets held in the
Trust (which, in the case of any assets that are not cash, shall be
determined by the readily realizable value of such assets) shall increase
subsequent to any such reduction in the Trustees Maximum Liability, the
Trustees Maximum Liability shall increase on a dollar-for-dollar basis (up
to the Trustees Maximum Liability); and  
      
     | (3) with respect to any claim for Damages by an Indemnitee,
each Major Stockholder shall only be liable or otherwise responsible for
such Major Stockholders Pro Rata Portion (as defined below) of such
Damages.  
   

 (iii) For purposes hereof, a Major Stockholders "MERGER PROCEEDS" shall mean (x) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such Major Stockholder pursuant to _Section 2.1_, including, with respect to Zehrer, the Zehrer Escrow Shares, and, with respect to the Trustee, the Atlas Escrow Shares (as of the date hereof and notwithstanding any amendment to this Agreement that increases the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares as a result of an offer made by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_) and issued upon consummation of the Merger (such aggregate number of shares being such Major Stockholders "SIGNING SHARES"), multiplied by (y) the average of the closing price of the Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ (or, if the Parent Common Stock has been approved for listing on another national stock exchange prior to such time, such other exchange) for the five day trading period starting on the day that is the 91st day after the Closing Date (the "MEASUREMENT PRICE"), unless such Major Stockholder has sold any of its Signing Shares during such five day trading period, in which case such Major Stockholders Merger Proceeds shall equal the sum of (i) the number of Signing Shares held by such Major Stockholder at the end of such five day trading period, multiplied by the Measurement Price plus (ii) the sale proceeds to such Major Stockholder from the Signing Shares sold by it during such five day trading period. Each Major Stockholder agrees to deliver to Parent documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent to enable Parent to determine the amount of sales proceeds received by such Major Stockholder.  

 (iv) For purposes hereof, a Major Stockholders "PRO RATA PORTION" shall mean the quotient of (A) the number of Shares held by such Major Stockholder as of the date of this Agreement, divided by (B) the sum of all Shares outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, plus the aggregate number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant pursuant to Section 2.4(b) and all In-The-Money Options pursuant to Section 2.4(a). Each Major Stockholders Pro Rata Portion is set forth on Schedule F to this Agreement.  

 (c) Except as provided in the next sentence of this _Section 10.2(c)_, the Escrow Amount shall serve as the sole and exclusive source of payment and remedy to  ##### 

   

satisfy any claim for Damages for which any Indemnitee is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, claims arising out of any matter described in clause (i) or (ii)
of _Section 10.1(b)_ shall not be limited to the Escrow Amount and, in
accordance with  _Section 10.2(d)_, the Indemnitees may seek recovery
therefor up to each Major Stockholders Maximum Liability as of the date of
the applicable claim.  

 (d) Until the earlier to occur of (x) the disbursement in full of the Escrow Amount (as defined below) and (y) the termination of the Escrow Agreement pursuant to its terms, all claims for Damages by an Indemnitee shall to the fullest extent permitted by law be made against the Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement. After the earlier to occur of the events referred to in clauses (x) and (y) of this _Section 10.2(d)_, any Indemnitee seeking indemnification for Damages arising out of any matter described in clause (i) or (ii) of _Section 10.1(b)_ shall give prompt written notice thereof, within the relevant limitation period provided for in _Section 10.1(b)_, to the Major Stockholders describing in reasonable detail the basis for such claim for indemnification and shall include (if then known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of Damages that are the subject of such claim; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnitees failure to give prompt or proper notice shall not limit the Indemnitees right to indemnification, except to the extent that such failure has prejudiced the Major Stockholders right to assert any reasonable defense to such claim. The Major Stockholders shall, within 30 days of receipt of such notice, either pay to the Indemnitee their respective Pro Rata Portions of the amount of Damages set forth in such notice or respond in writing specifying any dispute with such claim for Damages. The failure of the Major Stockholders to respond within such 30 day period shall be deemed an irrevocable acceptance of liability for their respective Pro Rata Portions of the Damages set forth in such notice. For purposes hereof, the "ESCROW AMOUNT" shall mean the Escrowed Shares and any monies paid into the Escrow as a result of the disposition of Escrowed Shares pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement.  

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent agrees, on behalf of itself and all Indemnitees, that, with respect to any claim for Damages made by any Indemnitee prior to the day that is the 96th day following the Closing Date, such claim shall not be payable under the Escrow Agreement or this Agreement until after the 96th day following the Closing Date.  

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any Damages pursuant to this Article X if such Indemnitee shall have recovered such Damages in full from the Major Stockholders (or either of them) pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement.  

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Trust Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement, the covenants, agreements and obligations of Trustee under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement are made by Trustee solely in Trustees capacity as trustee of the Internet Investments Inc. Employee Shares Trust (the  ##### 

   

"TRUST"). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto hereby agree that
the Trustee shall have the benefit of provisions of Article 28(1) of the
Trusts (Jersey) Law 1984 (as amended) to the effect that any claim hereunder
against Trustee shall extend only to the Trust property.  

 (h) Trustee and Parent hereby agree that, in connection with any reduction in the Trustees Maximum Liability pursuant to the proviso contained in  _Section 10.2(b)(ii)(2)_, the amount of any subsequent increase in the Trusts assets shall be determined by reference to the most recent month-end statement of the Trusts assets, which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent.  

ARTICLE XI
