                    (i)   Cancellation of Certain Common Stock. Each share of

     their Subsidiaries (other than shares that are held in trust, managed,
     custodial or nominee accounts and the like and that are beneficially owned

                    (iii) Conversion of Main Street Common Stock.

                          (A)  Each share of Main Street Common Stock issued and

     canceled pursuant to Section 1.02(e)(i) and shares with respect to which
     the holder thereof duly exercises the right to dissent, if any, under

     paid and nonassessable shares of Sovereign Common Stock (the "Stock
     Consideration") determined by dividing $16.10 by the Average Final Price

                               (2)  if the Average Final Price is greater than
               $14.86, the Common Stock Exchange Ratio shall be 1.083.

                                       12

               (iv)  Stock Election. Subject to the immediately following
     sentence, each record holder of Main Street Common Stock, determined
     pursuant to Section 1.02(f), shall be entitled to elect to receive shares
     of Sovereign Common Stock for such holder's shares of Main Street Common
     Stock (a "Stock Election"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the minimum
     number of shares of Main Street Common Stock to be converted into the right
     to receive Sovereign Common Stock at the Effective Time will be equal to
     70% of the total number of shares of Main Street Common Stock issued and
     outstanding as of the close of business on the second trading day prior to
     the Effective Time (excluding for this purpose shares to be canceled
     pursuant to Section 1.02(e)(i)) (the "Minimum Stock Election Number").

               (v)   Stock Election Shares. As used herein, the term "Stock
     Election Shares" means shares of Main Street Common Stock for which a Stock
     Election has been made and the term "Aggregate Stock Election Share Number"
     means the aggregate number of shares of Main Street Common Stock covered by
     Stock Elections. If the Aggregate Stock Election Share Number equals or

               (vi)  Cash Election. Subject to the immediately following
     sentence, each record holder of shares of Main Street Common Stock,
     determined pursuant to Section 1.02(f), shall be entitled to elect to
     receive Cash Consideration for such holder's shares of Main Street Common
     Stock (a "Cash Election"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum
     number of shares of Main Street Common Stock to be converted into the right
     to receive cash at the Effective Time will be equal to 30% of the total
     number of shares of Main Street Common Stock issued and outstanding as of
     the close of business on the second trading day prior to the Effective
     Time, minus (x) the number of shares of Main Street Common Stock with

     this purpose shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.02(e)(i)) and (y)

     1.02(g)(ii) (together, the "Maximum Cash Election Number").

     Election Shares" means the shares of Main Street Common Stock for which a
     Cash Election has been made and the term "Aggregate Cash Election Share
     Number" means the aggregate number of shares of Main Street Common Stock
     covered by Cash Elections. If the Aggregate Cash

                                       13
<PAGE>

     Election Share Number exceeds the Maximum Cash Election Number, each Cash
     Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive cash or
     Sovereign Common Stock in the following manner:

                         (A)  a proration factor (the "Cash Proration Factor")
          shall be determined by dividing the Maximum Cash Election Number by
          the Aggregate Cash Election Share Number;

                         (B)  the number of Cash Election Shares covered by each
          Cash Election that will be converted into the right to receive Cash
          Consideration shall be determined by multiplying the Cash Proration
          Factor by such number of shares; and

                         (C)  each Cash Election Share other than those shares
          converted into the right to receive cash in accordance with Section
          1.02(e)(vii)(B) shall be converted into the right to receive Stock
          Consideration.

                 (viii)  Mixed Election. Subject to the immediately following
     sentence, each record holder of shares of Main Street Common Stock
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to elect to
     receive shares of Sovereign Common Stock for part of such holder's shares
     of Main Street Common Stock and cash for the remaining part of such
     holder's shares of Main Street Common Stock (the "Mixed Election" and,
     collectively with Stock Election and Cash Election, the "Election"). With
     respect to each holder of Main Street Common Stock who makes a Mixed
     Election, the shares of Main Street Common Stock such holder elects to be
     converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration shall be treated as
     Stock Election Shares for purposes of the provisions contained in Sections
     1.02(e)(iv) and (v) and the shares such holder elects to be converted into
     the right to receive Cash Consideration shall be treated as Cash Election
     Shares for purposes of the provisions contained in Sections 1.02(e)(vi) and
     (vii).

                 (ix)    Adjustment to Minimum Stock Election Number and Maximum
     Cash Election Number. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
     Minimum Stock Election Number shall be increased and the Maximum Cash
     Election Number shall be decreased if, but only to the extent, necessary to
     secure the tax opinion required by Sections 5.01(i) and 5.02(i).

                 (x)     Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding
     anything herein to the contrary, no fraction of a whole

                                       14
<PAGE>

     share of Sovereign Common Stock and no scrip or certificate therefore shall
     be issued in connection with the Merger. Any former Main Street shareholder
     who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
     Sovereign Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash in an amount
     equal to such fraction multiplied by the Average Final Price.

               (f)  Form of Election.
                    ----------------

                    (i)   Prior to the Effective Time, Sovereign shall appoint a
     bank or trust company subject to the approval of Main Street (which
     approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) as the exchange and
     paying agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment and exchange of the
     Cash and Stock Consideration.

                    (ii)  Sovereign shall prepare a form of election (the "Form
     of Election") subject to the approval of Main Street (which approval shall
     not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to be mailed by the Exchange Agent
     to the record holders of Main Street Common Stock not more than 60 Business
     Days or less than 20 Business Days prior to the election Date. The Form of
     Election shall be used by each record holder of shares of Main Street
     Common Stock who wishes to elect to receive Sovereign Common Stock or cash
     for any or all shares of Main Street Common Stock held by such holder,
     subject to the provisions of Section 1.02(e). The Exchange Agent shall use
     reasonable efforts to make the Form of Election available to all persons
     who become holders of Main Street Common Stock during the period between
     the record date (for the mailing of the Form of Election) and the Election
     Date. Any holder's election shall have been properly made only if the
     Exchange Agent shall have received at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m.,
     New York City time, on the Business Day specified in the Form of Election
     (or a later Business Day specified by Sovereign in a subsequent press
     release) (the "Election Date", which Election Date shall be two Business
     Days prior to the date on which the Effective Time will occur, a Form of
     Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by certificates that
     immediately prior to the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding
     shares of Main Street Common Stock (the "Main Street Certificates")
     representing the shares of Main Street Common Stock to which such Form of
     Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable
     for transfer on the books of Main Street (or by an appropriate guarantee of
     delivery of such Main Street Certificates as set forth in such Form of
     Election from a firm which is an "eligible guarantor institution" (as
     defined in Rule 17ad-15 under the Exchange Act); that such

                                       15
<PAGE>

     Main Street Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the
     time set forth in such guarantee of delivery).

                    (iii) Any Form of Election may be revoked by the stockholder
     submitting it to the Exchange Agent only by written notice received by the
     Exchange Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Election
     Date. If a Form of Election is revoked, the Main Street Certificate or Main
     Street Certificates (or guarantees of delivery, as appropriate) for the
     shares of Main Street Common Stock to which such Form of Election relates
     shall be promptly returned by the Exchange Agent to the stockholder of Main
     Street submitting the same.

                    (iv)  Sovereign shall have the discretion, which it may
     delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange Agent, to determine whether,
     Forms of Election have been properly completed, signed and submitted or
     revoked and to disregard immaterial defects in Forms of Election. The
     decision of Sovereign or the Exchange Agent in such matters shall be
     conclusive and binding. Neither Sovereign nor the Exchange Agent shall be
     under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in a Form of
     Election submitted to the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall also
     make all computations contemplated by Section 1.02(e) and all such
     computations shall be conclusive and binding on the holder of shares of
     Main Street Common Stock.

                    (v)   For the purposes hereof, a holder of shares of Main
     Street Common Stock who does not submit a Form of Election which is
     subsequently received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Date (the
     "Non-Election Shares") shall be deemed not to have made a Cash Election,
     Stock Election or Mixed Election. If Sovereign or the Exchange Agent shall
     determine that any purported Election was not properly made, the shares
     subject to such improperly made Election shall be treated as Non-Election
     Shares. Non-Election Shares shall be treated as Stock Election Shares.

               (g)  Stock Options.
                    -------------

                    (i)  On the Effective Date, each option to acquire Main
     Street Common Stock which is then outstanding ("Main Street Option"),
     whether or not exercisable, shall cease to represent a right to acquire
     shares of Main Street Common Stock and shall be converted automatically
     into an option to purchase shares of Sovereign Common Stock and the
     corresponding number of Sovereign Stock Purchase Rights, and Sovereign
     shall assume each Main Street Option, in accordance with the terms of the

                                       16
<PAGE>

     applicable Main Street Stock Option Plan and/or stock option agreement by
     which it is evidenced, except that from and after the Effective Date, (i)
     Sovereign and its Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof
     shall be substituted for Main Street and Main Street's Board of Directors
     or duly authorized committee thereof administering such Main Street Stock
     Option Plan, (ii) each Main Street Option assumed by Sovereign may be
     exercised solely for shares of Sovereign Common Stock and Sovereign Stock
     Purchase Rights, (iii) the number of shares of Sovereign Common Stock

     provided that any fractional shares of Sovereign Common Stock resulting
     from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest share, and
     (iv) the per share exercise price under each such Main Street Option shall
     be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under each such Main
     Street Option by the Common Stock Exchange Ratio, provided that such
     exercise price shall be rounded down to the nearest cent. Notwithstanding
     clauses (iii) and (iv) of the preceding sentence, each Main Street Option
     which is an "incentive stock option" shall be adjusted as required by
     Section 424 of the IRC, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, so as
     not to constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the option within
     the meaning of Section 424(h) of the IRC. Sovereign and Main Street agree

     Section 1.02(g).

                    (ii)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.02(g)(i),
     to the extent permitted by the Main Street Stock Option Plans, all Main
     Street Options exercisable on the Effective Date held by persons holding
     2,000 or fewer Main Street options in the aggregate shall be cancelled and
     the holder thereof shall receive cash in complete satisfaction for such
     Main Street Options in an amount equal to the positive difference between
     the Cash Consideration and the exercise price for each such Main Street
     Option; provided, however, that if no positive difference exists between
     the Cash Consideration and the exercise price for a Main Street Option
     covered by this Section 1.02(g)(ii), such Main Street Option shall be
     converted in the manner specified in Section 1.02(g)(i).

                    (iii) Within 90 days after the Effective Date, Sovereign
     shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any other successor or
     appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Sovereign Common Stock and
     Sovereign Stock Purchase Rights subject to the options referenced in

                                       17

     the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein for
     so long as such options remain outstanding.

               (h)  Surrender and Exchange of Main Street Stock Certificates.
                    --------------------------------------------------------

                    (i)  Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Effective Time,
     Sovereign shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit
     of holders of shares of Main Street Common Stock sufficient cash and
     certificates representing shares of Sovereign Common Stock to make all
     payments and deliveries to shareholders of Main Street pursuant to Section
     1.02(e). Any cash and certificates for Sovereign Common Stock deposited
     with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange
     Fund."

                    (ii) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable
     after the Effective Time (and in any case no later than five (5) days
     thereafter), Sovereign shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
     record holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
     represented issued and outstanding shares of Main Street Common Stock a
     letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery of the Main Street
     Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Main
     Street Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Main Street
     Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in customary
     form and have such other provisions as Sovereign may reasonably specify and
     instructions for effecting the surrender of such Main Street Certificates
     in exchange for the Cash Consideration and/or the Stock Consideration, as
     the case may be. Upon surrender of a Main Street Certificate to the
     Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
     completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
     documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder
     of such Main Street Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
     therefor (A) a certificate representing, in the aggregate, the whole number
     of shares of Sovereign Common Stock that such holder has the right to
     receive pursuant to Section 1.02(e) and/or (B) a check in the amount equal
     to the cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
     1.02(e). No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payment
     pursuant to Section 1.02(e). In the event of a transfer of ownership of
     Main Street Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of
     Main Street, a certificate representing, in the aggregate, the proper
     number of shares of Sovereign

                                       18
<PAGE>

     Common Stock and/or a check in the proper amount pursuant to Section
     1.02(e) may be issued with respect to such Main Street Common Stock, as the
     case may be, to such a transferee if the Main Street Certificate formerly
     representing such shares of Main Street Common Stock is presented to the
     Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
     effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer
     taxes have been paid. Persons who have submitted an effective Form of
     Election as provided in Section 1.02(f) and surrendered Main Street
     Certificates as provided therein shall be treated as if they have properly
     surrendered Main Street Certificates together with the letter of
     transmittal pursuant to this Section 1.02(h).

                    (iii) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
     dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of
     Sovereign Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
     paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Main Street Certificate with
     respect to the shares of Sovereign Common Stock that such Main Street
     Certificate holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Main
     Street Certificate until such holder shall surrender such Main Street
     Certificate in accordance with Section 1.02(h)(ii). Subject to the effect
     of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Main Street
     Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of shares of Sovereign
     Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (a) promptly
     after the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
     distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
     with respect to such whole shares of Sovereign Common Stock and (b) at the
     appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
     with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and
     a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
     whole shares of Sovereign Common Stock.

                    (iv)  No Further Ownership Rights. All shares of Sovereign
     Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of Main Street
     Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed
     to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
     to the shares of Main Street Common Stock.

                    (v)   Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the
     Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Main Street
     Certificates for twelve (12) months after the Effective Date shall be
     delivered to Sovereign or otherwise on the instructions of Sovereign and
     any

                                       19
<PAGE>

     holders of the Main Street Certificates who have not previously complied
     with this Section 1.02(h) shall thereafter look only to Sovereign for the
     Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Main Street Stock
     formerly represented thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
     Section 1.02(e) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Sovereign Common
     Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 1.02(e)(x) and
     any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Sovereign Common
     Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 1.02(h)(iii).

                    (vi)   No Liability. None of Sovereign, Main Street, any of
     their respective Affiliates or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
     Person in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund
     delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
     property, escheat or similar law.

                    (vii)  Investment of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent
     shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed
     by Sovereign; provided that, such investments shall be in obligations of or
     guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by a full faith and
     credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations
     rated P-1 and A-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard
     & Poor's Corporation, respectively. Any interest and other income resulting
     from such investments shall be payable to Sovereign.

                    (viii) Lost Certificates. If any Main Street Certificate
     shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit
     of that fact by the Person claiming such Main Street Certificate to be
     lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Sovereign the posting by such
     Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Sovereign may direct as
     indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
     such Main Street Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange
     for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Main Street Certificate the applicable
     Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Main Street Common Stock
     formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
     Sovereign Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant
     to Section 1.02(e)(x), and any dividends or other distributions on shares
     of Sovereign Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled
     pursuant to Section 1.02(h)(iii).

                    (ix)   Withholding Rights Sovereign shall be entitled to
     deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
     this Agreement to any holder of shares of Main Street Stock such amounts as

                                       20
<PAGE>

     it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
     payment under the IRC and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
     or any provisions of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
     amounts are so withheld by Sovereign, such withheld amounts shall be
     treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
     holder of the shares of Main Street Common Stock in respect of which such
     deduction and withholding was made by Sovereign.

                    (x)    Stock Transfer Books. At the close of business on the
     Effective Date, the stock transfer books of Main Street with respect to
     Main Street Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time
     shall be closed and, thereafter, there shall be no further registration of
     transfers on the records of Main Street of shares of Main Street Common
     Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time. From and after
     the Effective Time, the holders of Main Street Certificates shall cease to
     have any rights with respect to such shares of Main Street Common Stock
     formerly represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by
     law. On or after the Effective Time, any Main Street Certificates presented
     to the Exchange Agent or Sovereign for any reason shall be exchanged for
     the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Sovereign
     or Main Street Common Stock, as the case may be, formerly represented
     thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Sovereign Common Stock to
     which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 1.02(e)(x), and
     any dividends or other distributions on shares of Sovereign Common Stock to
     which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 1.02(h)(iii).

               (i)  Anti-Dilution Provisions. If Sovereign shall, at any time
                    ------------------------
before the Effective Date, (A) issue a dividend in shares of Sovereign Common
Stock, (B) combine the outstanding shares of Sovereign Common Stock into a
smaller number of shares, (C) subdivide the outstanding shares of Sovereign
Common Stock, or (D) reclassify the shares of Sovereign Common Stock, then, in
any such event, the number of shares of Sovereign Common Stock to be delivered
to Main Street shareholders who are entitled to receive shares of Sovereign
Common Stock in exchange for shares of Main Street Common Stock shall be
adjusted so that each Main Street shareholder shall be entitled to receive such
number of shares of Sovereign Common Stock as such shareholder would have been
entitled to receive if the Effective Date had occurred immediately prior to the
happening of such event. (By way of illustration, if Sovereign declares a stock
dividend of 7% payable with respect to a record date on or prior to the
Effective Date, the Common Stock Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted upward by 7%).
In addition, in the event that, prior to the Effective Date, Sovereign enters
into an

                                       21
<PAGE>

agreement pursuant to which shares of Sovereign Common Stock would be converted
into shares or other securities or obligations of another corporation, proper
provision shall be made in such agreement so that each Main Street shareholder
entitled to receive shares of Sovereign Common Stock in the Merger shall be
entitled to receive such number of shares or other securities or amount of
obligations of such other corporation as such shareholder would be entitled to
receive if the Effective Date had occurred immediately prior to the happening of
such event.

          Section 1.03  The Bank Merger. Sovereign and Main Street shall use
                        ---------------

Subsidiary; or (vi) any contract (other than this Agreement) limiting the
freedom of Main Street or any Main Street Subsidiary to engage in any type of
banking or bank-related business permissible under law.

               (b)  True and correct copies of agreements, plans, arrangements

          Section 2.09 Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage.
                       -----------------------------------------

               (a)  Main Street and the Main Street Subsidiaries have, or will
have as to property acquired after the date hereof, good and, as to real
property, marketable title to all assets and properties owned by Main Street or
any Main Street Subsidiary in the conduct of their businesses, whether such
assets and properties are real or personal, tangible or intangible, including
assets and property reflected in the balance sheets contained in the Main Street
Regulatory Reports and in the Main Street Financials or acquired subsequent
thereto (except to the extent that such assets and properties have been disposed
of for fair value, in the ordinary course of business, since the date of such
balance sheets), subject to no encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security
interests or pledges, except (i) those items which secure repurchase agreements
and liabilities for borrowed money from a Federal Home Loan Bank, (ii) statutory
liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which are being contested in good faith
and (iii) items permitted under Article IV. Main Street and the Main Street
Subsidiaries, as lessee, have the right under valid and subsisting leases of
real and personal properties used by Main Street and its Subsidiaries in the
conduct of their businesses to occupy or use all such properties as presently
occupied and used by each of them. Such existing leases and

                                       29
<PAGE>

commitments to lease constitute or will constitute operating leases for both tax
and financial accounting purposes and the lease expense and minimum rental
commitments with respect to such leases and lease commitments are as disclosed
in the Notes to the Main Street Financials.

               (b)  With respect to all agreements pursuant to which Main Street
or any Main Street Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement
to resell, if any, Main Street or such Main Street Subsidiary, as the case may
be, has a valid, perfected first lien or security interest in the securities or
other collateral securing the repurchase agreement, and the value of such
collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured thereby.

               (c)  Main Street and the Main Street Subsidiaries currently
maintain insurance considered by Main Street to be reasonable for their
respective operations and similar in scope and coverage to that maintained by
other businesses similarly engaged. Neither Main Street nor any Main Street
Subsidiary has received notice from any insurance carrier that (i) such
insurance will be cancelled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or
eliminated, or (ii) premium costs with respect to such policies of insurance
will be substantially increased. There are presently no material claims pending
under such policies of insurance and no notices have been given by Main Street
or Main Street Bank under such policies. All such insurance is valid and
enforceable and in full force and effect, and within the last three years Main
Street and Main Street Bank have received each type of insurance coverage for
which they have applied and during such periods have not been denied
indemnification for any material claims submitted under any of their insurance
policies.

          Section 2.10 Legal Proceedings. Except as set forth in the Main Street
                       -----------------
Disclosure Schedule, neither Main Street nor any Main Street Subsidiary is a
party to any, and there are no pending or, to the best of Main Street's
knowledge, threatened legal, administrative, arbitration or other proceedings,
claims (whether asserted or unasserted), actions or governmental investigations
or inquiries of any nature (i) against Main Street or any Main Street
Subsidiary, (ii) to which Main Street or any Main Street Subsidiary's assets are
or may be subject, (iii) challenging the validity or propriety of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) which could adversely
affect the ability of Main Street to perform under this Agreement, except for
any proceedings, claims, actions, investigations or inquiries referred to in
clauses (i) or (ii) which, if adversely determined, individually or in the
aggregate, could not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Main Street.

          Section 2.11 Compliance With Applicable Law.
                       ------------------------------

               (a)  Main Street and Main Street Subsidiaries hold all licenses,
franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their
businesses under, and have complied in all material respects with, applicable
laws, statutes, orders, rules or regulations of any federal, state or local
governmental authority relating to them, other than where such failure to hold
or such noncompliance will neither result in a limitation in any material
respect on the conduct of their businesses nor otherwise have a Material Adverse
Effect on Main Street.

               (b)  Except for the MOU or as disclosed on the Main Street
Disclosure Schedule, (i) Main Street and each Main Street Subsidiary is in
substantial compliance with all of the statutes, regulations or ordinances which
each Regulatory Authority applicable to them enforces; (ii) no Regulatory
Authority has threatened to revoke any license, franchise, permit or
governmental authorization which is material to Main Street or any Main Street
Subsidiary required or threatened to require Main Street or any Main Street
Subsidiary, to enter into a cease and desist order or memorandum of
understanding with it; and (iii) no Regulatory Authority has restricted or
limited the operations of Main Street or any Main Street Subsidiary, including
without limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends (any such
memorandum or order described in this sentence is hereinafter referred to as a
"Regulatory Agreement"). Neither Main Street nor any Main Street Subsidiary has
consented to or entered into any Regulatory Agreement, except for the MOU. Main
Street has no reason to believe that it will not receive regulatory approval for
the Merger. Main Street received a rating of "satisfactory" in connection with
its last CRA examination. On the date of the Agreement Main Street has no reason
to believe that it is not in substantial compliance with the material terms of
the MOU.

          Section 2.12 ERISA. Main Street has previously delivered to Sovereign
                       -----
true and complete copies of all employee pension benefit plans within the
meaning of ERISA Section 3(2), including profit sharing plans, employee stock
ownership plan, stock purchase plans, deferred compensation and supplemental
income plans, supplemental executive retirement plans, employment agreements,
annual executive and administrative incentive plan or long term incentive plans,
severance plans, policies and agreements, group insurance plans, and all other
employee welfare benefit plans within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(1)
(including vacation pay, sick leave, short-term disability, long-term
disability, and medical plans) and all other employee benefit plans, policies,
agreements and arrangements, all of which are set forth in the Main Street
Disclosure Schedule,

                                       31
<PAGE>

sponsored or contributed to for the benefit of the employees or former employees
(including retired employees) and any beneficiaries thereof or directors or
former directors of Main Street or any Main Street Subsidiary, together with (i)
the most recent actuarial (if any) and financial reports relating to those plans
which constitute "qualified plans" under IRC Section 401(a), (ii) the most
recent annual reports relating to such plans filed by them, respectively, with
any government agency, and (iii) all rulings and determination letters which
pertain to any such plans. Neither Main Street, any Main Street Subsidiary, nor
any pension plan maintained by Main Street or any Main Street Subsidiary, has
incurred, directly or indirectly, within the past six (6) years any liability
under Title IV of ERISA (including to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation)
or to the IRS with respect to any pension plan qualified under IRC Section
401(a) which liability has resulted in or will result in a Material Adverse
Effect with respect to Main Street, except liabilities to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation pursuant to ERISA Section 4007, all of which have been
fully paid, nor has any reportable event under ERISA Section 4043 occurred with
respect to any such pension plan which would result in a Material Adverse
Effect. With respect to each of such plans that is subject to Title IV of ERISA,
the present value of the accrued benefits under such plan, based upon the
actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the plan's most recent
actuarial report did not, as of its latest valuation date, exceed the then
current value of the assets of such plan allocable to such accrued benefits.
Neither Main Street nor any Main Street Subsidiary has incurred or is subject to
any liability under ERISA Section 4201 for a complete or partial withdrawal from
a multiemployer plan. All "employee benefit plans," as defined in ERISA Section
3(3), comply and within the past six (6) years have complied in all material
respects with (i) relevant provisions of ERISA and (ii) in the case of plans
intended to qualify for favorable income tax treatment, provisions of the IRC
relevant to such treatment. No prohibited transaction (which shall mean any
transaction prohibited by ERISA Section 406 and not exempt under ERISA Section
408 or any transaction prohibited under IRC Section 4975) has occurred within
the past six (6) years with respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by
Main Street or any Main Street Subsidiary which would result in the imposition,
directly or indirectly, of an excise tax under IRC Section 4975 or other penalty
under ERISA or the IRC, which, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted in
or will result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Main Street. Main
Street and the Main Street Subsidiaries provide continuation coverage under
group health plans for separating employees and "qualified beneficiaries" in
accordance with the provisions of IRC Section 4980B(f). Such group health plans
are in material compliance with Section 1862(b)(1) of the Social Security Act.

financial point of view.

          Section 2.14 Environmental Matters. To the knowledge of Main Street,
                       ---------------------
except as set forth on the Main Street Disclosure Schedule, neither Main Street
nor any Main Street Subsidiary, nor any properties operated by Main Street or
any Main Street Subsidiary during Main Street's use or ownership has been or is
in violation of or liable under any Environmental Law which violation or
liability, individually or in the aggregate, resulted in, or will result, in a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to Main Street. There are no actions, suits
or proceedings, or demands, claims, notices or investigations (including without
limitation notices, demand letters or requests for information from any
environmental agency) instituted or pending, or to the knowledge of Main Street,
threatened, relating to the liability of any property owned or operated by Main
Street or any Main Street Subsidiary under any Environmental Law.

Street filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act which is incorporated by
reference into the Registration Statement (including the Prospectus/Proxy

                                       33
<PAGE>

Statement) will not, at the time the Registration Statement is declared
effective pursuant to the Securities Act and as of the date the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement is mailed to shareholders of Main Street and up to and including the
date of the meeting of shareholders of Main Street to which such
Prospectus/Proxy Statement relates, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading. The information supplied, or to be supplied,
by Main Street for inclusion in the Applications will, at the time such
documents are filed with any Regulatory Authority and up to and including the
date of the attainment of any required regulatory approvals or consents, be
accurate in all material respects.

          Section 2.17 Securities Documents. The Securities Documents filed or
                       --------------------
to be filed by Main Street under the Exchange Act at any time since December 31,

respects, with the Exchange Act and all applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC.

          Section 2.18 Related Party Transactions. Except as disclosed in the
                       --------------------------
Securities Documents filed by Main Street, in the footnotes to the Main Street
Financials, or in the Main Street Disclosure Schedule, Main Street is not a
party to any transaction (including any loan or other credit accommodation, but
excluding deposits in the ordinary course of business) with any Affiliate of
Main Street (except a Main Street Subsidiary).  All such transactions (a) were
made in the ordinary course of business, (b) were made on substantially the same
terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time
for comparable transactions with other Persons, and (c) did not involve more
than the normal risk of collectability or present other risks or unfavorable
features.  No loan or credit accommodation to any Affiliate of Main Street is
presently in default or, during the three year period prior to the date of this
Agreement, has been in default or has been restructured, modified or extended.
Neither Main Street nor Main Street Bank has been notified that principal and
interest with respect to any such loan or other credit accommodation will not be
paid when due or that the loan grade classification accorded such loan or credit
accommodation by Main Street Bank is inappropriate.

          Section 2.19 Schedule of Termination Benefits. The Main Street
                       --------------------------------
Disclosure Schedule includes a schedule of the present value as of March 31,
2002 of the maximum amount of termination benefits and related payments which
would be payable to the individuals identified thereon, excluding any options to
acquire Main Street Common Stock granted to such individuals, under any and all
employment agreements, special termination agreements, supplemental executive

                                       34

retirement plans, deferred bonus plans, deferred compensation plans, salary
continuation plans, or any other pension benefit or welfare benefit plan
maintained by Main Street solely for the benefit of executive officers of Main
Street or any Main Street Subsidiary (the "Benefits Schedule"), assuming that
the Closing Date occurs on March 31, 2002 and that the employment of such
individuals terminates immediately thereafter. No other individuals are entitled
to benefits under any such plans. The amounts paid to the individuals identified
in Schedule 2.19 shall not exceed the amounts set forth thereon adjusted to
reflect changes in interest rates and in actual as opposed to estimated
compensation data (except for the bonus amounts). To the best knowledge of Main
Street, both (i) the present value of the maximum amount of termination benefits
and related payments specified, including required gross-up payments under
Section 280G of the IRC, on the Benefits Schedule with respect to each named
individual and (ii) the maximum aggregate amount set forth on the Benefits
Schedule are true and correct in all material respects. Except as set forth in
Main Street Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, no Main
Street director had deferred any compensation accrued by Main Street.

standards would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Main Street.

          Section 2.21 Takeover Laws. Main Street has taken all action required
                       -------------
to be taken by it in order to exempt this Agreement, the Bank Plan of Merger and

of ERISA Section 3(1) (including vacation pay, sick leave, short-term

under IRC Section 401(a), (ii) the most recent annual reports relating to such
plans filed by them, respectively, with any government agency, and (iii) all
rulings and determination letters which pertain to any such plans. Neither
Sovereign, any Sovereign Subsidiary, nor any pension plan maintained by
Sovereign or any Sovereign Subsidiary, has incurred, directly or indirectly,
within the past six (6) years any liability under Title IV of ERISA (including
to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) or to the IRS with respect to any
pension plan qualified under IRC Section 401(a) which liability has resulted in

Section 4007, all of which have been fully paid, nor has any reportable event

that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, the present value of the accrued benefits
under such plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes
in the plan's most recent actuarial report did not, as of its latest valuation
date, exceed the then current value of the assets of such plan allocable to such
accrued benefits. Neither Sovereign nor any Sovereign Subsidiary has incurred or
is subject to any liability under ERISA Section 4201 for a complete or partial

ERISA, and (ii) in the case of plans intended to qualify for favorable income
tax treatment, provisions of the IRC relevant to such treatment. No prohibited
transaction (which shall mean any transaction prohibited by ERISA Section 406
and not exempt under ERISA Section 408 or any transaction prohibited under IRC
Section 4975) has occurred within the past six (6) years with respect to any
employee benefit plan maintained by Sovereign or any Sovereign Subsidiary that
would result in the imposition, directly or indirectly, of an excise tax under
IRC Section 4975 or other penalty under ERISA or the IRC, which individually or
in the aggregate, has resulted in or will result in a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to Sovereign. Sovereign and the Sovereign Subsidiaries provide
continuation coverage under group health plans for separating employees and
"qualified beneficiaries" in accordance with the provisions of IRC Section
4980B(f). Such group health plans are in compliance with Section 1862(b)(1) of

Material Adverse Effect with respect to Sovereign. There are no actions, suits

limitation notices, demand letters or requests for information from any
environmental agency) instituted or pending, or to the knowledge of Sovereign,
threatened, relating to the liability of any property owned or operated by
Sovereign or any Sovereign Subsidiary under any Environmental Law.

     resulting therefrom, take any action that would give rise to a right of
     payment to any individual under any employment agreement; or

                    (xv)   agree to do any of the foregoing.

          For purposes of this Section 4.01, it shall not be considered in the
ordinary course of business for Main Street or any Main Street Subsidiary to do

                        -------------------------------

               (a)  Main Street and Sovereign shall prepare a Prospectus/Proxy
Statement to be mailed to shareholders of Main Street in connection with the
meeting of shareholders of Main Street to consider and the

                                       49
<PAGE>

transactions contemplated hereby, and to be filed by Sovereign with the SEC in
the Registration Statement, which Prospectus/Proxy statement shall conform to
all applicable legal requirements. Sovereign shall, following the preparation
thereof, file the Registration Statement with the SEC and Main Street and
Sovereign shall use all reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing. Sovereign will advise Main Street, promptly after Sovereign
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any
stop order or the suspension of the qualification of the shares of capital stock
issuable pursuant to the Registration Statement, or the initiation or threat of
any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the
amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional
information. Sovereign shall use its best efforts to obtain, prior to the
effective date of the Registration Statement, all necessary state securities
laws or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Sovereign will provide Main Street with as many
copies of such Registration Statement and all amendments thereto promptly upon
the filing thereof as Main Street may reasonably request.

               (b)  Sovereign and Main Street will prepare all Applications to
Regulatory Authorities and make all filings for, and use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, all
necessary permits, consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations of all
Regulatory Authorities necessary or advisable to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

               (c)  Main Street will furnish Sovereign with all information
concerning Main Street and Main Street Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Registration Statement and any
Application or filing made by or on behalf of Sovereign to any Regulatory
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Bank Plan of Merger.

               (d)  Sovereign and Main Street shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other on, all
information which appears in any filing made with or written materials submitted
to the SEC, any Regulatory Authority or any third party in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Bank Plan of Merger. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably
and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult
with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents,
approvals and

                                       50
<PAGE>

authorizations of the SEC, Regulatory Authorities and third parties necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the

matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

               (e)  Sovereign will promptly furnish Main Street with copies of
all written communications to, or received by Sovereign or any Sovereign

                        --------------------------
shall each use its best efforts in good faith, and each of them shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts in good faith, to take or
cause to be taken all action necessary or desirable on its part using its best
efforts so as to permit completion of the Merger and the Bank Merger, as soon as
practicable after the date hereof, including, without limitation, (A) obtaining
the consent or approval of each individual, partnership, corporation,
association or other business or professional entity whose consent or approval
is required or desirable for consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including assignment of leases without any change in terms), provided
that neither Main Street nor any Main Street Subsidiary shall agree to make any
payments or modifications to agreements in connection therewith without the
prior written consent of Sovereign, and (B) requesting the delivery of
appropriate opinions, consents and letters from its counsel and independent
auditors. No party hereto shall take, or cause, or to the best of its ability
permit to be taken, any action that would substantially impair the prospects of
completing the Merger and the Bank Merger pursuant to this Agreement and the
Bank Plan of Merger; provided that nothing herein contained shall preclude
Sovereign or Main Street or from exercising its rights under this Agreement or
the Stock Option Agreement.

          Section 4.05  Certain Agreements.
                        ------------------

               (a)  In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, in
which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Date, a director or officer or
employee of Main Street or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties")
is, or is threatened to be, made a party to a suit based in whole or in part on,
or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is
or was a director, officer or employee of Main Street, any of the Main Street's
Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or
arising before or after the

                                       51
<PAGE>

Effective Date, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts
to defend against and respond thereto to the extent permitted or required by the
BCL and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Main Street. On or after the
Effective Date, Sovereign shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless all prior
and then-existing directors and officers of Main Street and any Main Street
Subsidiary, against (i) all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement (with the
approval of Sovereign which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or
in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in
whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such
person is or was a director, officer or employee of Main Street or any Main
Street Subsidiary, whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Date and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or
after, the Effective Date ("Indemnified Liabilities") and (ii) all Indemnified
Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of,
or pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, to the
same extent as such officer, director or employee may be indemnified by Main
Street or any Main Street Subsidiary as of the date hereof including the right
to advancement of expenses, provided, however, that any such officer, director
or employee of Main Street or any Main Street Subsidiary shall not be
indemnified by Sovereign and/or Sovereign Bank if such indemnification is
prohibited by applicable law.

               (b)  Sovereign shall maintain Main Street's existing directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy (or a policy providing comparable
coverage amounts on terms generally no less favorable, including Sovereign's
existing policy if it meets the foregoing standard) covering persons who are
currently covered by such insurance for a period of five years after the
Effective Date; provided, however, that in no event shall Sovereign be obligated
to expend, in order to maintain or provide insurance coverage pursuant to this
Section 4.05(b), any amount per annum in excess of 150% of the amount of the
annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by Main Street for such insurance
(the "Maximum Amount"). If the amount of the annual premiums necessary to
maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount,
Sovereign shall use all reasonable efforts to maintain the most advantageous
policies of directors' and officers' insurance obtainable for an annual premium
equal to the Maximum Amount. In the event that Sovereign acts as its own insurer
for all of its directors and officers with respect to matters typically covered
by a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, Sovereign's
obligations under this Section 4.05(b) may be satisfied by such self insurance,
so long as its senior debt ratings by Standard & Poor's Corporation and Moody's
Investors Services, Inc. are not lower than such ratings as of the date hereof.

<PAGE>

               (c)  Sovereign agrees to honor and Sovereign agrees to cause
Sovereign Bank to honor all terms and conditions of all existing employment
contracts and special termination agreements disclosed in the Main Street
Disclosure Schedule. In the event that any employee of Main Street who is a
party to an employment contract or a special termination agreement with Main
Street, or who is covered by Main Street's change in control policy (as
identified on Main Street's Disclosure Schedule), is offered and accepts
employment with Sovereign or any Sovereign subsidiary, Sovereign shall pay to
each such individual within five (5) days of the Effective Date, fifty percent
(50%) of the total amount to which such individual is entitled under such
agreement or policy and shall pay the remaining fifty percent (50%) of such
total amount in the event, but only in the event, that such employee's
employment with Sovereign or a Sovereign Subsidiary terminates on or prior to
the first annual anniversary date of the Effective Date.

               (d)  In the event that Sovereign or any of its respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case the successors
and assigns of such entity shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 4.05.

               (e)  Sovereign agrees that, effective with the Effective Date, it
shall assume Main Street's 9.25% Subordinated Debentures due December 31, 2029
and all of Main Street's obligations under the related trust indenture, and
shall take all action necessary or appropriate in accordance therewith,
including, if required by the trustee, execution of a supplemental indenture and
other appropriate documents or certificates.

          Section 4.06  No Other Bids and Related Matters. So long as this
                        ---------------------------------

authorize or permit any of its directors, officers, employees or agents, to
directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiries relating
to, or the making of any proposal which relates to, an Acquisition Transaction
(as defined below) (ii) respond to any inquiry relating to an Acquisition
Transaction, except as otherwise advised in a written legal opinion of outside
counsel to Main Street to the effect that a failure to do so would result in a
breach of their fiduciary obligations under Pennsylvania law (provided that a
copy of such written opinion shall have been provided to Sovereign together with
a written notice that Main Street intends to respond to the inquiry no earlier
than three (3) Business Days following receipt by Sovereign of such notice),
(iii) recommend or endorse an Acquisition Transaction, (iv) participate in any
discussions or negotiations

                                       53
<PAGE>

regarding an Acquisition Transaction, (v) provide any third party (other than
Sovereign or an affiliate of Sovereign) with any nonpublic information in
connection with any inquiry or proposal relating to an Acquisition Transaction,
(vi) enter into an agreement with any other party with respect to an Acquisition
Transaction or (vii) fail to recommend and support the Merger to Main Street
shareholders. Main Street will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations previously conducted with any
parties other than Sovereign with respect to any of the foregoing, and will take
all actions necessary or advisable to inform the appropriate individuals or
entities referred to in the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken
in this Section 4.06. Main Street will notify Sovereign orally (within one day)
and in writing (as promptly as practicable) if any inquiries or proposals
relating to an Acquisition Transaction are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such negotiations or discussions are sought to be
initiated or continued with, Main Street. As used in this Agreement,
"Acquisition Transaction" shall mean one of the following transactions with a
party other than Sovereign of an affiliate of Sovereign (i) a merger or
consolidation, or any similar transaction, involving Main Street or a Main
Street Subsidiary, (ii) a purchase, lease or other acquisition of all or a
substantial portion of the assets or liabilities of Main Street or a Main Street
Subsidiary or (iii) a purchase or other acquisition (including by way of share
exchange, tender offer, exchange offer or otherwise) of a substantial interest
in any class or series of equity securities of Main Street or a Main Street
Subsidiary.

          Section 4.07  Duty to Advise; Duty to Update Disclosure Schedule. Each
                        --------------------------------------------------
party shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event having a
Material Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would or would be reasonably
likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants set forth herein. Each party shall update its respective
Disclosure Schedule as promptly as practicable after the occurrence of an event
or fact which, if such event or fact had occurred prior to the date of this
Agreement, would have been disclosed in such Disclosure Schedule. The delivery
of such updated Schedule shall not relieve a party from any breach or violation
of this Agreement and shall not have any effect for the purposes of determining
the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Sections 5.01(c) and 5.02(c)
hereof, as applicable.

          Section 4.08  Conduct of Sovereign's Business.  From the date of this

customers of Sovereign and Sovereign Subsidiaries and others with whom business
relationships exist.

               (b)  Main Street shall provide to Sovereign a copy of the minutes
of any meeting of the Board of Directors of Main Street or any Main Street
Subsidiary, or any committee thereof, or any senior management committee,
promptly after such minutes are approved at a subsequent meeting of the board or
committee, but in any event within thirty (30) days of the meeting of such board

          Section 4.11  Employee Benefits and Termination Benefits.
                        ------------------------------------------

               (a)  Employee Benefits. On and after the Effective Date, the
                    -----------------
employee pension and welfare benefit plans of Sovereign and Main Street (as well
as any other plan of Main Street providing for benefits not subject to ERISA)
may, at Sovereign's election and subject to the requirements of the IRC,
continue to be maintained separately or consolidated or terminated, except as
set forth below. In connection with implementation of the foregoing, the
following provisions and guidelines shall apply:

                    (i)   Sovereign Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("Sovereign
                          ---------------------------------------------------
     ESOP"). Employees of Main Street and Main Street Subsidiaries who become
     -----
     employees of Sovereign or a Sovereign Subsidiary shall become entitled to
     participate in the Sovereign ESOP in accordance with its terms by treating
     them as newly employed individuals without any prior service credit under
     such plan.

                    (ii)  Sovereign 401(k) Retirement Plan ("Sovereign 401(k)
                          ---------------------------------------------------
     Plan"). Employees of Main Street and Main Street Subsidiaries who become
     -----
     employees of Sovereign or a Sovereign Subsidiary shall become entitled to
     participate in the Sovereign 401(k) Plan in accordance with its terms. In
     this regard, each such employee shall (A) receive, for purposes of
     participation and vesting only, credit for all service with Main Street or
     a Main Street Subsidiary credited to each such employee under Main Street's
     401(k) Plan as of the Effective Date, and (B) enter the Sovereign 401(k)
     Plan as soon as administratively feasible following completion of three (3)
     months of service (within the meaning of the Sovereign 401(k) Plan) with
     either Main Street or Sovereign, or both.

                    (iii) Main Street Savings Plan ("Main Street 401(k) Plan").
                          --------------------------------------------------
     After the Effective Date, Sovereign will initially continue to maintain
     Main Street's 401(k) Plan until its participants generally become eligible
     to participate in the Sovereign 401(k) Plan. Thereafter, Sovereign shall
     have the right, but not the obligation, to combine the two plans on such
     terms as it deems appropriate and in accordance with applicable law.

                    (iv)  Sovereign and Main Street Nonqualified Deferred
                          -----------------------------------------------
     Compensation Plans ("Excess Benefit Plans"). Following the Merger,
     ------------------------------------------

                                       59
<PAGE>

     Sovereign will, as soon as administratively feasible, consolidate the
     Excess Benefit Plans maintained by Sovereign and Main Street to supplement
     certain pension benefits lost by some employees by reason of limitations
     contained in the IRC. Such consolidation shall be effected in such a manner
     that no person receive redundant benefits or lose existing benefits. The
     intent of the preceding sentence is that affected employees of Main Street
     and Main Street Subsidiaries generally shall be entitled only to the sum of
     (A) the benefits accrued under the Main Street Excess Benefit Plan(s) as of
     the plan consolidation, and (B) the benefits accrued thereafter under the
     combined Excess Benefit Plan.

                    (v)   Welfare Benefit Plans. After the Effective Date, the
                          ---------------------
     welfare benefit plans of Sovereign and Main Street (and their respective
     subsidiaries) shall initially remain unchanged. Sovereign shall undertake a
     study, in consultation with appropriate professional advisors, with a view
     toward the possible combination of some or all of such plans or the
     benefits provided thereunder. Following such study, Sovereign shall take
     such action with respect to such plans (which may include the
     implementation of new benefits, reduction or elimination of some benefits,
     and the alteration of the respective cost allocation between employer and
     employee) as it deems appropriate under the circumstances. In the event of
     any termination of or consolidation of a Main Street welfare plan with any
     Sovereign welfare plan, all employees of Main Street and Main Street
     Subsidiaries who are eligible for continued coverage under the Main Street
     welfare plan shall have immediate coverage under any successor welfare plan
     without the necessity of satisfying a waiting period for coverage of any
     pre-existing condition. Sovereign does not provide welfare benefits to
     retired employees.

                    (vi)  Main Street Bonus Plans and Arrangements. Main Street
                          ----------------------------------------
     may continue to administer such bonus programs and arrangements as are
     disclosed pursuant to this Agreement through the Effective Date, with such
     equitable modifications as may be appropriate to take into account the
     circumstances of the Merger and the timing thereof; provided, however, that
     aggregate payments under Main Street bonus plans and arrangements for the
     fiscal year ending December 31, 2001 shall not exceed the amount set forth
     in the Main Street Disclosure Schedule. For purposes of determining
     expenses of Main Street under the Main Street bonus plans and arrangements,
     any expenses incurred by Main Street as a result of Section 4.10(a)(viii)
     of this Agreement, as a result of the bond fund hedge referenced in Section
     4.10(a)(xiv) of this Agreement or as a result of any loss of earnings
     resulting from a replacement, at the request of Sovereign, of

                                       60
<PAGE>

     U.S. government agency obligations held in Main Street's investment
     portfolio shall be disregarded.

                    (vii)  Other Main Street Plans.  From the date of this
                           -----------------------
     Agreement through the Effective Date of the Merger, without the prior
     written consent of Sovereign and except as otherwise expressly permitted by
     this Agreement, no further benefits, grants or awards shall be made
     available under any other Main Street plans to employees or directors,
     including, without limitation, the granting of stock options, stock
     appreciation rights, restricted stock, and performance shares.

               (b)  Termination Benefits.  Main Street shall use its reasonable
                    --------------------
best efforts to cause to be delivered to Sovereign within five (5) Business Days
following execution of this Agreement with respect to each executive officer
named on the Benefits Schedule included in the Main Street Disclosure Schedule,
the written acknowledgment of each such individual in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit 3 pursuant to which each such individual agrees and acknowledges that
the dollar amount set forth opposite such individual's name on such Benefits
Schedule is the maximum amount that would be due to such individual under any
employment agreement, special termination agreement, supplemental executive
retirement plan, deferred bonus plan, deferred compensation plan, salary
continuation plan, or any other pension benefit or welfare benefit plan
maintained by Main Street solely for the benefit of officers of Main Street or
Main Street Subsidiaries assuming a termination of such individual's employment
on January 1, 2002 and assuming December 31, 2001 as the Closing Date. Main
Street and Sovereign acknowledge and agree that the amounts shown on the
Benefits Schedule and the letter of acknowledgment for each officer named herein
reflect a good faith estimate of the maximum amounts that will be payable to
such individuals under the circumstances described and may be subject to
adjustment upon an actual termination of employment in order to reflect
increases in such individuals' compensation and benefit plans consistent with
past practices for routine periodic increases.

               (c)  Severance Policy.  Sovereign agrees to cause Sovereign Bank
                    ----------------
to provide severance pay, as set forth below, to any full-time, active employee
of Main Street whose employment is terminated hereafter in connection with the
Merger up to twelve (12) months beyond the Effective Date, because (i) such
employee's position is eliminated, or (ii) such employee is not offered or
retained in comparable employment (i.e., a position of generally similar job
description or responsibilities in a location within a thirty (30)-mile radius
from either such employee's work location with Main Street or residence),
excluding any

                                       61
<PAGE>

employee (i) who has an existing employment or consulting agreement with Main
Street or any Main Street Subsidiary,(ii) who has accepted an offer from
Sovereign of noncomparable employment or (iii) whose employment is terminated
for Cause (as defined below), provided such employee executes such documentation
                              --------
as Sovereign may reasonably require, including Sovereign's customary form of
release and provided such employee does not leave employment with Main Street or
Sovereign prior to the date the systems conversion occurs. The severance Pay to
be provided by Sovereign under this subsection shall equal two (2) weeks' pay
for each full year of continuous service (determined based on the date of the
employee's commencement of employment with Main Street) with a minimum severance
benefit of eight (8) weeks' pay and a maximum severance benefit of fifty-two
(52) weeks' pay. For purposes of this Section 4.11(c), "Cause" shall mean
termination because of the employee's personal dishonesty, failure to meet
established performance goals and standards, misconduct, breach of fiduciary
duty involving personal profit, intentional failure to perform stated duties or
willful violation of any law, rule or regulation (other than traffic violations
or similar offenses). The benefits provided to terminated Main Street employees
under this subsection are the only severance benefits payable by Main Street to
such employees (excluding severance benefits provided under existing employment
or consulting agreements or as otherwise required by law), except for employees
who do not execute the documentation required by Sovereign, which employees
shall be entitled to the termination benefits provided under Main Street's
normal severance policies. The benefits payable to Main Street's employees under
this subsection or otherwise shall in any event be in lieu of any termination
benefits to which such employees would otherwise be entitled under Sovereign's
or Sovereign Bank's severance policies or programs then in effect.

               (d)  Intention Regarding Future Employment.  Sovereign and
                    -------------------------------------
Sovereign Bank shall use their reasonable best efforts to inform the employees
of Main Street at least sixty (60) days prior to the Effective Date of the
likelihood of such employees having continued employment with Sovereign Bank
following the Effective Date and, where appropriate in Sovereign Bank's
judgment, it will consider for employment opportunities at Sovereign Bank such
employees who would otherwise be terminated.

               (e)  Retention Bonuses.  Notwithstanding Section 4.11(c), each
                    -----------------
employee of Main Street or of Main Street Bank identified in the Main Street
Disclosure Schedule shall be entitled to receive a "retention" bonus from Main
Street (or the applicable Main Street Subsidiary) as determined by the executive
officers of Main Street (after consultation with Sovereign) and as set forth on
the Main Street Disclosure Schedule in the event that such employee remains an

                                       62
<PAGE>

employee of Main Street (or the applicable Main Street Subsidiary), until the
date the systems conversion occurs (or such other date established or adjusted
by Sovereign not to exceed forty-five 45 days following the date the system
conversion occurs) or is terminated prior to the date of the systems conversion,
but after the Effective Date, and satisfactorily fulfills the duties and
responsibilities of the position of such employee of Main Street (or the
applicable Main Street Subsidiary) through the employee's termination date;
provided, however, that retention bonuses, in the aggregate, shall not exceed
$500,000.

               (f)  Outplacement Services.  Sovereign shall provide customary
                    ---------------------
outplacement services to all Main Street employees, including executive
officers, whose employment is terminated in connection with the Merger.

          Section 4.12 Affiliate Letter.  Main Street shall use its best
                       ----------------
efforts to cause to be delivered to Sovereign, concurrently with the execution
of this Agreement or within five (5) Business Days thereafter, the Letter
Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 1, executed by each director, officer and
any Affiliate of Main Street.

          Section 4.13 Sovereign Rights Agreement.  Sovereign agrees that any
                       --------------------------
Sovereign Rights issued pursuant to the Sovereign Rights Agreement shall be
issued with respect to each share of Sovereign Common Stock issued pursuant to
the terms hereof regardless whether there has occurred a "Distribution Date"
under the terms of such Sovereign Rights Agreement prior to the Effective Date,
as well as to take all action necessary or advisable to enable the holder of
each such share of Sovereign Common Stock to obtain the benefit of such
Sovereign Stock Purchase Rights notwithstanding their prior distribution,
including without limitation, amendment of the Sovereign Rights Agreement.

          Section 4.14 Advisory Board.  On the Effective Date, Sovereign Bank
                       --------------
shall establish the Main Street Advisory Board (the "Main Street Advisory
Board"), which shall consist of all members of the Main Street Board immediately
prior to the Effective Date other than such members who become directors of
Sovereign Bank. The Main Street Advisory Board shall be maintained for a term of
thirty-six (36) months from the Effective Date. Each member of the Main Street
Advisory Board shall be paid for services as such the greater of the fees for
such service according to the fee schedule to be established by Sovereign, or
Main Street's existing fee schedule set forth in Main Street Disclosure
Schedule; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything else in this Section
4.14, (i) if a member fails to attend at least 25% of the meetings of the Main
Street Advisory Board called within any year, such member will not have any
rights to additional fees thereafter as a Main Street Advisory Board member;
(ii) no attendance fees

                                       63
<PAGE>

shall be paid for meetings not actually attended; and (iii) Sovereign Bank shall
have no obligation to continue the services of any advisory director who, in the
reasonable judgment of Sovereign Bank, acts in a manner detrimental to Sovereign
Bank. In the event that Sovereign Bank terminates, suspends or disbands the Main
Street Advisory Board, fails to require or request the attendance of a member
with respect to at least ten (10) meetings of the Main Street Advisory Board
and/or committee thereof within a single year or removes a member of the Main
Street Advisory Board other than because such member acted in a manner
detrimental to Bank, in each case prior to the end of the thirty-six (36) month
period contemplated by this Section 4.14 and subject to the proviso of the
preceding sentence, any member affected by any such action or failure shall
nonetheless be paid the full fees (assuming at least ten (10) meetings annually
had been held) pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence or the amount
contemplated by clause (ii) thereof, whichever is greater, with respect to such
thirty-six (36) month period. In no event shall aggregate annual fees payable to
the Main Street Advisory Board exceed $123,900 (the average of the aggregate
annual fees paid in each of 1998, 1999 and 2000).

          Section 6.01 Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated on or at

<PAGE>

                    (i)    if the Closing Date shall not have occurred on or
     before March 31, 2002, unless the failure of such occurrence shall be due
     to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform
     or observe, in any material respect, its agreements set forth in this
     Agreement required to be performed or observed by such party on or before
     the Closing Date; provided, however, that such date may be extended to June
     30, 2002 by Sovereign by written notice to Main Street if the Closing shall
     not have occurred because of the failure to obtain approval from one or
     more Regulatory Authorities whose approval is required in connection with
     this Agreement; or

                    (ii)   if either party has received a final unappealable
     administrative order from a Regulatory Authority whose approval or consent
     has been requested that such approval or consent will not be granted;

                    (iii)  unless in the case of both Section 6.01(b)(i) and
     6.01(b)(ii) hereof the failure of such occurrence shall be due to the
     failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or
     observe in any material respect its agreements set forth herein required to
     be performed or observed by such party on or before the Closing Date.

               (c)  by Main Street if Main Street's shareholders fail to approve
this Agreement at the special meeting of Main Street shareholders called for
that purpose; provided a period of at least thirty days elapsed between the date
of mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and that a quorum is present at such
special meeting.

               (d)  By Main Street, on the Closing Date if both of the following
conditions are satisfied:

               (1)  the Sovereign Market Value as of the close of business on
     the Determination Date shall be less than $9.04; and

               (2)  (i) the quotient obtained by dividing the Sovereign Market
     Value as of the close of business on the Determination Date by $12.92 (such
     number being referred to herein as the "Sovereign Ratio") shall be less
     than (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing the Index Price on the
     Determination Date by the Index Price on the Starting Date and subtracting
     0.15 from the quotient in this clause (2)(ii); provided, however, that if
     Sovereign delivers to Main Street on the Closing Date a written notice
     increasing the Common Stock Exchange Ratio to an amount which, when

                                       68
<PAGE>

     multiplied by the Sovereign Market Value equals $10.98, then no Termination
     of this Agreement shall occur under this Section 6.01(k).

the meanings indicated.

stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,

hereof.

     The obligations set forth herein shall terminate concurrently with any
termination of the Agreement.

     This Letter Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of

                            STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT
                            ----------------------

     THIS STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT ("Stock Option Agreement"), dated July 16,
2001, is by and between SOVEREIGN BANCORP, INC., a Pennsylvania corporation
("Sovereign") and MAIN STREET BANCORP, INC., a Pennsylvania corporation ("Main
Street").

                                  BACKGROUND
                                  ----------

     1. Sovereign and Main Street desire to enter into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated July 16, 2001 (the "Agreement"), providing, among other things,
for the acquisition by Sovereign of Main Street through the merger of Main
Street with and into Sovereign, with Sovereign surviving the merger (the
"Merger").

     2. As a condition to Sovereign executing the Agreement, Main Street is
granting to Sovereign an option to purchase up to that number of shares of
common stock, 1.00 par value of Main Street (the "Common Stock"), as shall equal
19.9% of shares of Common Stock of Main Street issued and outstanding
immediately prior to such purchase, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set
forth.

                                   AGREEMENT
                                   ---------

     In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements
set forth herein, Sovereign and Main Street, intending to be legally bound
hereby, agree:


     1. Grant of Option.
        ---------------

          (a)  Main Street hereby grants to Sovereign, on the terms and
conditions set forth herein, an unconditional irrevocable option to purchase
(the "Option") up to 2,083,600 shares (as adjusted as set forth herein, the
"Option Shares") of Common Stock at a price per share (the "Option Price") equal
to $10.75, provided, however, that in no event shall the number of Option Shares
for which the Option is exercisable exceed 19.9% of the issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock of Main Street without giving effect to any shares
subject to or issued pursuant to the Option.

          (b)  In the event that any additional shares of Common Stock are
issued or otherwise become outstanding after the date of this Agreement (other
than pursuant to this Stock Option Agreement), the number of shares of Common
Stock subject to the Option shall be increased so that, after such issuance,
such number together with any shares of Common Stock previously issued pursuant
hereto, equals 19.9% of the number of shares of Common Stock then issued and
outstanding without giving effect to any shares subject or issued pursuant

                                       79
<PAGE>

to the Option. Nothing contained in this Section 1(b) or elsewhere in this Stock
Option Agreement shall be deemed to authorize Issuer to issue shares in breach
of any provision of the Agreement.

     2. Exercise of Option. Provided that (i) Sovereign shall not on the date of
        ------------------
exercise be in breach of the agreements or covenants contained in the Agreement
or herein, and (ii) no preliminary or permanent injunction or other order
against the delivery of shares covered by the Option issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction in the United States shall be in effect, upon or after
the occurrence of a Triggering Event (as such term is hereinafter defined) and
until termination of this Stock Option Agreement in accordance with the
provisions of Section 23, Sovereign may exercise the Option, in whole or in
part, at any time or one or more times, from time to time. As used herein, the
term "Triggering Event" means the occurrence of any of the following events:

          (a)  a person or group (as such terms are defined in the Securities
     Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and
     regulations thereunder), other than Sovereign or an affiliate of Sovereign,
     acquires beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the
     Exchange Act) of 15% or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock
     (excluding any shares eligible to be reported on Schedule 13G of the
     Securities and Exchange Commission);

          (b)  a person or group, other than Sovereign or an affiliate of
     Sovereign, enters into an agreement, letter of intent, or similar document
     with Main Street pursuant to which such person or group or any affiliate of
     such person or group would (i) merge or consolidate, or enter into any
     similar transaction, with Main Street, (ii) acquire all or substantially
     all of the assets or liabilities of Main Street or all or substantially all
     of the assets or liabilities of Main Street Bank, the wholly-owned
     subsidiary of Main Street ("Main Street Bank"), or (iii) acquire beneficial
     ownership of securities representing, or the right to acquire beneficial
     ownership or to vote securities representing, 15% or more of the then
     outstanding shares of Common Stock (excluding any shares eligible to be
     reported on Schedule 13G of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or the
     then outstanding shares of common stock of Main Street Bank; or

          (c)  a person or group, other than Sovereign or an affiliate of
     Sovereign, publicly announces a bona fide proposal (including a written
     communication that is or becomes the subject of public disclosure) for (i)
     any merger, consolidation or acquisition of all or substantially all the
     assets or liabilities of Main Street or all or substantially all the assets
     or liabilities of Main Street Bank, or any other business combination
     involving Main Street or Main Street Bank, or (ii) a transaction involving
     the transfer of beneficial ownership of securities representing, or the
     right to acquire beneficial ownership or to vote securities representing,
     15% or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock or the then
     outstanding shares of common stock of Main Street Bank (collectively, a
     "Proposal"), and thereafter, if such Proposal has not been Publicly
     Withdrawn (as such

                                       80
<PAGE>

     term is hereinafter defined) at least 30 days prior to the meeting of
     shareholders of Main Street called to vote on the Merger, Main Street's
     shareholders fail to approve the Merger by the vote required by applicable
     law at the meeting of shareholders called for such purpose or such meeting
     has been cancelled; or

          (d)  a person or group, other than Sovereign or an affiliate of
     Sovereign, makes a bona fide Proposal and thereafter, but before such
     Proposal has been Publicly Withdrawn, Main Street willfully takes any
     action in a manner which would likely result in the failure of either party
     to satisfy a material condition to the closing of the Merger or materially
     reduce the value of the transaction to Sovereign; or

          (e)  the Board of Directors of Main Street shall (i) fail to recommend
     and endorse the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby or (ii)
     withdraw, modify, or change in a manner adverse to Sovereign its approval
     or recommendation of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated
     thereby, or (iii) recommend or endorse an Acquisition Transaction (as
     defined in Section 4.06 of the Agreement); or

          (f)  Main Street breaches, in any material respect, any binding term
     of the Agreement with respect to the Merger which would permit Sovereign to
     terminate the Agreement or this Stock Option Agreement after a Proposal is
     made and before it is Publicly Withdrawn or publicly announces an intention
     to authorize, recommend or accept any such Proposal; provided, however,
     that any purchase of shares upon exercise of the Option shall be subject to
     compliance with applicable law.

     If more than one of the transactions giving rise to a Triggering Event
under this Section 2 is undertaken or effected, then all such transactions shall
give rise only to one Triggering Event, which Triggering Event shall be deemed
continuing for all purposes hereunder until all such transactions are abandoned.

     "Publicly Withdrawn" for purposes of this Section 2 shall mean an
unconditional bona fide withdrawal of the Proposal coupled with a public
announcement of no further interest in pursuing such Proposal or in acquiring
any controlling influence over Main Street or in soliciting or inducing any
other person (other than Sovereign or an affiliate of Sovereign) to do so.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation of Main Street to issue
Option Shares upon exercise of the Option shall be deferred (but shall not
terminate) (i) until the receipt of all required governmental or regulatory
approvals or consents necessary for Main Street to issue the Option Shares, or
Sovereign to exercise the Option, or until the expiration or termination of any
waiting period required by law, or (ii) so long as any injunction or other
order, decree or ruling issued by any federal or state court of competent
jurisdiction is in effect which prohibits the sale or delivery of the Option
Shares, and, in each case, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary set
forth herein, the Option shall not expire or otherwise terminate.

                                       81
<PAGE>

     Main Street shall notify Sovereign promptly in writing of the occurrence of
any Triggering Event known to it, it being understood that the giving of such
notice by Main Street shall not be a condition to the right of Sovereign to
exercise the Option.  Subject to compliance with the applicable banking and
securities laws or regulations, Main Street will not take any action which would
have the effect of preventing or disabling Main Street from delivering the
Option Shares to Sovereign upon exercise of the Option or otherwise performing
its obligations under this Stock Option Agreement.  In the event Sovereign
wishes to exercise the Option, Sovereign shall send a written notice to Main
Street (the date of which is hereinafter referred to as the "Notice Date")
specifying the total number of Option Shares it wishes to purchase and a place
and date between two and  ten business days inclusive from the Notice Date for
the closing of such a purchase (a "Closing"); provided, however, that a Closing
shall not occur prior to two days after the later of receipt of any necessary
regulatory approvals or the expiration of any legally required notice or waiting
period, if any.

     3.   Repurchase of Option by Main Street.
          -----------------------------------

          (a)  At the request of Sovereign at any time and from time to time
commencing upon the first occurrence of a Repurchase Event (as hereinafter
defined) and ending upon termination of this Stock Option Agreement in
accordance with the provisions of Section 23, Main Street shall repurchase from
Sovereign upon Sovereign's request (x) all or any portion of the Option Shares
not yet purchased by Sovereign pursuant hereto and (y) all or any portion shares
of Common Stock purchased by Sovereign pursuant hereto with respect to which
Sovereign then has beneficial ownership.  The date on which Sovereign exercises
its rights under this Section 3 is referred to as the "Request Date."  Such
repurchase shall be at an aggregate price (the "Section 3 Repurchase
Consideration") equal to the sum of:  (i) the aggregate Purchase Price paid by
Sovereign for any shares of Common Stock being repurchased which were acquired
pursuant to the Option and with respect to which Sovereign then has beneficial
ownership; (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Applicable Price (as defined
below) for each share of Common Stock over (y) the Option Price (subject to
adjustment pursuant to Section 6), multiplied by the number of shares of Common
Stock being repurchased with respect to which the Option has not been exercised;
and (iii) the excess, if any, of the Applicable Price over the Option Price
(subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 6) paid (or, in the case of Option
Shares with respect to which the Option has been exercised, but the Closing has
not occurred, payable) by Sovereign for each share of Common Stock being
repurchased with respect to which the Option has been exercised and with respect
to which Sovereign then has beneficial ownership, multiplied by the number of
such shares.

          (b)  If Sovereign exercises its rights under this Section 3, Main
Street shall, within ten (10) business days after the Request Date, pay the
Section 3 Repurchase Consideration to Sovereign in immediately available funds,
and contemporaneously with such payment, Sovereign shall surrender to Main
Street the Option and the certificate evidencing the shares of Common Stock
being repurchased with respect to which Sovereign then has beneficial

                                       82
<PAGE>

ownership, and Sovereign shall warrant that it has sole record and beneficial
ownership of such shares, and that the same are then free and clear of all
liens, claims, charges and encumbrances of any kind whatsoever. In the event of
the repurchase of less than all of the Option Shares with respect to which the
Option has not been exercised, Main Street shall issue a new Stock Option
Agreement to Sovereign reflecting the remaining balance, if any, of Option
Shares after giving effect to such repurchase. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to
the extent that prior notification to or approval of any banking agency or
department of any federal or state government, including without limitation the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking, or the respective staffs
thereof (the "Regulatory Authority"), is required in connection with the payment
of all or any portion of the Section 3 Repurchase Consideration, Sovereign shall
have the ongoing option to revoke its request for repurchase pursuant to Section
3, in whole or in part, or to require that Main Street deliver from time to time
that portion of the Section 3 Repurchase Consideration that it is not then so
prohibited from paying and promptly file the required notice or application for
approval and expeditiously process the same (and each party shall cooperate with
the other in the filing of any such notice or application and the obtaining of
any such approval), in which case the ten (10) business day period of time that
would otherwise run pursuant to the preceding sentence for the payment of the
portion of the Section 3 Repurchase Consideration shall run instead from the
date on which, as the case may be, any required notification period has expired
or been terminated or such approval has been obtained and, in either event, any
requisite waiting period shall have passed. If any Regulatory Authority
disapproves of any part of Main Street's proposed repurchase pursuant to this
Section 3, Main Street shall promptly give notice of such fact to Sovereign. If
any Regulatory Authority prohibits repurchase pursuant to this Section 3, Main
Street shall promptly give notice of such fact to Sovereign. If any Regulatory
Authority prohibits the repurchase in part but not in whole, then Sovereign
shall have the right (i) to revoke the repurchase request or (ii) to the extent
permitted by such Regulatory Authority, determine whether the repurchase should
apply to the Option and/or Option Shares subject to the repurchase request and
to what extent to each, and Sovereign shall thereupon have the right to exercise
the Option as to the number of Option Shares for which the Option was
exercisable at the Request Date less the sum of the number of shares covered by
the Option in respect of which payment has been made pursuant to Section
3(a)(ii) and the number of shares covered by the portion of the Option (if any)
that has been repurchased. Sovereign shall notify Main Street of its
determination under the preceding sentence within five (5) business days of
receipt of notice of disapproval of the repurchase.

          (c)  For purposes of this Agreement, the "Applicable Price" means the
highest of (i) the highest price per share of Common Stock paid for any such
share by the person or groups described in Section 3(d)(i), (ii) the price per
share of Common Stock received by a holder of Common Stock in connection with
any merger or other business combination transaction described in Section
3(d)(ii), (iii) or (iv), or (iii) the highest closing sales price per share of
Common Stock quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market during the sixty (60) business
days preceding the Request Date; provided, however, that in the event of a sale
of less than all of Main Street's assets, the Applicable Price shall be the sum
of the price paid in such sale for such

                                       83
<PAGE>

assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of Main Street's as
determined by a nationally-recognized investment banking firm selected by
Sovereign, divided by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the
time of such sale. If the consideration to be offered, paid or received pursuant
to either of the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) shall be other than in cash, the
value of such consideration shall be determined in good faith by an independent
nationally-recognized investment banking firm selected by Sovereign and
reasonably acceptable to Main Street, which determination shall be conclusive
for all purposes of this Agreement.

     (d) As used herein, a Repurchase Event shall occur if (i) any person or
group (as such terms are defined in the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder), other than Sovereign or an affiliate of Sovereign,
acquires beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the
Exchange Act) of, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 15% or more
of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock, (ii) Main Street shall have
merged or consolidated with any person, other than Sovereign or an affiliate of
Sovereign, and shall not be the surviving or continuing corporation of such
merger or consolidation, (iii) any person, other than Sovereign or an affiliate
of Sovereign, shall have merged into Main Street and Main Street shall be the
surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then-outstanding
shares of Common Stock have been changed into or exchanged for stock or other
securities of Main Street or any other person or cash or any other property or
the outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such merger shall
after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares and share
equivalents of the surviving corporation or (iv) Main Street shall have sold or
otherwise transferred more than 15% of its consolidated assets to any person,
other than Sovereign or an affiliate of Sovereign.

     4.  Payment and Delivery of Certificates.  At any Closing hereunder, (a)
         ------------------------------------
Sovereign will make payment to Main Street of the aggregate price for the Option
Shares so purchased by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Main Street, (b) Main Street will deliver to Sovereign a
stock certificate or certificates representing the number of Option Shares so
purchased, registered in the name of Sovereign or its designee, in such
denominations as were specified by Sovereign in its notice of exercise, and (c)
Sovereign will pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of the Option Shares so purchased.

     A legend will be placed on each stock certificate evidencing Option Shares
issued pursuant to this Stock Option Agreement, which legend will read
substantially as follows:


          "The shares of stock evidenced by this certificate have not been the
      subject of a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of
      1933, as amended (the "Act"), and declared effective by the Securities and
      Exchange Commission. These shares may not be sold, transferred or
      otherwise disposed of prior to such time unless Main Street Bancorp, Inc.
      receives an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to it stating that an
      exemption from the registration provisions of the Act is available for
      such transfer."

                                       84
<PAGE>

     5.  Registration Rights.  On or after the date of first exercise of the
         -------------------
Option and upon receipt of a written request from Sovereign, Main Street shall
prepare and file as soon as practicable a registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with the Securities
and Exchange Commission covering the Option and such number of Option Shares as
Sovereign shall specify in its request, and Main Street shall use its best
efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective in order
to permit the sale or other disposition of the Option and the Option Shares,
provided that Sovereign shall in no event have the right to have more than one
such registration statement become effective, and provided further that Main
Street shall not be required to prepare and file any such registration statement
in connection with any proposed sale with respect to which counsel to Main
Street delivers to Main Street and to Sovereign its opinion to the effect that
no such filing is required under applicable laws and regulations with respect to
such sale or disposition; provided, however, that Main Street may delay any
registration of Option Shares above for a period not exceeding sixty (60) days
in the event that Main Street shall in good faith determine that any such
registration would adversely affect an offering or contemplated offering of
other securities by Main Street.  Sovereign shall provide all information
reasonably requested by Main Street for inclusion in any registration statement
to be filed hereunder.  In connection with such filing, Main Street shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Sovereign such
certificates, opinions, accountant's letters and other documents as Sovereign
shall reasonably request and as are customarily provided in connection with
registration of securities under the Securities Act.  Main Street shall provide
to Sovereign such number of copies of the preliminary prospectus and final
prospectus and any amendments and supplements thereto as Sovereign may
reasonably request.

     All expenses incurred by Main Street in complying with the provisions of
this Section 5, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees,
reasonable printing expenses, reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for
Main Street and blue sky fees and expenses, shall be paid by Main Street.
Underwriting discounts and  commissions to brokers and dealers relating to the
Option Shares, fees and disbursements of counsel to Sovereign and any other
expenses incurred by Sovereign in connection with such filing shall be borne by
Sovereign.  In connection with such filing, Main Street shall indemnify and hold
harmless Sovereign against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or
several, to which Sovereign may become subject, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based
upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
contained in any preliminary or final registration statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and Main Street will
reimburse Sovereign for any legal or other expense reasonably incurred by
Sovereign in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or action; provided, however, that Main Street will not be
liable in any case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability
arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
or omission or alleged omission made in such preliminary

                                       85
<PAGE>

or final registration statement or such amendment or supplement thereto in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by or on
behalf of Sovereign specifically for use in the preparation thereof. Sovereign
will indemnify and hold harmless Main Street to the same extent as set forth in
the immediately preceding sentence but only with reference to written
information furnished by or on behalf of Sovereign for use in the preparation of
such preliminary or final registration statement or such amendment or supplement
thereto; and Sovereign will reimburse Main Street for any legal or other expense
reasonably incurred by Main Street in connection with investigating or defending
any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, no indemnifying party shall be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent.

     6.  Adjustment Upon Changes in Capitalization.  In the event of any change
         -----------------------------------------
in the Common Stock by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, recapitalizations,
combinations, conversions, divisions, exchanges of shares or the like, then the
number and kind of Option Shares and the Option Price shall be appropriately
adjusted.

     7.  Filings and Consents.  Each of Sovereign and Main Street will use its
         --------------------
commercially reasonable efforts to make all filings with, and to obtain consents
of, all third parties and governmental authorities necessary to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Stock Option Agreement.

     8.  Representations and Warranties of Main Street.  Main Street hereby
         ---------------------------------------------
represents and warrants to Sovereign as follows:

           (a) Due Authorization.  Main Street has the requisite corporate power
               -----------------
and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Stock Option Agreement and
all corporate action necessary for execution, delivery and performance of this
Stock Option Agreement has been duly taken by Main Street.  This Stock Option
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Main Street,
enforceable against Main Street in accordance with its terms (except as may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors' rights or by general equity principles).

           (b) Authorized Shares.  Main Street has taken all necessary corporate
               -----------------
action to authorize and reserve for issuance all shares of Common Stock that may
be issued pursuant to any exercise of the Option.

     9.  Representations and Warranties of Sovereign.  Sovereign hereby
         -------------------------------------------
represents and warrants to Main Street that Sovereign has the requisite
corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Stock Option
Agreement and all corporate action necessary for execution, delivery and
performance of this Stock Option Agreement has been duly taken by Sovereign.
This Stock Option  Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Sovereign, enforceable against Sovereign in accordance with its terms (except
as may be

                                       86
<PAGE>

limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors' rights or by general equity principles). Sovereign or its
assignee agrees to execute a standard investment representation letter with
respect to its acquisition of any Main Street securities acquired in connection
with this transaction.

     10.  Specific Performance.  The parties hereto acknowledge that damages
          --------------------
would be an inadequate remedy for a breach of this Stock Option Agreement and
that the obligations of the parties hereto shall be specifically enforceable.

     11.  Entire Agreement.  This Stock Option Agreement and the Agreement
          ----------------
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties or any of them with respect to the subject
matter hereof.

     12.  Assignment or Transfer.  Sovereign may not sell, assign or otherwise
          ----------------------
transfer its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to any
person or group of persons other than to a subsidiary of Sovereign subject to
compliance with applicable securities laws.  Sovereign represents that it is
acquiring the Option for Sovereign's own account and not with a view to, or for
sale in connection with, any distribution of the Option or the Option Shares.
Sovereign is aware that neither the Option nor the Option Shares is the subject
of a registration statement filed with, and declared effective by, the
Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 5 of the Securities Act,
but instead each is being offered in reliance upon the exemption from the
registration requirement provided by Section 4(2) thereof and the
representations and warranties made by Sovereign in connection therewith.

     13.  Amendment of Stock Option Agreement.  By mutual consent of the
          -----------------------------------
parties hereto, this Stock Option Agreement may be amended in writing at any
time, for the purpose of facilitating performance hereunder or to comply with

July 16, 2001

Sovereign Bancorp, Inc.
2000 Market Street
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  19103

Gentlemen:

     I, the undersigned, hereby acknowledge and agree that an amount equal to
$__________ is a good faith estimate of the maximum amount that I would be
entitled to receive from Main Street, any Main Street Subsidiary or any of their
respective successors or assigns pursuant to any employment agreement, special
termination agreement, supplemental executive retirement plan, deferred
compensation plan, salary continuation plan, incentive or bonus plan, or any
other benefit or welfare plan, assuming that the Merger were to occur on March
31, 2002 and further assuming that my employment with Main Street or any Main
Street subsidiary (or any of their respective successors or assigns) were
terminated for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, immediately
thereafter.  All capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have
the meanings given to them in the Agreement.

     This letter is subject to the acknowledgment and agreement of Sovereign
Bancorp, Inc., as evidenced below, that the amount shown above reflects a good
faith estimate of the amounts that will be payable to me as hereinbefore
specified, and may be subject to adjustment upon an actual termination of my
employment to reflect increases in my compensation and benefits due to the
passage of time or in accordance with the terms of Main Street's employee
benefit plans and past practices for routine increases.

                                  Sincerely,

Acknowledged and Agreed to:
SOVEREIGN BANCORP, INC.

                                                              EXHIBIT 4

                  FORM OF TAX OPINION OF STEVENS & LEE, P.C.
                  ------------------------------------------

     Sovereign and Main Street shall have received an opinion of Stevens & Lee,
P.C. substantially to the effect that, under the provisions of the IRC:

          1. The Merger will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning
             of Section 368(a) of the IRC;

          2. Sovereign and Main Street will each be a party to the
             reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the IRC;

          3. No gain or loss will be recognized by Sovereign or Main Street as a
             result of the Merger (except for amounts resulting from any
             required change in accounting methods or any income or deferred
             gain recognized under the relevant consolidated return
             regulations);

          4. Main Street shareholders who receive only Sovereign common stock
             for all of their shares of Main Street stock will not recognize any
             gain or loss with respect to shares of Sovereign stock received
             (except with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional share
             interest in Sovereign common stock);

          5. Each Main Street shareholder who receives Sovereign common stock
             and cash (other than cash in lieu of a fractional share interest in
             Sovereign common stock) in exchange for the shareholder's shares of
             Main Street common stock will recognize the gain, if any, realized
             by the shareholder, in an amount not in excess of the amount of
             cash received, but will not recognize any loss on the exchange;

          6. Each Main Street shareholder's aggregate tax basis in any shares of
             Sovereign common stock received in the transaction (including
             fractional shares deemed received and redeemed) will be the same as
             the aggregate tax basis of the shares of Main Street common stock
             the Main Street shareholder surrendered in exchange therefor,
             decreased by the amount of any cash received by the shareholder and
             increased by the amount of income or gain recognized by the
             shareholder in the exchange; and

          7. Each Main Street shareholder's holding period in any shares of
             Sovereign common stock received in the transaction (including any
             fractional shares deemed received and redeemed) will ,in each
             instance, include the period during which the shares of Main Street
             common stock surrendered in exchange therefor were held.

                                       92
<PAGE>

          8. The Rights transferred with the shares of Sovereign common stock
             will not constitute "other property" with the meaning of Section
             356(a)(1)(B) of the IRC.

     In rendering such opinion, Stevens & Lee, P.C. will be entitled to receive
and rely upon customary certificates and representation of officers of Sovereign
and Main Street.
