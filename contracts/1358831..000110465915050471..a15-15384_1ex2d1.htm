attributable to the operation of the Pipeline Assets from and after the

Property Costs incurred from and after the Effective Time, and the Purchase
Price shall be adjusted accordingly pursuant to **Section 2.2**. Seller, by
virtue of its ownership of the Acquired Companies, shall be entitled to all
products and proceeds attributable to the operation of the Pipeline Assets
prior to the Effective Time, and to all other income, proceeds, receipts and
credits earned with respect to the Pipeline Assets prior to the Effective
Time, and shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect
to) all Property Costs incurred prior to the Effective Time, and the Purchase

attributable to the period before or after the Effective Time shall be based

is performed. For clarification, the date an item or work is ordered is not
the date of a transaction for settlement purposes, but rather the date on
which the item ordered is delivered to the job site, or the date on which the
work ordered is performed, shall be the relevant date. Non-Income Taxes,
right-of-way fees, insurance premiums and other Property Costs that are paid
periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable
period falling before and the number of days in the applicable period falling
on or after the day that includes the Effective Time. In each case, the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted to reflect that Purchaser, by virtue of its
ownership of the Acquired Companies following the Closing, shall be
responsible for the portion allocated to the period from and after the
Effective Time and Seller, by virtue of its ownership of the Acquired
Companies prior to the Closing, shall be responsible for the portion allocated
to the period before the Effective Time.

Purchaser represents and acknowledges that (a) Seller and its Affiliates and
its and their respective equity owners, members, representatives, officers,
employees or agents have not made and are not making any representations or
warranties of any kind or nature whatsoever, oral or written, express,
statutory or implied, with respect to Seller, the Membership Interests, the
Acquired Companies, the Pipeline Assets or the prospects thereof and (b)

hereby, Purchaser has relied solely on the basis of its own independent due
diligence investigation of the Pipeline Assets, except to the limited extent
of the representations, warranties and covenants of Seller set forth in
**Article 4** and **Article 5** herein and in any certificate required to be
executed and delivered by Seller at the Closing.

and will continue to maintain, lease bonds, area-wide bonds or any other
surety bonds as may be required by, and in accordance with, such state or
federal regulations governing the ownership and operation of the Pipeline

 **ARTICLE 7 
COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES**

 



 

 **Section 7.1** **_Access_**.

 



 

(a) Between the date of execution of this Agreement and continuing until the
Closing Date, Seller will give Purchaser and its representatives access to the
Pipeline Assets and access to the Records in Sellers or the Acquired
Companies possession, for the purpose of conducting an investigation of the
Acquired Companies and the Pipeline Assets and copying the Records, but only
to the extent that Seller may do so without violating any obligations to any
third party and to the extent that Seller or the Acquired Companies have
authority to grant such access without breaching any restriction binding on
Seller or the Acquired Companies. Such access by Purchaser shall be limited to

 



      
 

 



 

Sellers normal business hours, and any weekends and after hours requested by
Purchaser that can be reasonably accommodated by Seller, and Purchasers
investigation shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes interference with
the operation of the Pipeline Assets. All information obtained by Purchaser
and its representatives under this Section shall be subject to the terms of
**Section 11.4(b)(v)** and the terms of that certain confidentiality
agreement among Anadarko EandP Onshore LLC, Western Gas Partners LP and
Purchaser dated March 9, 2015, as amended (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

 



 

(b) Between the date of this Agreement and the date that is five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, upon prior written notice to Seller, Purchaser
shall have the right to conduct a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of all
or any portion of the Pipeline Assets (the "Assessment"), which shall be
conducted by TRC Companies, Inc. The Assessment shall be conducted at the sole
cost and expense of Purchaser, and shall be subject to the indemnity
provisions of **Section 7.1(c)** and **Section 11.4(b)(v)**. Purchaser may
not operate equipment or conduct any sampling, boring, drilling or other
invasive investigative activity with respect to the Pipeline Assets ("Invasive
Activity") without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may be
withheld in Sellers sole discretion. If Purchaser wishes to conduct an
Invasive Activity, Purchaser shall furnish for Sellers review and approval
(which may be withheld in Sellers sole discretion) a proposed scope of such
Invasive Activity, including a description of the activities to be conducted
and a description of the approximate locations of such activities. Seller
shall have the right to be present during any Assessment of the Pipeline
Assets and shall have the right, at its option and expense, to split samples
with Purchaser, if applicable. The access granted to Purchaser under this
**Section 7.1(b)** shall be limited to Sellers normal business hours or as
otherwise agreed in advance, and Purchasers investigation shall be conducted
in a manner that minimizes interference with the operation of the Pipeline
Assets. Purchaser shall abide by Sellers safety rules, regulations, and
operating policies (including the execution and delivery of any documentation
or paperwork, e.g., confidentiality agreements or liability releases, with
respect to Purchasers access to any of the Pipeline Assets) while conducting
its due diligence evaluation of the Pipeline Assets. After completing any
Assessment of the Pipeline Assets, Purchaser shall, at its sole cost and
expense, restore the Pipeline Assets to their condition prior to the
commencement of such Assessment, unless Seller requests otherwise, and if
Seller permits Purchaser to conduct an Invasive Activity, shall promptly
dispose of all corings or other investigative-derived wastes generated in the
course of such Invasive Activity. Purchaser shall maintain, and shall cause
its officers, employees, representatives, consultants and advisors to
maintain, all information obtained by Purchaser pursuant to any Assessment or
other environmental due diligence activity (the "Environmental Information")
as strictly confidential in perpetuity, unless disclosure of any facts
discovered through such Assessment is required, on the advice of counsel,
under any Environmental Laws, other Laws, or to comply with any subpoena,
court or administrative order or, following the Closing, any contractual or
legal obligation of Purchaser. Purchaser shall provide Seller with a copy of
the final draft of all environmental reports prepared by, or on behalf of,
Purchaser with respect to any Assessment or permitted Invasive Activity
conducted on the Pipeline Assets. In the event that any necessary disclosures
under applicable Environmental Laws are required, upon the advice of counsel,
with respect to matters discovered by any Assessment conducted by, for or on
behalf of Purchaser, Purchaser agrees that Seller shall be the responsible
party for disclosing such matters to the appropriate Governmental Bodies.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) **PURCHASER HEREBY AGREES TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, RELEASE, PROTECT, SAVE
AND HOLD HARMLESS THE SELLER INDEMNITEES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES
AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY DUE DILIGENCE ACTIVITY CONDUCTED
BY PURCHASER OR ITS AGENTS, WHETHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE EXECUTION OF THIS
AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY LOSSES RESULTING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, FROM THE SOLE,
ACTIVE, PASSIVE, GROSS, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY
OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW BY THE SELLER INDEMNITEES.**

 



 

 **Section 7.2** **_Government Reviews_**.

 



 

(a) Seller and Purchaser shall in a timely manner (a) make all required
filings, if any, with and prepare applications to and conduct negotiations
with, each Governmental Body as to which such filings, applications or
negotiations are necessary or appropriate in the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (b) provide such information as each may
reasonably request to make such filings, prepare such applications and conduct
such negotiations. As promptly as practicable and not later than the second
(2nd) Business Day following the date of this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser
shall promptly make all filings and notifications with all Governmental Bodies
that may be necessary or advisable under the HSR Act and similar applicable
Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and shall request
early termination or waiver of any applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act. Purchaser and Seller will each pay fifty percent (50%) of any fees (other
than their respective legal fees) required with respect to any filings made
pursuant to the HSR Act.

 



 

(b) Each Party shall cooperate with and use all commercially reasonable
efforts to assist the other with respect to such filings, applications and
negotiations. Purchaser and Seller may not, without the consent of the other
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), (i) cause any such filing or submission applicable to it to be
withdrawn or refiled for any reason, including to provide the applicable
Governmental Body with additional time to review any or all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) consent to any voluntary
extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary
delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby at the
behest of any Governmental Body. Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to supply promptly any information and documentary material
that may be requested by any Governmental Body pursuant to any applicable Laws
in connection with such filings or submissions. Seller and Purchaser shall use
their reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the early termination or the
expiration of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other
applicable Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as is reasonably practicable, (ii) resolve any objections as may be
asserted by any Governmental Body with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and (iii) contest and resist any action or proceeding
instituted (or threatened in writing to be instituted) by any Governmental
Body challenging the transactions contemplated hereby as violating any
applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Following the Closing, with respect to any consents or approvals of
Governmental Bodies that are customarily obtained after the indirect transfer
of properties similar to the Pipeline Assets, the Parties agree to take all
other actions reasonably required of it by Governmental Bodies having
jurisdiction to obtain all such regulatory approvals with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to this transaction, and to use its reasonable commercial efforts to
obtain the approval by such Governmental Bodies, as applicable, of any
documents requiring approval from such Governmental Body in order for
Purchaser to be recognized by such Governmental Body as the owner of the
Pipeline Assets. Purchaser shall provide Seller with approved copies of the
change of control or assignment documents and other state and federal transfer
documents, as soon as they are available.

 



 

 **Section 7.3** **_Notification of Breaches_**.

 



 

Until the Closing,

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall notify Seller promptly after Purchaser obtains actual
knowledge that any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this
Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material
respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by Seller prior to or on the Closing Date has not been
so performed or observed in any material respect.

 



 

(b) Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly after Seller obtains actual
knowledge that any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material
respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by Purchaser prior to or on the Closing Date has not
been so performed or observed in any material respect.

 



 

(c) If any of Purchasers or Sellers representations or warranties is untrue
or shall become untrue in any material respect between the date of execution
of this Agreement and the Closing Date, or if any of Purchasers or Sellers
covenants or agreements to be performed or observed prior to or on the Closing
Date shall not have been so performed or observed in any material respect, but
such breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall (if
curable) be cured by the Closing (or, if the Closing does not occur, by the
date set forth in **Section 10.1**), then such breach shall be considered not
to have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.4** **_Directors and Officers_**.

 



 

(a) If the Closing occurs, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, use reasonable best efforts to take necessary actions to provide
that all rights to indemnification and all limitations on liability existing
in favor of any current or former officers, directors, partners, members,
managers or employees of any of the Acquired Companies (or their respective
predecessors), as provided in the Organizational Documents of any of the
Acquired Companies in effect on the date hereof, shall survive the Closing and
continue in full force and effect and be honored by the Acquired Companies
after the Closing in accordance with their respective terms.

 



 

(b) In the event that Purchaser, any Acquired Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all its business or assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser
or such Acquired Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations
set forth in this **Section 7.4**.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The obligations of Purchaser or any Acquired Company under this **Section
7.4** shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any indemnitee to whom this **Section 7.4** applies without the
express written consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed
that the indemnitees to whom this **Section 7.4** applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this **Section 7.4**).

 



 

 **Section 7.5** **_Public Announcements_**.

 



 

Until the Closing, neither Party shall make any press release or other public
announcement regarding the existence of this Agreement, the contents hereof or
the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the
other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict
disclosures by Purchaser or Seller which are (a) necessary, upon advice of
counsel, for such disclosing Party to comply with by applicable securities or
other Laws or regulations or the applicable rules of any stock exchange having
jurisdiction over the disclosing Party or its Affiliates or (b) necessary for
a Party to perform this Agreement, including disclosures to Governmental
Bodies, a Partys attorneys, lenders or financial advisors ( _provided_ that
such attorneys, lenders or advisors are obligated to keep such information
confidential), or third parties holding preferential rights to purchase,
rights of consent or other rights that may be applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as reasonably necessary to provide notices,
seek waivers, amendments or termination of such rights, or seek such consents;
and _provided further_ that Purchaser may disclose the existence and contents
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to the Standard and
Poors and Moodys rating agencies ( _provided_ that such agencies are
obligated to keep such information confidential). At or after Closing, the
content of any press release or public announcement shall be subject to the
prior review and reasonable approval of Seller and Purchaser. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Seller acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser is required to
make a public announcement and filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (regarding this Agreement and the Upstream Purchase Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby), including filing said
agreements. Purchaser will provide Seller with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon such public announcement and filing, including all
exhibits thereto (and will consider Sellers reasonable comments timely made
thereto) prior to their release.

 



 

 **Section 7.6** **_Operation of Business_**.

 



 

Except as set forth on **Schedule 7.6**, until the Closing, Seller (a) will
cause the Acquired Companies to operate their business in the ordinary course
consistent with past practices as a reasonably prudent operator, (b) will not,
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, cause the Acquired Companies to
commit to any operation, or series of related operations, reasonably
anticipated by Seller to require future capital expenditures by the Acquired
Companies in excess of $200,000.00, or make any capital expenditures in excess
of $200,000.00, or voluntarily terminate, materially amend or extend any
Material Contract, (c) will (or will cause the Acquired Companies to) maintain
the insurance coverage, if any, presently furnished by nonaffiliated third
parties in the amounts and of the types presently in force, (d) will cause the
Acquired Companies to maintain and comply with all material Governmental
Authorizations, including the Tariff, (e) will cause the Acquired Companies
not to transfer, sell, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any
material Pipeline Assets except for sales and dispositions of Hydrocarbons and
obsolete or worn out equipment made in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices, (f) will promptly give Purchaser notice of any
written notice claiming any default or violation received or given by Seller
under any Contract or Law affecting

 



      
 

 



 

the Acquired Companies or the Pipeline Assets, taken as a whole, that would
reasonably be expected to be material to the Pipeline Assets and (g) will not
(and will cause the Acquired Companies not to) commit to do any of the
foregoing. Purchasers approval of any action restricted by this **Section
7.6** shall be considered granted within ten (10) days (unless a shorter time
is reasonably required by the circumstances and such shorter time is specified
in Sellers written notice) of Sellers notice to Purchaser requesting such
consent unless Purchaser notifies Seller to the contrary in writing during
that period. In the event of an emergency, Seller may take such action as a
prudent operator would take and shall notify Purchaser of such action promptly
thereafter.

 



 

 **Section 7.7** **_Intercompany Accounts_**.

 



 

Prior to the Closing, Seller shall (and shall cause its respective Affiliates,
if applicable, to) cancel and extinguish any and all payables owed by any of
the Acquired Companies to Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than the
Acquired Companies) and any and all receivables owed to any of the Acquired
Companies by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Acquired
Companies), in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP and other than
any payables or receivables, as applicable, accrued in the ordinary course of
business.

 



 

 **Section 7.8** **_Tax Matters_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of **Section 12.3**, Seller shall bear all Non-
Income Taxes and Franchise Taxes attributable to the ownership and operation
of the Acquired Companies or the Pipeline Assets for any period of time prior
to the Effective Time, and Purchaser shall bear all such Taxes attributable to
any period of time at or after the Effective Time. For this purpose, Taxes
based upon gross or net income, sales or receipts shall be apportioned based
upon a closing of the books as of the Effective Time (and Franchise Taxes
shall be determined on a "stand-alone" basis in accordance with the definition
thereof), and all other Taxes shall be apportioned based upon the number of
days in the applicable taxable period either (i) prior to the day that
includes the Effective Time (for purposes of determining Sellers
responsibility) or (ii) on or after the day that includes the Effective Time
(for purposes of determining Purchasers responsibility). To the extent
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies after the
Closing) receives a refund of (or refundable credit against) Taxes for which
Seller is responsible hereunder, other than a refund (or credit) resulting
from a carryback of losses or other items from a period for which Purchaser is
responsible hereunder, Purchaser shall notify and remit to Seller an amount
equal to the amount received or credited promptly upon receipt or credit.

 



 

(b) To the extent the amount taken into account with respect to any Non-Income
Taxes or Franchise Taxes in determining the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant
to **Section** 9.4 differs from the amount of such Taxes ultimately
determined to be due to the relevant Governmental Body, (y) the Party
responsible for such Taxes under this Agreement shall pay any excess of the
amount ultimately determined to be due over the amount taken into account in
determining the Adjusted Purchase Price to the relevant Governmental Body, and
(z) any excess of the amount of such Taxes taken into account in determining
the Adjusted Purchase Price over the amount of such Taxes ultimately
determined to be due to the relevant Governmental Body shall be reimbursed to
the Party responsible for such Taxes under this Agreement by the other Party.
Without duplication of the foregoing, to the extent a Party or any of its
Affiliates (including, with respect to Purchaser, the Acquired Companies after
the Closing) receives a refund of (or a

 



       
 

 



 

refundable credit against) Taxes for which the other Party is responsible
hereunder, other than a refund (or credit) resulting from a carryback or
carryforward of items from a period for which the other Party is responsible
hereunder, the Party receiving (or whose Affiliate receives) such refund or
credit shall notify and remit to the other Party an amount equal to the amount
received or credited promptly upon receipt or credit.

 



 

(c) To the extent Purchaser is required to file a Tax Return (or an amended
Tax Return) on behalf of or with respect to an Acquired Company or the
Pipeline Assets for a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare such Tax Return (or amended Tax
Return) in accordance with past practice (unless otherwise required by
applicable Laws) and shall provide Seller with the right to review and
comment, and shall consider in good faith Sellers comments, on such Tax
Return (or amended Tax Return) prior to filing.

 



 

(d) Each Party agrees to cooperate in good faith, and take such action
reasonably requested by the other Party, to minimize Taxes due from the
Acquired Companies or with respect to the Pipeline Assets or the transactions
contemplated hereunder. Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon
receipt by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies after the Closing) of written notice of any pending or threatened
audit or assessment relating to Taxes for which Seller may be liable pursuant
to this Agreement (collectively, a "Seller Audit") and shall promptly forward
to Seller any written communication received regarding such Seller Audit. To
the extent possible without prejudicing the Parties respective interests, the
Seller Audit shall be severed from any pending or threatened audit or
assessment relating to Taxes for which Purchaser is liable under this
Agreement. If such severance is possible, subject to the other provisions of
this Section 7.8(d), Seller shall have the right to represent the Acquired
Companies with respect to its interests in any Tax audit or administrative or
court proceeding relating to the Seller Audit in cooperation with Purchaser.
If the Seller Audit cannot be severed, Seller shall have the right to appoint
a representative of its interests to cooperate with Purchaser and to be
present at, and participate in, any audit or proceeding regarding the Seller
Audit. In exercising its rights under this Section 7.8, Seller may employ
counsel of Sellers choice at Sellers expense. The Parties agree to
reasonably cooperate in the defense of any Seller Audit and, to the extent
possible, not take actions that would prejudice the rights or obligations of
the other Party. Neither Party nor any of their Affiliates shall be entitled
to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation,
any claim regarding a Seller Audit without the prior written consent of the
other Party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 



 

 **Section 7.9** **_Further Assurances_**.

 



 

After Closing, Seller and Purchaser each agrees to take such further actions
and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further documents as are
reasonably requested by the other Party for carrying out the purposes of this
Agreement or of any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement. From and
after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser and Seller will reasonably
cooperate regarding the Pre-Signing Title Matters as more particularly set
forth on **Schedule 11.7(f)**.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 7.10** **_Access to Financial Information_**.

 



 

(a) Following the date of this Agreement and until the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, Seller agrees to make available to Purchaser, during normal
business hours, any and all existing information and documents in the
possession of Seller (relating to the Acquired Companies or the Pipeline
Assets) or, prior to the Closing only, in the possession of the Acquired
Companies for the period of up to three (3) calendar years prior to the date
of this Agreement through the Closing Date that Purchaser may reasonably
require to comply with tax and financial reporting requirements and audits
that may be required by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Securities Act of 1933 and/or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and

 



 

(b) Following the date of this Agreement and until the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with the independent auditors chosen by Purchaser ("Purchasers
Auditor") in connection with their audit or review of any revenue and expense
statements of the Pipeline Assets that Purchaser or Legacy Reserves LP
requires to comply with their tax and financial reporting requirements and
audits that may be required by the Securities and Exchange Commission under
the Securities Act of 1933 and/or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which
cooperation will include reasonable access during normal business hours to
Sellers employees, representatives and agents who were responsible for
preparing the revenue and expense statements and work papers and other
supporting documents used in the preparation of financial statements, as may
be reasonably required by Purchasers Auditor to perform an audit in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and the delivery of one
or more customary representation letters in substantially the form attached
hereto as **Exhibit F** from Seller to Purchasers Auditor that are requested
by Purchasers Auditor to allow such Auditor to complete an audit (or review
of any interim quarterly financials), and to issue an opinion with respect to
its Audit or review;

 



 

 _provided_ that (i) Purchaser will reimburse Seller, within five (5) Business
Days after demand therefor, for any reasonable out-of-pocket and overhead
costs with respect to any costs incurred by Seller in complying with the
provisions of this **Section 7.10**, (ii) Sellers failure to perform any of
its obligations under this **Section 7.10** shall not delay the Closing
hereunder and Purchaser may not assert that its conditions to Closing under
**Section 8.2** have not been satisfied due to any breach by Seller of any of
its obligations under this **Section 7.10**, (iii) such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Seller or
its Affiliates, (iv) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, agents, consultants or representatives shall have any
liability for any statement, materials or information provided by Seller or
any such Person in connection with this **Section 7.10**, and (v) Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that any financial information provided to Purchaser
pursuant to this **Section 7.10** shall be unaudited at the time it is
provided and that Seller and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to
provide audited financial information pursuant to this **Section 7.10**.

 



 

 **Section 7.11** **_Supplemental Disclosure Schedules_** _._

 



 

(a) Seller shall have the right, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, to amend the Schedules to disclose additional matters that,
had such additional matters existed or occurred on or prior to the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the
Schedules delivered to Purchaser on the date of this Agreement in order to
make Sellers representations and warranties true and correct as

 



      
 

 



 

of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing; _provided, however_ ,
that any such additional matters shall be limited to events or developments
actually occurring after the date of this Agreement ("Disclosed Additional
Matters"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of determining whether
conditions set forth in **Section 8.2** have been fulfilled, any Disclosed
Additional Matters shall be disregarded, and the Schedules shall be deemed to
include only that information contained therein on the date of this Agreement.
If the Closing occurs, all Disclosed Additional Matters will be treated as if
they had been included in the Schedules as of the date of this Agreement for
the purpose of determining whether any Purchaser Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification for breach of a representation and warranty of the Seller
pursuant to **Section 11.4(c)**. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no additional disclosure item with respect to actions taken in
violation of **Section 7.6** shall derogate from the rights of any applicable
Person under **Article 11** or otherwise contemplated hereunder with respect
to such breach of the covenant in **Section 7.6**.

 



 

(b) The Parties agree and acknowledge that **Schedule 5.13(b)** may be
incomplete upon execution of this Agreement or subject to revision prior to
the Closing. Following the date of this Agreement, the Parties shall
reasonably cooperate and communicate to complete or revise **Schedule
5.13(b)**. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, but no
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Purchaser a replacement for **Schedule 5.13(b)** , which shall be
mutually agreed upon by the Parties acting reasonably, without undue condition
or delay. Prior to Closing, Seller will prepare and deliver to Purchaser such
supplemental or corrective assignments as may be reasonably necessary to vest
in the Company all Easements included in the replacement **Schedule 5.13(b)**.

 



 

 **Section 7.12** **_Casualty Loss_** _._

 



 

(a) Subject to **Sections 8.1(i) **and **8.2(i)** , if, after the date of
this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Pipeline
Assets is affected by Casualty Losses or is taken in condemnation or under
right of eminent domain, and the loss as a result of such all such Casualty
Losses or takings exceeds ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price, in the
aggregate, then Seller shall elect by written notice to Purchaser prior to the
Closing either (i) to cause the Pipeline Assets affected by any Casualty Loss
or taking to be repaired or restored to at least its condition prior to such
Casualty Loss, at Sellers sole cost, as promptly as reasonably practicable
(which work may extend after the Closing Date) or (ii) indemnify Purchaser
against all liability, loss, cost and expense incurred by Purchaser to remedy
the Casualty Loss pursuant to an indemnity agreement in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Parties, _provided_ that Seller may not elect
this remedy unless Purchaser has agreed to accept such indemnity agreement. In
each case, Seller shall retain all rights to insurance and other claims
against third parties with respect to the Casualty Loss or taking except to
the extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing.

 



 

(b) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Pipeline Assets is affected by Casualty Losses or is taken in
condemnation or under right of eminent domain, and the loss as a result of
such all such Casualty Losses or takings is less than or equal to ten percent
(10%) of the Purchase Price, in the aggregate, Purchaser shall nevertheless be
required to close and Seller shall, at Closing, pay to Purchaser all sums paid
to Seller by third parties by reason of such Casualty Loss or taking and shall
assign, transfer and set over to Purchaser or

 



      
 

 



 

subrogate Purchaser to all of Sellers right, title and interest (if any) in
insurance claims, unpaid awards, and other rights against third parties (other
than Affiliates of Seller and its and their directors, officers, employees and
agents) arising out of the casualty or taking.

conditions have been satisfied or waived (in each case, excluding any
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions), subject to the
rights of the Parties to terminate this Agreement under **Article 10**.

 



 

(b) The date on which the Closing occurs is herein referred to as the "Closing
Date."

 



 

 **Section 9.2** **_Obligations of Seller at Closing_**.

 



 

At the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser, the
following:

 



 

(a) an assignment agreement, substantially in the form attached as **Exhibit
D**, and such other documentation as is reasonably required to transfer the
Membership Interests to Purchaser, duly executed by Seller;

 



 

(b) a certificate duly executed by an authorized corporate officer of Seller,
dated as of Closing, certifying on behalf of Seller that the conditions set
forth in **Section 8.2(a)** and **Section 8.2(b)** have been fulfilled;

 



 

(c) one (1) original executed statement described in Treasury Regulation
§1.1445-2(b)(2) certifying that Seller is not a foreign Person within the

(d) a resignation letter, executed by each officer, director or manager of any

(e) the Transition Services Agreement, in substantially the form attached

(g) any other documents that the Parties mutually agree are necessary or
desirable to effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 9.3** **_Obligations of Purchaser at Closing_**.

 



 

At the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller, the
following:

 



 

(a) a wire transfer of the Closing Payment to the account designated in
**Section 9.4(c)** in same-day funds;

 



 

(b) an assignment agreement, substantially in the form attached as **Exhibit

(d) the Transition Services Agreement, in substantially the form attached

(e) any other documents that the Parties mutually agree are necessary or

 **Section 9.4** **_Closing Payment and Post-Closing Purchase Price
Adjustments_**.

 



 

(a) Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, based upon the best information
available to Seller, a preliminary settlement statement estimating the
Adjusted Purchase Price after giving effect to all Purchase Price adjustments
provided for in this Agreement. Such estimated Adjusted Purchase Price, less
the Deposit, shall constitute the dollar amount to be paid by Purchaser to
Seller at the Closing (the "Closing Payment"). Purchaser may notify Seller of
disagreements regarding the calculation of the Closing Payment no later than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and the Parties shall in
good faith attempt to resolve any such disagreements without delaying the
Closing. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to reach agreement on all disputed
items prior to the Closing, then the payment due at the Closing shall
nevertheless be based on the calculation of the Closing Payment prepared by
Seller, as adjusted to take into account any items on which the Parties do
reach agreement prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing but not later than
ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver
to Purchaser a statement setting forth the final calculation of the Adjusted
Purchase Price and showing the calculation of each adjustment, based, to the
extent possible, on actual credits, charges, receipts and other items and
taking into account all adjustments provided for in this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, (i) invoices related to the ownership or operation of the
Pipeline Assets between the Effective Time and the Closing and received by
Seller after the Closing shall be paid by Seller and be reflected as an
increase to the final Adjusted Purchase Price, and (ii) cash related to the
ownership or operation of the Pipeline Assets between the Effective Time and
the Closing and received by Seller after the Closing shall be retained by
Seller and reflected as a decrease to the final Adjusted Purchase Price.
Seller shall at Purchasers request supply reasonable documentation available
to support any credit, charge, receipt or other item. As soon as reasonably
practicable but not later than the thirtieth (30th) day following receipt of
Sellers statement hereunder, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a

 



      
 

 



 

written report containing any changes that Purchaser proposes be made to such
statement. The Parties shall undertake to agree on the final statement of the
Adjusted Purchase Price no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the
Closing Date. In the event that the Parties cannot reach agreement within such
period of time, either Party may refer the remaining matters in dispute to a
nationally-recognized independent accounting firm as may be acceptable to
Purchaser and Seller, for review and final determination. The accounting firm
shall conduct the arbitration proceedings in Houston, Texas in accordance with
the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to
the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this **Section 9.4**.
The accounting firms determination shall be made within thirty (30) days
after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding on
both Parties, without right of appeal. In determining the proper amount of any
adjustment to the Purchase Price, the accounting firm shall not increase the
Purchase Price more than the increase proposed by Seller nor decrease the
Purchase Price more than the decrease proposed by Purchaser, as applicable.
The accounting firm shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed matters submitted by either Party and may
not award damages or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter.
Seller and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case. Each Party shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses
of the accounting firm. Within ten (10) Business Days after the date on which
the Parties or the accounting firm, as applicable, finally determines the
disputed matters, (x) Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount by which the
Adjusted Purchase Price (less the Deposit) exceeds the Closing Payment or (y)
Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount by which the Closing Payment exceeds
the Adjusted Purchase Price (less the Deposit), as applicable. Any post-
Closing payment pursuant to this **Section 9.4(b)** shall bear interest at
the Agreed Interest Rate from the Closing Date to the date both Purchaser and
Seller have executed the final settlement statement.

 



 

(c) All payments made or to be made hereunder to Seller shall be by electronic
transfer of immediately available funds to the bank and account specified by
Seller in writing. All payments made or to be made hereunder to Purchaser
shall be by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to a bank and
account specified by Purchaser in writing to Seller.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 10 
TERMINATION**

 



 

 **Section 10.1** **_Termination_**.

 



 

Unless terminated earlier pursuant to other provisions provided herein, this
Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by the mutual prior written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

 



 

(b) by Seller or Purchaser, if Closing has not occurred on or before September
1, 2015 or such later date as mutually agreed;

 



 

(c) by either Party, if under the HSR Act or otherwise, any Governmental Body
shall have commenced or threatened to commence any proceeding to delay or
enjoin the transactions evidenced by this Agreement;

 



      
 

 



 

(d) by Seller, if (i) the conditions set forth in **Section 8.2** have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing and that were, at the time of termination, capable
of being satisfied); (ii) Seller has confirmed in writing that Seller is
ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and (iii) Purchaser shall
have failed for any reason to consummate the Closing by the date the Closing
should have occurred pursuant to **Section 9.1(a)**; or

 



 

(e) by Purchaser, if (i) the conditions set forth in **Section 8.1** have
been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing and that were, at the time of termination,
capable of being satisfied); (ii) Purchaser has confirmed in writing that
Purchaser is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and (iii)
Seller shall have failed for any reason to consummate the Closing by the date
the Closing should have occurred pursuant to **Section 9.1(a)**; or

 



 

(f) by Seller, if the Deposit has not been received in accordance with
**Section 2.4**;

 



 

 _provided, however_ , that no Party shall be entitled to terminate this
Agreement under **Section 10.1** if the Closing has failed to occur because
such Party willfully failed to perform or observe in any material respect its
covenants or agreements hereunder. If this Agreement is not otherwise
terminated pursuant to another provision of this **Section 10.1**, then this
Agreement shall automatically terminate without further action by either Party
upon termination of the Upstream Purchase Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 10.2** **_Effect of Termination_**.

 



 

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to **Section 10.1**, (a) this
Agreement shall become void and of no further force or effect (except for the
provisions of **Sections** **5.6** , **6.5** , **7.1(c), 7.5** ,
**11.4(b)(v)** , **11.8** , **11.9** , **12.7** , **12.13** , **12.17** ,
**12.19** and **12.20** and **Article 10** of this Agreement, and the
confidentiality obligations of **Section** **7.1** , all of which shall
continue in full force and effect), (b) Seller shall be free immediately to
enjoy all rights of ownership of the Pipeline Assets and to sell, transfer,
encumber or otherwise dispose of the Membership Interests to any third party
without any restriction under this Agreement and (c) there will be no
liability or obligation under this Agreement on the part of Seller or
Purchaser, except that nothing in this **Section 10.2** will relieve any
Party from liability for any willful breach of any of its agreements or
covenants contained herein which are to be performed or observed at or prior
to the Closing, except for the obligation of such Party to consummate the
Closing.

 



 

 **Section 10.3** **_Remedies upon Default or Termination_**.

 



 

(a) If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to (i) **Section 10.1(b)**,
if Purchasers breach or failure to perform its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements hereunder, individually or in the aggregate, with all
other breaches and failures to perform that have not been waived in writing,
prevented the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in **Section 8.1** or
(ii) **Section 10.1(d)**, then as Sellers sole and exclusive remedy
hereunder (subject to the following proviso), Seller shall retain the Deposit
as liquidated damages, free of any claims by Purchaser or any other Person
with respect thereto. If Seller is, for any reason, prohibited from retaining
the Deposit as liquidated damages, Seller may then pursue whatever legal or
equitable rights and remedies may be available to Seller, limited to an amount
not exceeding the amount of the Deposit plus reasonable attorneys fees. It is
expressly stipulated by the Parties that the actual amount of damages
resulting from such a termination would be difficult if not impossible

 



      
 

 



 

to determine accurately because of the unique nature of this Agreement, the
unique nature of the Pipeline Assets, the uncertainties of applicable
commodity markets and differences of opinion with respect to such matters, and
that the liquidated damages provided for herein are a reasonable estimate by
the Parties of such damages.

 



 

(b) If Purchaser could terminate this Agreement pursuant to (i) **Section
10.1(b)**, if Sellers breach or failure to perform its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder, individually or in the
aggregate, with all other breaches and failures to perform that have not been
waived in writing, are preventing or have prevented the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in **Section 8.2** or (ii) **Section 10.1(e)**, then
as Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy hereunder, Purchaser, at its option,
may either (x) terminate this Agreement, in which case Seller shall refund to
Purchaser an amount equal to the Deposit, free of any claims by Seller or any
other Person with respect thereto or (y) seek an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement

 



 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than the reasons set
forth in **Section 10.3(a)** or **Section 10.3(b)**, then Seller shall
refund to Purchaser an amount equal to the Deposit, free of any claims by
Seller or any other Person with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser shall not be entitled to receive
interest on the Deposit, whether the Deposit is applied against the Purchase
Price or returned to Purchaser pursuant to this **Section 10.3**.

(d) **_Additional Provisions_**.

 



 

It is the intention of the Parties that this **Article 11** shall govern the
allocation of risks and liabilities between Purchaser and Seller.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, this
**Section 11.4** contains the Parties exclusive remedy against each other
arising under, related to or with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including breaches of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in **Article 4**, **Article
5**, **Article 6** and **Article 7** and the affirmations of such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the
certificate delivered by each Party at Closing pursuant to **Section 9.2(b)**
or **Section 9.3(c)**, as applicable, except for (i) actions for specific
performance or other equitable relief expressly permitted to be sought
pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) the dispute resolution provisions of
**Section 9.4** and (iii) Claims for Property Costs (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, Non-Income Taxes or Franchise Taxes), which shall be
exclusively handled pursuant to the Purchase Price adjustments in **Section
2.2**, and shall not be subject to indemnification under this **Section
11.4**, and no Person will have any other remedy or recourse, whether in
contract or tort or otherwise, it being agreed that all of such other remedies
and recourse are expressly waived and released by the Parties hereto to the
fullest extent permitted by Law.

 



 

In connection with Purchaser Indemnitees access to the Pipeline Assets prior
to the Closing, the Parties acknowledge that such access may be subject to
boarding agreements, releases or other agreements required by Seller. In the
event of a conflict between the provisions of such agreements and **Section
11.4(b)(v)** of this Agreement, **Section 11.4(b)(v)** of this Agreement
shall control.

 



 

 **Section 11.5** **_Indemnification Actions_**.

 



 

All claims for indemnification under **Section 11.4** shall be asserted and
resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) For purposes of this **Article 11**, the term "Indemnifying Party" means
the party or parties having an obligation to indemnify another party or
parties pursuant to the terms of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement. The term "Indemnified Party" means the party or parties having the
right to be indemnified by another party or parties pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) To make a claim for indemnification ("Indemnity Claim") under **Section
11.4**, and/or any other Article (or part thereof) expressly stating that it
controls over the terms of this **Article 11**, an Indemnified Party shall
notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of its Indemnity Claim, including the
specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its Indemnity
Claim (the "Claim Notice"). The Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim
Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Claim
for which it seeks indemnification and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if
any) served with respect to the Claim; _provided_ that the failure of any
Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim as provided in this **Section
11.5** shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under
**Section 11.4** except to the extent such failure results in insufficient
time being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend
against the Claim or otherwise prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to
defend against the Claim. In the event that the Indemnity Claim is based upon
an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement,
the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement which was inaccurate or breached.

 



 

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party against the relevant Claim at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is
authorized, prior to and during such 30-day period, to file any motion, answer
or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to
the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability to indemnify the
Indemnified Party, it shall have the right and obligation to diligently
defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall
have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Party
elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control,
any defense or settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this **Section 11.5(d)**. An Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which does not
include an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from all
liability in respect of such Claim, or (ii) settle any Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect thereto in any manner that may materially
and adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money
damages covered by the indemnity).

 



 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability to indemnify the
Indemnified Party or admits its liability but fails to diligently prosecute or
settle the Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend
against the Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with
counsel of the Indemnified Partys choosing, subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the defense of the Claim
at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its liability for a Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any
proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten
(10) Business Days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in

 



      
 

 



 

writing its liability to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the
Claim and (ii) if liability is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable
judgment, the proposed settlement.

 



 

(f) With respect to Easement Claims for which Purchaser is entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement, in addition to the rights and
obligations set forth in this **Section 11.5**, Seller shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to attempt at its sole cost, to cure or mitigate the
matters giving rise to such Easement Claim, which cure or mitigation would be
accepted by a reasonably prudent purchaser engaged in the business of owning
and operating assets similar to the Acquired Companies and the Pipeline
Assets. In lieu of (or, in the event of any partial cure, in addition to) such
curative actions, Seller shall have the obligation to indemnify Purchaser
against all liability, loss, cost and expense resulting from such Easement
Claim pursuant to this **Section 11.5 **or pursuant to a separate indemnity
agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Parties.

 



 

 **Section 11.6** **_Release_**.

 



 

(a) EXCEPT FOR THE REMEDIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, PURCHASER RELEASES,
REMISES AND FOREVER DISCHARGES SELLER INDEMNITEES FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS,
KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR ARISING IN THE FUTURE, CONTINGENT OR
OTHERWISE, IN CONTRACT AND IN TORT, WHICH PURCHASER MIGHT NOW OR SUBSEQUENTLY
MAY HAVE AGAINST SELLER INDEMNITEES, RELATING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO THE
ASSETS, INCLUDING CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR INCIDENT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS,
ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, THE RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS OR NORM INTO THE
ENVIRONMENT OR PROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH, SAFETY, NATURAL RESOURCES OR THE
ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING RIGHTS TO CONTRIBUTION UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE
ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION, AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980, AS AMENDED,
REGARDLESS OF FAULT.

 



 

(b) Purchaser covenants and agrees that it will not attempt to avoid the
effect of the release made by it hereinabove by later arguing that at the time
of the release it did not fully appreciate the extent of any such Claims,
including Claims arising under Environmental Laws.

 



 

 **Section 11.7** **_Limitation on Actions_**.

 



 

(a) The representations and warranties of the Parties in **Articles 4**, 5
and 6 and the corresponding representations and warranties given in the
certificates delivered at the Closing pursuant to **Section 9.2(b)** and
**Section 9.3(c)**, as applicable, shall survive the Closing for a period of
twelve (12) months, except that (i) the representations and warranties in
**Sections 5.8** and **5.17** shall survive the Closing until the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations. The remainder of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements provided for in this
Agreement shall not survive Closing except that covenants and agreements
contemplated to be complied with or performed following the Closing shall
survive indefinitely. Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
shall be of no further force and effect after the date of their expiration,
_provided_ that there shall be no termination of any bona fide Claim asserted
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the breach of such a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on or before its expiration
date.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The indemnities in **Sections** **11.4(b)(iii)** , **11.4(b)(iv)** ,
**11.4(c)(ii)** and **11.4(c)(iii)** shall terminate as of the termination
date of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that
is subject to indemnification, except in each case as to Claims asserted
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the breach of such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on or before such termination date.
Purchasers indemnities in **Sections** **11.4(b)(i)** , **11.4(b)(ii)** ,
and **11.4(b)(v)** and Sellers indemnity in **Section 11.4(c)(i)** shall
continue without time limit.

 



 

(c) Seller shall not have any liability for any indemnification under
**Section 11.4(c)(ii)** or **Section 11.4(c)(iii)** until and unless the
amount of an individual Claim exceeds $100,000.00 (the "Threshold").

 



 

(d) Seller shall not have any liability for any indemnification under
**Section 11.4(c)(ii)** or **Section 11.4(c)(iii)** until and unless the
aggregate amount of the liability for all Claims exceeding the Threshold
exceeds $1,000,000.00 (the "First Deductible"), at which point Seller shall be
liable only for indemnification under **Section 11.4(c)(iii)** to the extent
relating to an inaccuracy or breach of the representations or warranties in
**Section 5.13(b)** or **Section 5.13(d)** ("Easement Claims") and then only
to the extent the amount of such Easement Claims exceeds the First Deductible.
With respect to all other claims for indemnification under **Section
11.4(c)(ii)**or **Section 11.4(c)(iii)**, Seller shall not have any liability
until and unless the aggregate amount of the liability for all Claims
exceeding the Threshold, including all Claims counted toward the First
Deductible, exceeds one and one half percent (1.5%) of the Purchase Price (the
"Second Deductible"), and then only to the extent the amount of all such
Claims exceeds the Second Deductible. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) this
**clause (d)** shall not apply to liability for breaches of the covenant in
**Section 7.8** and (ii) the adjustments to the Purchase Price under
**Section 2.2** and any payments in respect thereof shall not be limited by
this Section.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement, Seller shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser under this
**Article 11** for aggregate damages in excess of an amount equal to fifteen
percent (15%) of the Purchase Price; _provided, however_ , that this **clause
(e)** shall not apply to liability for breaches of the covenant in **Section
7.8**.

 



 

(f) For the purposes of determining whether a breach of the representations
and warranties set forth in **Section 5.13(d) **occurred for which an
Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnity under this **Article 11**, and
the amount of Claims resulting from any such breach, the representations and
warranties set forth in **Section 5.13(d)** shall be read as though they were
not qualified to the knowledge of Seller. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser shall not be entitled to seek
indemnification hereunder with respect to any matters relating to or arising
out of the Pre-Signing Title Matters.

 



 

(g) The amount of any Claims for which Purchaser Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnity under this **Article 11** as a result of a breach of any of the
representations contained in **Section** 5.8 shall be reduced so as not to
take into account any Taxes for which Purchaser is responsible under **Section
7.8** or to the extent the breach otherwise results in benefits to Purchaser
or its Affiliates.

 



 

(h) The amount of any Claims for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnity under this **Article 11** shall be reduced by the amount of
insurance proceeds or Tax benefits, if

 



      
 

 



 

any, realized by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates (or direct or
indirect owners) with respect to such Claims, net of any collection costs and
excluding the proceeds of any insurance policy issued or underwritten by the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates.

 



 

(i) Purchaser shall not be entitled to indemnification or any other remedy
under this Agreement with respect to any Claims to the extent attributable to
or arising out of the actions of Purchaser after Closing as owner of the
Membership Interests or as owner and operator of any of the Pipeline Assets.

 



 

(j) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event will the
Seller Indemnitees or the Purchaser Indemnitees be entitled to duplicate
recovery under this **Article 11** with respect to (i) any Claim, even though
the facts or series of related facts giving rise to such Claim may constitute
a breach of more than one representation, warranty or covenant or agreement
set forth herein or in any document delivered in connection with the Closing
or (ii) any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to **Section 2.2**.

 



 

(k) Neither Party shall have any liability as to the other Party, and each
expressly waives any claim for, punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative
damages or damages that are not the natural, probable and reasonably
foreseeable result of a breach of this Agreement, including damages arising
from the special circumstances of the Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller
Indemnitee, as applicable, whether or not such special circumstances were
communicated to the Parties at the time this Agreement was executed, except to
the extent such damages are recovered by an unaffiliated third Person against
such Party in a third Person Claim for which such Party would otherwise be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this **Article 11**.

 **Section 11.9** **_Waiver of Trade Practices Acts_**.

 



 

(a) It is the intention of the Parties that Purchasers rights and remedies
with respect to this transaction and with respect to all acts or practices of
Seller, past, present or future, in connection with this transaction shall be
governed by legal principles other than the Texas Deceptive Trade
PracticesConsumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. and Com. Code Ann. § 17.41 _et
seq. _(the "DTPA"). As such, Purchaser hereby waives the applicability of the
DTPA to this transaction and any and all duties, rights or remedies that might
be imposed by the DTPA, whether such duties, rights and remedies are applied
directly by the DTPA itself or indirectly in connection with other statutes;
_provided_ , _however_ , Purchaser does not waive § 17.555 of the DTPA.
Purchaser acknowledges, represents and warrants that it is purchasing the
goods and/or services covered by this Agreement for commercial or business
use; that it has assets of $5 million or more according to its most recent
financial statement prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles; that it has knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters that enable it to evaluate the merits and risks of a transaction such
as this; and that it is not in a significantly disparate bargaining position
with Seller.

to perform its obligations under this Agreement has been predicated upon the
inapplicability of the DTPA and this waiver of the DTPA. Purchaser further
recognizes that Seller, in determining to proceed with the entering into of
this Agreement, has expressly relied on this waiver and the inapplicability of
the DTPA.

be bound until such time as all of the Parties have executed counterparts of
this Agreement.

exemption, Seller will cooperate with Purchaser in obtaining such certificate
or evidence and as otherwise reasonably requested by Purchaser to minimize the
imposition of such Transfer and Recording Taxes.

As promptly as practicable, but in any case within ninety (90) days after the

grace period for eliminating existing usage, shall have no right to use any
logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

 **Section 12.6** **_Replacement of Bonds, Letters of Credit and
Guarantees_**.

 



 

The Parties understand that none of the bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees, if any, posted by Seller with Governmental Bodies and relating to
the Acquired Companies or the Pipeline Assets may be transferable to
Purchaser. Promptly following Closing, Purchaser shall obtain, or cause to be
obtained in the name of Purchaser, replacements for such bonds, letters of
credit and guarantees, to the extent such replacements are necessary to permit
the cancellation of the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees posted by
Seller or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

 



 

EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY UNCONDITIONALLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH.
EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH

 **Section 12.15** **_Construction_**.

 



 

Purchaser is a Party capable of making such investigation, inspection, review
and evaluation of the Membership Interests and the Pipeline Assets as a
prudent purchaser would deem appropriate under the circumstances including
with respect to all matters relating to the Membership Interests and the
Pipeline Assets and their value, operation and suitability. Each of Seller and
Purchaser has had substantial input into the drafting and preparation of this
Agreement and has had the opportunity to exercise business discretion in
relation to the negotiation of the details of the transactions contemplated

contemplated hereby is not affected in a materially adverse manner with
respect to either Party.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 12.18** **_Time of Essence_**.

 



 

Time is of the essence in this Agreement. If the date specified in this
Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action is not a Business Day (or
if the period during which any notice is required to be given or any action

during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall be the next
day which is a Business Day.

 



 

 **Section 12.19** **_Equitable Remedies_**.

 



 

(a) Each Party acknowledges that its obligations hereunder are unique and that
remedies at law, including monetary damages, will be inadequate in the event
it should default in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.
Accordingly, in the event of any breach (i) by Purchaser, prior to the
Closing, of **Section 7.2** or **Section 7.5** or of the Confidentiality
Agreement or, following the Closing, of any agreement or covenant set forth in
this Agreement to be performed after the Closing; or (ii) by Seller, prior to
the Closing, of **Section 7.1**, **Section 7.2 **or **Section 7.5** or of
the Confidentiality Agreement or, following the Closing, of any agreement or
covenant set forth in this Agreement to be performed after the Closing, the
other Party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, without the proof of
actual damages, including in the form of an injunction or injunctions or
temporary orders for specific performance to prevent such breaches of this
Agreement and to order the defaulting Party to affirmatively carry out such
obligations under this Agreement, and each Party hereby waives any defense to
the effect that a remedy at law would be an adequate remedy for such breach.
Such equitable relief shall be in addition to any other remedy to which each
Party is entitled to at law or in equity as a remedy for such nonperformance,
breach or threatened breach and shall in no way serve to limit a Partys
rights under **Article 10**. Each Party hereby waives any requirements for
the securing or posting of any bond with such equitable remedy. The foregoing
shall not be deemed to be or construed as a waiver or election of remedies by
either Party, each of whom expressly reserves any and all rights and remedies
available to it at law or in equity in the event of any such breach or default
by the other Party under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the right of Seller generally to seek equitable relief as
described in **Section 12.19(a)**, Seller may not seek any type of equitable
relief to cause the Closing to be consummated and the Purchase Price to be
paid.

 



 

 **Section 12.20** **_Non-Recourse_**

 



 

This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim, action, suit or
other legal proceeding (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) based
upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the
entities that are expressly named as parties hereto. No Person who is not a
named party to this Agreement, including any past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, equity holder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any named party to this
Agreement ("Non-Party Affiliates"), shall have any liability (whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, or based upon any theory that seeks to
impose liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for any
obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation or execution, and each Party

 



      
 

 



 

waives and releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations against any
such Non-Party Affiliates. Non-Party Affiliates are expressly intended as
third-party beneficiaries of this provision of this Agreement.
