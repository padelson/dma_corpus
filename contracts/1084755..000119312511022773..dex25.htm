substantially in the form of _Exhibit C_ hereto. Pursuant to the terms of the

SECTION 2.03 _Working Capital Adjustment_. 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall in good faith and with the
assistance of its independent auditor prepare an estimated consolidated
balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing
Date Balance Sheet_ ") The Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP (as defined in Section 3.08(a))
consistently applied, to the extent applicable, and with the same assumptions,
estimates and methodologies used by the Company in preparing the consolidated
balance sheet 

 



7  of the Company as of December 31, 2009 as required by Section 3.08, which
assumptions, estimates and methodologies shall be set forth on Exhibit D
attached hereto (collectively, the " _Accounting Assumptions, Estimates and
Methodologies_ "). The assets on the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet
shall be reduced by the book value of any assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately before the Closing that are not the assets of QIL,
Quadrem and its Subsidiaries, or the Brazilian Stock and Nominal Stock
immediately after Closing, and the liabilities on the Estimated Closing Date
Balance Sheet shall be reduced by the book value of any Liabilities of
the Company and its Subsidiaries that are not Liabilities of QIL, Quadrem and
its Subsidiaries or the Brazilian Stock and Nominal Stock immediately after
Closing (collectively, the _"Quadrem Balance Sheet Adjustments"_ ). _Exhibit
D_  shall list each excluded asset and liability included in the Quadrem
Balance Sheet Adjustments, and the book value of each such asset and
liability, based on the Reference Balance Sheet as if the Closing occurred on
the date of the Reference Balance Sheet. The Company shall in good faith
prepare an estimate of the working capital of the Company as of the Closing
Date (the " _Estimated Closing Date Working Capital_ ") based on the Estimated
Closing Date Balance Sheet, as adjusted by the Quadrem Balance Sheet
Adjustments. The Estimated Closing Date Working Capital shall be calculated in
a manner consistent with the calculation of, and based on the Accounting
Assumptions, Estimates and Methodologies; provided that such working capital
calculation shall contain no accrued liabilities for Terminated Agreement
Liabilities. Not later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing, the
Company shall deliver to Buyer the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and
the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital, together with worksheets and data
that support the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Estimated
Closing Date Working Capital calculation. If Buyer in good faith disagrees
with the calculation of Estimated Closing Date Working Capital, it shall
notify the Company not later than two (2) business days before the Closing
Date and, if the parties are unable to resolve their differences regarding
such calculation, the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital shall be the
amounts calculated by the Company if such amounts are certified by its
independent auditor, otherwise the amounts calculated in good faith by the
Buyer. As provided in Section 2.01(a) hereof, the Base Consideration to be
paid at the Closing shall be adjusted:

(i) either (A) dollar-for-dollar up to the extent that the Estimated Closing
Date Working Capital is more than the working capital of the Company as of
December 31, 2009, as set forth on _Exhibit D_ , or (B) dollar-for-dollar down
to the extent that the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital is less than
the working capital of the Company as of December 31, 2009, as set forth on
_Exhibit D_ (such adjustment resulting from this clause (i) being the "
_Estimated Closing Working Capital Adjustment_ "),  _provided_ that no such
adjustment shall be made if the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment is less
than one million dollars (US$1,000,000).

(b) As soon as practical after the Closing, but no later than ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare in good faith a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing (the " _Post-Closing Date
Balance Sheet_ "). The Post-Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP (as defined in Section 3.08(a)) consistently
applied, to the extent applicable, and with the Accounting Assumptions,
Estimates and Methodologies. The Post-Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be
adjusted by the Quadrem Balance Sheet Adjustments. Buyer shall prepare in good
faith within such ninety (90) day period the working capital of the Company
as of the Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing Date Working_

 



8   _Capital_ ") based on the Post-Closing Date Balance Sheet, as adjusted by
the Quadrem Balance Sheet Adjustments. The Post-Closing Date Working Capital
shall be calculated in a manner consistent with the calculation of, and based
on the Accounting Assumptions, Estimates, and Methodologies used in
calculating the working capital of the Company as of December 31, 2009 set
forth on _Exhibit D_ , which exhibit shall also set forth the material
assumptions, estimates and methodologies used in such calculation; provided
that such working capital calculations shall contain no accrued liabilities
for Terminated Agreement Liabilities. During this ninety (90) day period, the
Company shall provide Buyer access to all of the Companys books and records
during normal business hours to the extent reasonably necessary to allow Buyer
to prepare such balance sheet and calculate such working capital. Buyer
shall, within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date, deliver the Post-Closing
Date Balance Sheet and Post-Closing Date Working Capital to the Company,
together with worksheets and data that support the Post-Closing Date Balance
Sheet and any other information that the Company may reasonably request to
verify the amounts reflected on the Post-Closing Date Balance Sheet and Post-
Closing Date Working Capital. If the Company disagrees with the Post-Closing
Date Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Post-Closing Date Working
Capital set forth therein, it shall notify Buyer of such disagreement in
writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such
disagreement (the " _Seller Dispute Notice_ "), within thirty (30) days of
its receipt of the Post-Closing Balance Sheet. In the event that the Company
does not provide a Seller Dispute Notice within such thirty (30) day period,
the Company shall be deemed to have accepted the Post-Closing Balance Sheet
and the calculations of the Post-Closing Date Working Capital by Buyer, which
deemed acceptance shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes
hereunder. In the event any such notice of disagreement is timely provided,
Buyer and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period
of thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to
resolve any disagreements with respect to Buyers calculation of the Post-
Closing Date Working Capital. If, at the end of such period, they are unable
to resolve any such disagreements, then an independent accounting firm of
recognized national standing as may be mutually selected by Buyer and the
Company (the " _Auditor_ ") shall resolve any remaining disagreements. If
Buyer and the Company do not agree on the Auditor within thirty (30) days, the
Auditor shall be the New York City office of PricewaterhouseCoopers. The
Auditor shall determine as promptly as practicable, but in any event within
thirty (30) days of the date on which such dispute is referred to the Auditor,
whether and to what extent (if any) Buyers calculation of the Post-Closing
Date Working Capital requires adjustment. The fees and expenses of the
Auditor shall be paid by the Company, unless the Auditor determines that the
Post-Closing Date Working Capital calculated by Buyer underestimated the Post-
Closing Date Working Capital determined by the Auditor by more than seventeen
and one-half percent (17.5%), in which event the costs and expenses of the
Auditor shall be split equally between the Buyer and the Company. The
determinations of the Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties. The final amount of the Post-Closing Date Working Capital as
determined pursuant to this Section 2.03(b) is referred to as the " _Final
Closing Date Working Capital Amount_."

 

(c) To the extent the Final Closing Date Working Capital Amount is (i) larger
than the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital, then Buyer shall promptly
pay cash to the Company or (ii) smaller than the Estimated Closing Date
Working Capital, then the Escrow Agent shall promptly pay cash out of the
Escrow Fund to Buyer, in either case such that the adjustment to the Base
Consideration, after giving effect to such payment, is the same adjustment

 



9  that would have been made at Closing pursuant to Section 2.03(a) if the
Estimated Closing Date Working Capital had equaled the Final Closing Date
Working Capital, with no adjustment being made to the Base Consideration for
an amount less than one million dollars (US$1,000,000).

SECTION 2.04 _Holdback_. 

(a) Buyers obligation to deliver to the Company the Holdback Consideration is
contingent upon the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions (the " _Use
Condition_ ") including the obligation of each party to an Amended Customer
Agreement during the Holdback Period, subject to certain terms and conditions,
(i) make specified cash payments to Buyer and (ii) use the Quadrem Network to
facilitate all purchasing and invoicing activities with respect to specified
Sell-Side Customers at specified business and/or operating units , as further
defined in the holdback release agreement between the Buyer and the Seller
and acknowledged by each Specified Customer (the " _Holdback Release
Agreement_ ") dated the date hereof.

 

(b) Any disputes arising in connection with the Holdback and/or Use Condition
shall be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution mechanism set
forth in Section 9.07 hereof.

SECTION 2.05 _Distributions by the Company_. The Company shall not make any
distribution of any part of the Total Consideration to: (i) a Company
Stockholder unless such Company Stockholder has executed and delivered the
Stockholder Agreement; (ii) an Entitled Optionee listed on Schedule 2.05
(each, a " _Major Entitled Optionee_ ") unless such Major Entitled Optionee
has executed and delivered a Major Entitled Optionee Agreement in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ ; and (iii) an Entitled Optionee who is not a
Major Entitled Optionee unless such other Entitled Optionee has executed and
delivered an Entitled Optionee Agreement in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit F_.

SECTION 2.06 _Terminated Agreement Liabilities_.

(a) If before Closing either (i) any Terminated Agreement is terminated by
any party thereto or (ii) any such party notifies the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of its intent to terminate such Terminated Agreement on or after
Closing, then not later than five (5) business days before the Closing Date,
the Company shall in good faith prepare an estimate of the Terminated
Agreement Liabilities that have or are more likely than not to arise as a
result of terminating the Terminated Agreements pursuant to Section 6.12. If
Buyer in good faith disagrees with such estimate of the Terminated Agreement
Liabilities, it shall notify the Company not later than two (2) business days
before the Closing Date and, if the parties are unable to resolve their
differences regarding such estimate, the estimated amount of the Terminated
Agreement Liabilities shall equal the sum of the Companys estimate and the
Buyers estimate divided by two. The estimated amount of the Terminated
Agreement Liabilities as determined pursuant to this Section 2.06(a) is
referred to as the " _Estimated Terminated Agreement Liabilities Amount_."

 

(b) If at any time after Closing and before the thirty (30) month anniversary
of the Closing, the actual cumulative Terminated Agreement Liabilities exceed
the Estimated Terminated Agreement Liabilities, Buyer shall prepare in good
faith a report (the " _Terminated_

 



10   _Agreement Liabilities Report_ "), which report shall reflect Buyers
calculation of such actual cumulative Terminated Agreement Liabilities,
including (i) a reasonably detailed break down of all fees, costs and
expenses used to determine such actual cumulative Terminated Agreement
Liabilities and (ii) the excess of such amount over the sum of (A) the
Estimated Terminated Agreement Liabilities and (B) the cumulative amount
previously paid by the Escrow Agent to Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.06(b).
If the Company disagrees with the calculation of such actual cumulative
Terminated Agreement Liabilities or such excess amount set forth in the
Terminated Agreement Liabilities Report, it shall notify Buyer of such
disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of
such disagreement within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the
Terminated Agreement Liabilities Report. In the event any such notice is not
provided within such thirty (30) day period, the Seller shall be deemed to
have accepted Buyers calculation, which acceptance shall be final, conclusive
and binding on Seller. In the event any such notice of disagreement is timely
provided, Buyer and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts for
a period of thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may mutually
agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect to Buyers calculation of
the final Terminated Agreement Liabilities. If, at the end of such period,
they are unable to resolve any such disagreements, then an Auditor shall be
selected in the same manner as set forth in Section 2.03(b). The Auditor
shall determine as promptly as practicable, but in any event within thirty
(30) days of the date on which such dispute is referred to the Auditor,
whether and to what extent (if any) Buyers calculation of such excess amount
requires adjustment. The fees and expenses of the Auditor shall be promptly
paid by the Escrow Agent in cash out of the Escrow Fund, unless the Auditor
determines that such excess amount, as calculated by Buyer, overstated
such excess amount, as determined by the Auditor, by more than seventeen and
one-half percent (17.5%), in which event the costs and expenses of the Auditor
shall be split equally between the Buyer and the Escrow Agent. The
determinations of the Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties. If such excess amount, as deemed to be accepted by the Seller or as
determined by the Auditor, as the case may be, is greater than zero, then the
Escrow Agent shall promptly pay cash out of the Escrow Fund to Buyer equal to
such excess amount.

(c) Within ten (10) days after the thirty (30) month anniversary of the
Closing, Buyer shall prepare in good faith a final report (the " _Final
Terminated Agreement Liabilities Report_ "), which report shall reflect
Buyers calculation of the final actual cumulative Terminated Agreement
Liabilities (the " _Final Terminated Agreement Liabilities Amount_ "),
including a reasonably detailed break down of all fees, costs and expenses
used to determine the Final Terminated Agreement Liabilities Amount. If the
Company disagrees with the calculation of the Final Terminated Agreement
Liabilities Amount, it shall notify Buyer of such disagreement in writing,
setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement within
thirty (30) days of its receipt of the Final Terminated Agreement Liabilities
Report. In the event any such notice is not provided within such thirty (30)
day period, the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted Buyers calculation,
which acceptance shall be final, conclusive and binding on Seller. In the
event any such notice of disagreement is timely provided, Buyer and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of thirty (30)
days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any
disagreements with respect to Buyers calculation of the Final Terminated
Agreement Liabilities Amount. If, at the end of such period, they are unable
to resolve any such disagreements, then an Auditor shall be selected in the
same manner as set forth in Section 2.03(b). The Auditor shall determine as
promptly as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days of the date
on which such dispute is referred to the 

 



11  Auditor, whether and to what extent (if any) Buyers calculation of the
Final Terminated Agreement Liabilities Amount requires adjustment. The fees
and expenses of the Auditor shall be promptly paid by the Escrow Agent in
cash out of the Escrow Fund, unless the Auditor determines that the Final
Terminated Agreement Liabilities Amount, as calculated by Buyer, overstated
such amount, as determined by the Auditor, by more than seventeen and one-
half percent (17.5%), in which event the costs and expenses of the Auditor
shall be split equally between the Buyer and the Escrow Agent. The
determinations of the Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties. To the extent that the sum of (i) the Estimated Terminated Agreement
Liabilities Amount and (ii) the aggregate amount paid by the Escrow Agent to
Buyer pursuant to Section 2.06(b) is (A) larger than the Final Terminated
Agreement Liabilities Amount as deemed to be accepted by Seller or as
determined by the Auditor, as the case may be, then Buyer shall promptly pay
cash to the Company equal to the amount of such difference or (ii) smaller
than the Final Terminated Agreement Liabilities Amount, then the Escrow Agent
shall promptly pay cash out of the Escrow Fund to Buyer equal to the amount of
such difference.

The Seller hereby represents and warrants to Buyer that the statements
contained in this Article III are true and correct as of the date of this

delivered by the Company to Buyer concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement and, with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.19(a), except as otherwise provided in Section 3.19(c) (the "
_Seller Disclosure Schedule_ "). The Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be
arranged according to specific sections in this Article III and shall provide
exceptions to, or otherwise qualify in reasonable detail, the corresponding

hold and operate its properties and other assets and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted and as currently proposed to be conducted, except
where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have
such corporate power and authority has not had, and could not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Quadrem Material

foreign entity to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction
where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the

12  property or has employees or engages independent contractors. The term "

aggregate, (A) materially adverse to the business, operations, condition
(financial or otherwise), assets (tangible or intangible), liabilities,
employees, properties, prospects, capitalization or results of operations
of the Quadrem Group and the Quadrem Subsidiaries taken as a whole, except
for any such events, changes, violations, inaccuracies, circumstances or
effects resulting from or arising in connection with (i) any changes in
general economic or business conditions that do not disproportionately impact
the Quadrem Group and the Quadrem Subsidiaries taken as a whole; (ii) any
changes or events affecting the industry in which the Quadrem Group and the
Quadrem Subsidiaries operate that do not disproportionately impact the
Quadrem Group and the Quadrem Subsidiaries taken as a whole (it being
understood that in any controversy concerning the applicability of the
preceding exceptions, the Seller shall have the burden of proof with respect
to the elements of such exceptions); (iii) any event or circumstance resulting
from or attributable to the execution or announcement of this Agreement or the
pendency of the transactions contemplated hereby or by Acquisition
Documents; or (iv) any changes made by the Quadrem Group in its business
operations or other actions taken, delayed or omitted to be taken by the
Quadrem Group, in each case, at the written request or with the written

the same. For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Organizational Documents_ "
means, with respect to any person, the organizational or charter documents of
such person, including, without limitation, the certificate of incorporation,
memorandum of association and byelaws, as applicable, of such person.

 

SECTION 3.03 _Quadrem Subsidiaries_.

(a) Section 3.03(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth: (i) the name
of each corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or
other entity in which the Quadrem Group has, directly or indirectly, an

Each Quadrem Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to conduct business and
is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the nature
of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties requires such

licensed or in good standing has not had, and could not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Quadrem Material Adverse Effect.
Each Quadrem Subsidiary has all requisite power and authority to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted and as currently proposed to be
conducted and to own, lease and otherwise use the assets and properties owned

each Quadrem Subsidiary are held of record or owned beneficially by either
the Quadrem Group or another Quadrem Subsidiary and are held or owned free and
clear of any restriction on transfer (other than restrictions under applicable
securities Laws), claim, security interest, option, warrant, right, lien,
call, commitment, equity or demand. There are no outstanding or authorized

investment in (whether in the form of a loan, capital contribution
or otherwise), any person other than a Quadrem Subsidiary.

SECTION 3.04 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized share capital of QIL consists of 12,000 common shares of

Law. None of the Seller, the Quadrem Group, or any Quadrem Subsidiary has
received any notice regarding a violation of, conflict with, or failure to

SECTION 3.08 _Financial Statements_. 

(a) _Financial Statements of Company_. True and complete copies of (i) the
audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2009, and the related audited consolidated statements of
operations, changes in stockholders

 



17  equity and changes in cash flows for the year then ended, together with all
related notes and schedules thereto (the " _2009 Financial Statements_ "), and
(ii) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2010 (the " _Reference Balance Sheet_ "), and
the related unaudited statements of operations, changes in stockholders
equity and changes in cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2010
(collectively referred to herein as the " _Interim Financial Statements_ "),
are attached as Section 3.08(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. The 2009
Financial Statements and the Interim Financial Statements (including, in each
case, any notes thereto) were prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (" _U.S. GAAP_ ") applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by
U.S. GAAP) and each present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the respective
dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein, except as
otherwise noted therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal and recurring year-end adjustments which were not and are not
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to be material). A true and
correct copy of the Quadrem Balance Sheet Adjustments, assuming for purposes
of this Section 3.08 that such adjustments are calculated based on the
Reference Balance Sheet as if the Closing occurs as of the date of the
Reference Balance Sheet rather than the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet is
attached as Section 3.08(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Such
adjustments have been calculated in accordance with the assumptions,
estimates and methodologies set forth on _Exhibit D_.

(b) The Company and the Subsidiaries do not have any debts, liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether known or unknown, accrued or fixed,
absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, determined or determinable, or
as a guarantor or otherwise) (" _Liabilities_ "), other than Liabilities (i)
recorded or reserved against on the Reference Balance Sheet; (ii) as described
in the notes to Quadrems audited financial statements; (iii) incurred since
the date of the Reference Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of the
business, consistent with past practice; (iv) future performance obligations
under a Material Contract and any other contracts with future aggregate
payments less than US$100,000 in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice (but not any Liabilities resulting from the breach or

applicable Laws in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice (but not any Liabilities resulting from the failure to comply or
alleged failure to comply with applicable Laws). Except as set forth in
Section 3.08(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding
warranty claims against Quadrem.

(c) Except as set forth on Section 3.08(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
the Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions to which the Quadrem Group
or any Quadrem Subsidiary are a party are executed in accordance with
managements general or specific authorizations, (ii) such transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with U.S. GAAP and to maintain asset accountability, and (iii) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. The Seller has made available to Buyer complete and correct
copies of, all written descriptions of, and all policies, manuals and other
documents promulgating such internal accounting controls.

 



18 (d) No written complaint, allegation, assertion or claim has been made to the
Company regarding the inadequacy of the Company system of internal financial
controls or the accuracy of the 2009 Financial Statements or the Interim
Financial Statements, and there have been no instances of intentional fraud,
whether or not material, during any period covered by the 2009 Financial
Statements or the Interim Financial Statements.

SECTION 3.09  _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since September 30,
2010, except as contemplated by or as disclosed in this Agreement, the Quadrem
Group and all of the Quadrem Subsidiaries have conducted business only in the
ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practice and, since such
date, there has not been any Quadrem Material Adverse Effect. From September
30, 2010 until the date hereof, the Quadrem Group and Quadrem Subsidiaries
have not taken or legally committed to take any of the actions specified in
Sections 5.01(a) through 5.01(bb) that would have required Buyers consent
thereto had such provisions been in effect during such period.

 

SECTION 3.10 _Absence of Litigation_. There is no litigation, suit, claim,
action, Proceeding, or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the
Seller, threatened against the Seller, the Quadrem Group or any Quadrem
Subsidiary, any Contributed Asset or any property or asset owned or used by
the Quadrem Group or any Quadrem Subsidiary or any person whose liability
the Quadrem Group has or may have assumed, either contractually or by
operation of applicable Law, before any arbitrator or Governmental Entity.
None of the Seller, the Quadrem Group, any Quadrem Subsidiary, the officers or
directors of the Seller, the Quadrem Group or any Quadrem Subsidiary in their
capacity as such, or any property or asset of the Seller, the Quadrem Group or
any Quadrem Subsidiary is subject to any continuing order, consent decree,
settlement agreement or other similar written agreement with, or, to the
knowledge of the Seller, continuing investigation by, any Governmental Entity,
or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or unsatisfied
award of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Entity. To the knowledge of
the Seller, no director or officer of the Seller, the Quadrem Group or any
Quadrem Subsidiary is a party to any current Proceeding, in their capacity as
a director or officer of the Seller, the Quadrem Group or any Quadrem
Subsidiary. As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Seller, the Quadrem

any third party.

Group or any Quadrem Subsidiary or (ii) each employee benefit plan for which
the Seller, the Quadrem Group or any Quadrem Subsidiary could incur liability
under Section 4069 of ERISA in the event such plan has been or were to be
terminated (each, a " _Plan_ ," and collectively, the " _Plans_ "). None of
the Seller, the Quadrem Group nor any Quadrem Subsidiary has an express or
implied commitment or obligation (x) to create, incur liability with respect
to, or cause to exist, any other employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement, (y) to enter into any contract or agreement to provide
compensation or benefits to any individual, or (z) to modify, change or
terminate any Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or
termination required by ERISA or the Code.

(b) The Seller, the Quadrem Group or a Quadrem Subsidiary, as applicable, has
furnished Buyer with a true and complete copy of each Plan (or a written
summary where the Plan is not in writing) and a true and complete copy of each
of the following documents, if any, prepared in connection with each such
Plan: (i) each prototype or mass submitter Plans adoption agreement, (ii)
each funded Plans trust agreement or other funding arrangement, (iii) each
funded Plans investment policy, (iv) for each Plan subject to ERISA, each
summary plan description and summary of material modifications, (v) the three
(3) most recent annual reports (Form 5500 series and all schedules and
financial statements attached thereto) filed, if any, that are required under
ERISA or the Code in connection with each Plan, (vi) for each Plan intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, the most recently received Internal
Revenue Service opinion or determination letter for each Plan intended to

Section 401(k) of the Code, the most recent test reports demonstrating
compliance with the contribution limitations of Section 415 of the Code, the
actual deferral percentage requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code, the

in Section 3(2) of ERISA, the resolutions of the Board of Directors of the
Quadrem Group or the applicable Quadrem Subsidiary adopting the Plan and (x)

that are required to be prepared or filed under the applicable laws of such
foreign jurisdiction.

(c) None of the Plans is a multi-employer plan (within the meaning of Section
3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a " _Multi-employer Plan_ ") or a single
employer pension plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for
which the Quadrem Group could incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of
ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ ").

(d) Schedule 3.11(d) lists each Person who the Seller, the Quadrem Group or
any Quadrem Subsidiary reasonably believes is, with respect to the Quadrem
Group, any Quadrem Subsidiary and/or any person that is a member of the same
controlled group as the Seller, the Quadrem Group or any Quadrem Subsidiary or
under common control with the Seller, the Quadrem Group or any Quadrem
Subsidiary within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code (each, an " _ERISA
Affiliate_ ") a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined as of
the date of this Agreement. None of the Plans provides for the payment of
separation, severance, notice,

 



20  termination or similar benefits to any person or obligates or following the
Closing will obligate any of the Seller, the Quadrem Group or any Quadrem
Subsidiary to pay separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits
solely or partially as a result of any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement or as a result of a "change in ownership or control," within the
meaning of such term under Section 280G of the Code. Except as listed in
Schedule 3.11(d), none of the Plans could provide, or give rise to, any
payment or benefit that reasonably could be characterized as a "parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law). Except as listed in Schedule
3.11(d), neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or together
with another event, will (i) result in any payment (including, without
limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute,
forgiveness of indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due under any Plan, whether
or not such payment is contingent, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise
payable under any Plan or other arrangement, (iii) result in the acceleration
of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any benefits, or (iv) affect in
any material respects any Plans current treatment under any Laws including
any Tax or social contribution Law. Except as listed in Schedule 3.11(d), no
Plan provides, or reflects or represents any liability to provide, retiree
health, disability, or life insurance coverage to any person for any reason,
except as may be required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1985, as amended (" _COBRA_ "), or other applicable statute, and the
Quadrem Group has never represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral
or written form) to any employee (either individually or to employees as a
group) or any other person that such employee or other person would be
provided with retiree health, disability, or life insurance coverage after
retirement or other termination of service, except to the extent required by
statute.

(e) Each Plan is now and always has been operated in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws
including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code. The Seller, the Quadrem
Group and each Quadrem Subsidiary have performed all obligations required to
be performed by it under, is not in any respect in default under or in
violation of, and has no knowledge of any default or violation by any party
to, any Plan. No action, claim or Proceeding is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Seller, the Quadrem Group and each Quadrem Subsidiary,
threatened with respect to any Plan (other than claims for benefits in the
ordinary course) and no fact or event exists that could reasonably give rise
to any such action, claim or Proceeding. None of the Quadrem Group, any
Quadrem Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates is subject to
any penalty or Tax with respect to any Plan under Section 502(i) of ERISA or
Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code. Each Plan can be amended, terminated
or otherwise discontinued at any time without material liability to Buyer, the
Quadrem Group or any Quadrem Subsidiary or any of their ERISA Affiliates
(other than ordinary administration expenses). None of the Seller, the
Quadrem Group, any Quadrem Subsidiary or any Affiliate has, prior to the
Closing and in any material respect, violated any of the health care
continuation requirements of COBRA, the requirements of the Family Medical
Leave Act of 1993, the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, the requirements of the Womens Health and Cancer
Rights Act of 1998, the requirements of the Newborns and Mothers Health
Protection Act of 1996, or any amendment to each such act, or any similar
provisions of state Law applicable to its employees.

 



21 (f) Each Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) or Section 401(k) of
the Code and each trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the Code
(i) has received a favorable determination, opinion, notification or advisory
letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to each such Plan as to
its qualified status under the Code, including all amendments to the Code
effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation, and no fact
or event has occurred since the date of such letter from the Internal
Revenue Service to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Plan or
the exempt status of any such trust, or (ii) has remaining a period of time
under applicable Treasury regulations or Internal Revenue Service
pronouncements in which to apply for such a letter and make any amendments
necessary to obtain a favorable letter as to the qualified status of each such
Plan.

(g) None of the Seller, the Quadrem Group, any Quadrem Group Affiliate or any
ERISA Affiliate maintains or ever has maintained any employee benefit plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA or similar laws of a foreign jurisdiction.

(h) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made or accrued
with respect to any Plan have been made on or before their due dates. All
such contributions have been fully deducted for income tax purposes (to the
extent deductible) and no such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by
any Governmental Entity and no fact or event exists which would reasonably
give rise to any such challenge or disallowance. None of the Plans is self-
insured and neither the Quadrem Group nor any Quadrem Subsidiary has, within
the past six (6) years, maintained, established, sponsored, participated in
or contributed to any self insured plan that provides benefits to employees or
directors.

organizational campaigns, petitions or other unionization activities seeking
recognition of a collective bargaining unit that could affect the Seller, the
Quadrem Group or Quadrem Subsidiary; (ii) there are no organized strikes,

employees, and none of the Seller, the Quadrem Group or any Quadrem Subsidiary
have experienced any such organized strike, slowdown or work stoppage within
the past three years; (iii) none of the Seller, the Quadrem Group or any
Quadrem Subsidiary have engaged in any unfair labor practice, and there are no

the disclosure of such information conflicts with the data privacy Laws of
such jurisdiction, the information required to be provided

 



23  under this sentence shall not include any information the disclosure of
which would result in such a conflict. For the sake of clarity with respect to
the proviso contained in the preceding sentence, if a jurisdiction would
require prior notification to or consent of the individual employee concerning
such disclosure of personally-identifiable information, then the disclosure
required shall not include the employees name, position, date of hire, visa
status and/or leave status or other personally-identifiable information
concerning the employee; provided that, to the extent practicable, Seller
shall provide such omitted categories of information on an aggregate

entity. Each employee of any of the Seller, the Quadrem Group or any Quadrem
Subsidiary is employed "at will" and can be terminated at any time, for any or

in any jurisdiction in which the disclosure of such information conflicts with
the data privacy Laws of such jurisdiction, the information required to

disclosure of which would result in such a conflict. For the sake of clarity
with respect to the proviso contained in the preceding sentence, if a
jurisdiction would require prior notification to or consent of the consultant
concerning such disclosure of personally-identifiable information, then the
disclosure required shall not include personally-identifiable information
concerning the consultant; provided that, to the extent practicable, Seller
shall provide such omitted categories of information on an aggregate basis for
all consultants engaged at a particular location or by a particular entity.
Each consultant to any of the Seller, the Quadrem Group or any Quadrem

after learning of any claim, action, suit, arbitration, mediation, Proceeding

(a) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition and
inducement to Seller to enter into this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall
enter into the Registration Rights Agreement in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit G_ (the " _Registration Rights Agreement_ "), which provides, among
other things, that Buyer shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-3 (the " _Shelf Registration Statement_ ") for the purpose
of registering under the Securities Act the Buyer Shares issued to the Company
pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(i) in order to permit the Company to resell such
shares on a delayed on continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act.

(b) Subject to complying with its obligations under the Registration Rights
Agreement, if Buyer is unable cause the Shelf Registration Statement to be
declared effective under Securities Act within thirty (30) says after filing
such registration statement with the SEC (unless the SEC advises Buyer that
such shares are eligible to be registered pursuant to General Instruction I.D
of Form S-3), then Buyer may at its option apply for a permit (a "
_California Permit_ ") from the California Department of Corporations (after a
hearing before such Department) pursuant to Section 25121 of the California
Corporate Securities Law of 1968, as amended (the " _Fairness Hearing Law_
"), such that the issuance of Buyer Shares pursuant to Sections 2.01 and 2.04
to shall be exempt from registration under the Securities Act by virtue of the
exemption from the registration contained in Section 3(a)(10) thereof, and
the Seller shall prepare a related information statement or other disclosure
document (the " _Information Statement_ ") to be distributed if necessary to
the Company. The Seller shall cooperate with, and provide information to,
Buyer in connection with Buyers application for the California Permit. The
Seller and Buyer will respond to any comments from the California Commissioner
of Corporations and use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
California Permit to be granted as soon as reasonably practicable after such
filing; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Buyer nor the Seller shall
be required to modify any of the terms of the Acquisition in order to cause
the California Secretary of State to approve the fairness of such terms and
conditions. The Seller shall provide and include in the Information Statement
such information relating to the Seller as may be required pursuant to the
Fairness Hearing Law or by the California Department of Corporations. None of
the information supplied by the Seller to Buyer in connection with the
California Permit application or any other document prepared to comply with
Federal or state securities laws shall contain any untrue statement of
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements contained therein not misleading. None of the information
supplied by Buyer in connection with the California Permit application or
any other document prepared to comply with Federal or state securities laws

(c) In the event that by February 16, 2011 (the " _Determination Date_ "), (i)
Buyer is unable to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to be declared
effective by the SEC (unless the SEC advises Buyer that such shares are
eligible to be registered pursuant to General

 



58  Instruction I.D of Form S-3) or (ii) either (A) the Commissioner of
Corporations of the State of California (xx) denies the California Permit or
(yy) does not issue the California Permit or (B) if Buyer and the Company
mutually determine they will not receive the California Permit by the
Determination Date, then Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to either file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC (the " _S-4
Registration Statement_ ") on or prior to ninety (90) days after the
Determination Date or rely on the exemption from registration set forth in
Section 4(2) and/or Regulation S of the Securities Act for the issuance of
the Buyer Common Stock in the Acquisition. In either event, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Buyer Common Stock issued
pursuant to Section 2.01 to be eligible for public resale and shall consult
with the Company to determine the most expedient means to cause the Buyer
Common Stock to be eligible for public resale. Subject to applicable Law and

appropriate to amend or supplement the S-4 Registration Statement in order to
make the statements contained or incorporated by reference therein not
misleading or to comply with applicable Law, and the Seller shall cooperate in
filing with the SEC or its staff or any other government officials,
and/or delivering any such amendment or supplement;

the S-4 Registration Statement and Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective as
promptly as practicable thereafter;

comments from the SEC or its staff and or any request by the SEC or its staff
or any other government officials for amendments or supplements to the S-4
Registration Statement or any other filing or for additional information and
shall supply the other with copies of all correspondence between such party
or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff or
any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the S-4
Registration Statement or other filing;

 

(iv) the S-4 Registration Statement and any other materials will comply in all
material respects with applicable Law; and 

(v) the information supplied by the Seller for inclusion in the S-4
Registration Statement shall not, at (1) the time the S-4 Registration
Statement is filed, amended, supplemented or declared effective and (2) the
Closing contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading. Buyer shall be responsible for all filing
fees associated with the Shelf Registration Statement, the California Permit

Subsidiaries (including the Quadrem Group and the Quadrem Subsidiaries) and to
the books and records thereof and (ii) furnish promptly such information
concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel
and other aspects of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including the Quadrem
Group and the Quadrem Subsidiaries) as Buyer or its Representatives may

meet with the officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including the
Quadrem Group and the Quadrem Subsidiaries) responsible for the financial
statements and internal controls of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including the Quadrem Group and the Quadrem Subsidiaries) to discuss such
matters as Buyer may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate to satisfy its
obligations under Section 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
any rules and regulations relating thereto.

(b) After the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Quadrem Group and the Quadrem

disclosed to the Companys Representatives who need to know such
information, who are provided with a copy of this Agreement and who are

required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or
documents in any Proceeding to disclose any such information, the Company
shall provide the Buyer with prompt notice of any such request or requirement
so that the Buyer may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy
and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.02(b). If, in
the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver
by the Buyer, the Company or any of its Representatives are nonetheless, in

Company or its Representative may, without liability hereunder, disclose
to such third party only that portion of such information which such counsel
advises in writing is legally required to be disclosed, provided that the
Company exercises its reasonable best efforts to preserve the confidentiality
of the such information, including, without limitation, by cooperating with
the Buyer to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such information by any
third party to which disclosure is made.

limitation, any proposal or offer to its shareholders) that constitutes, or

information in connection with such proposal or inquiry or for access to the
properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Quadrem Group or any Quadrem Subsidiary) by any person that
informs or has informed the Seller that it is considering making or has made
such a proposal or inquiry. Such notice to Buyer shall indicate in reasonable
detail the identity of the person making such proposal or inquiry and the
terms and conditions of such proposal or inquiry. The Seller immediately shall
cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations
with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to a Competing Transaction.
The Seller agrees not to release any third party from, or waive any provision
of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party
related in any way to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including the

Quadrem Subsidiary who become employees of the Buyer or of any of its
Subsidiaries after the Closing shall continue in their existing benefit plans
on substantially the same terms and conditions in the aggregate as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing until such time as, in Buyers sole
discretion, an orderly transition can be accomplished to employee benefit

Employee who either remains employed by the Quadrem Group or any Quadrem
Subsidiary after the Closing or becomes an employee of the Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries after the Closing shall become eligible for coverage under
the employee benefits plans and programs maintained by the Buyer for its and
its affiliates employees as soon as is practicable following the Closing. In
each case, to the extent permitted under Buyers employee benefit plans and
programs, as in effect from time to time, if applicable, such employee
benefits shall be provided without any preexisting conditions, limitations or
exclusions to the extent no such limitations or exclusions applied as of the
Closing to such employees under the plans of Seller, the Quadrem Group and
each Quadrem Subsidiary in which such employees participate immediately prior
to the Closing Date and with credit for all annual deductibles and co-payments
made under such applicable entitys employee benefit plans for the covered
expenses already incurred by employees of Seller, the Quadrem Group and each
Quadrem Subsidiary for the year in which the Closing occurs. To the extent
permitted under Buyers employee benefit plans and programs, as in effect from
time to time, if applicable (it being understood that Buyers equity

plan or program), Buyer shall provide employees of the Seller, the Quadrem
Group and each Quadrem Subsidiary who become employees of the Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries or who remain employed with the Company or any Quadrem
Subsidiary after the Closing (all such employees, " _Continuing Employees_ ")
with credit for all service with the applicable employer entity under all
applicable employee benefit plans, including for purposes of eligibility,
waiting periods, vesting and other plan rights and features, to the same
extent such service would have been recognized by the Seller, the Quadrem
Group or a Quadrem Subsidiary (in each case, as applicable) under comparable
plans immediately prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall take such reasonable
actions as are necessary to allow Continuing Employees to participate in the
health, welfare and other benefit programs of Buyer, to the extent permitted
by Buyers benefits and employee benefits programs, or alternative benefits
programs in the aggregate that are substantially equivalent to those
applicable to employees of Buyer in similar functions and positions on
similar terms. Such employees may be eligible to participate in Buyers
equity incentive and cash bonus plans at the sole discretion of Buyer.

(b) Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer has entered
into employment agreements (collectively, the " _Employment Agreements_ ,"
and, individually, an " _Employment Agreement_ ") with the individuals set
forth on Schedule 6.04(b)(1) hereto and transition agreements (collectively,
the " _Transition Agreements_ ," and individually, a " _Transition Agreement_

401(k) plan adopted by Quadrem US, Inc. and Quadrem Continental, Inc. (the "

three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall have received
from the Company evidence that the Boards of Directors of Quadrem US, Inc. and
Quadrem Continental, Inc. have adopted resolutions to terminate or withdraw
(as applicable) from the 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which
resolutions shall be subject to Buyers reasonable approval) and taken other
necessary corporate actions to terminate or withdraw (as applicable) from the
401(k) Plan.

each ERISA Affiliate thereof agree to terminate any and all group severance,
separation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements. Not less
than three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall receive

contingent on the Closing.

(f) The Seller, the Quadrem Group and any Quadrem Subsidiary shall take all
action necessary to terminate any PEO Agreement effective prior to the
Closing.

 

(g) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, none of the provisions contained
herein shall operate to duplicate any benefit provided to any employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (including the Quadrem Group or any Quadrem
Subsidiary) or the funding of any such benefit. Nothing in this Section 6.04
shall be construed to entitle any employee to continue his or her employment
for any period of time, nor to interfere with the rights of Buyer and/or the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (including the Quadrem Group or any Quadrem
Subsidiary) to discharge or discipline any employee, to change the terms of
any employees employment or to amend or terminate employee benefits plans or
programs at any time.

(b) Buyer and the Seller shall file as soon as practicable after the date

_Exchange Act_ ") and listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. Global Market ("
_Nasdaq_ ") or such other market as may be reasonably acceptable to the
Company. The Buyer Shares to be issued to the Company at

 



74  Closing shall have been authorized for listing on Nasdaq, the New York Stock
Exchange or another market reasonably acceptable to the Company.

such that the conditions set forth in Sections 7.03(a) and 7.03(b) would not
be satisfied (" _Terminating Buyer Breach_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that,
if such Terminating Buyer Breach is curable by Buyer through the exercise of
its commercially reasonable efforts and for so long as Buyer continues to

cured).

Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and of no further force and effect, there shall be no liability under this
Agreement on the part of Buyer or the Seller or any of their respective

Section 8.02 and Article X shall remain in full force and effect and survive
any termination of this Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any
party from liability for the breach of any of its representations or
warranties or the breach of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, including all Losses resulting from such breach (provided

breaching party must be initiated prior to the six (6) month anniversary of
the effective date of termination).

ARTICLE IX

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

SECTION 9.01 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.

(a) The representations and warranties of the Seller contained in this
Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and the documents and certificates
delivered pursuant to Section 7.02(a) and (b) hereof (collectively, the "
_Acquisition Documents_ ") shall survive the Closing for a period ending on
the day (the " _Expiration Date_ ") that is the fifteen (15) month anniversary
of the Closing or in the case of certain other representations and warranties

 



76  (the " _Fundamental Representations_ ") set forth in Section 3.04
(Capitalization), Section 3.05 (Authority Relative to the Agreement), Section
3.06 (No Conflicts), Section 3.15 (Taxes), Section 3.14 (Intellectual
Property), Section 3.34 (Compliance with Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and
Anti-Bribery Laws and Regulations), Section 3.35 (Compliance with Export
Control Laws) and Section 3.36 (Government Investigation and Voluntary
Disclosure) shall survive the Closing for a period of thirty (30) months. The
representations and warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement shall not survive beyond the Closing, and any liability of
Buyer with respect to such representations and warranties shall thereupon
cease. Neither the period of survival nor the liability of the Seller with
respect to the Sellers representations and warranties or the liability of
the Company Stockholders under the Stockholder Agreement shall be affected by
any investigation made at any time (whether before or after the Closing) by or
on behalf of Buyer or by any actual, implied or constructive knowledge or
notice of any facts or circumstances that Buyer may have as a result of any
such investigation or otherwise. The parties hereto agree that reliance shall
not be an element of any claim for misrepresentation or indemnification under
this Agreement. The waiver by Buyer of any condition based on the accuracy of
any such representation or warranty, or based on the performance of, or
compliance with, any covenant or obligation, shall not affect the right to
indemnification or other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
covenants or obligations. If written notice of a claim has been given prior to
the expiration of the applicable representations and warranties by a Buyer
Indemnified Party to the Company or the Stockholders Representative, as the
case may be, then the relevant representations and warranties shall survive as
to such claim until such claim has been finally resolved. The expiration of
the survival period for any representation and warranty shall not affect the
rights of (i) any Buyer Indemnified Party to seek indemnification from any
Indemnifying Party (as defined below) under Article IX, or otherwise seek
recovery of losses or any other recovery from any Indemnifying Party, in any
such case as a result of any fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation by any Indemnifying Party upon, against or to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties in connection with the Acquisition, or (ii) the Buyer to
seek indemnification under any Stockholder Agreement or Major Entitled
Optionee Agreement as a result of any fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation by any Indemnifying Party upon, against or to the Buyer in
connection with the Acquisition. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge
and agree that the term "intentional misrepresentation," as used in this
Agreement or any other Acquisition Document, with respect to a Person shall
mean "intentional misrepresentation" as defined under New York law and shall
in any event include a statement or communication by such Person that was
actually known by such Person at the time the statement or communication was
made to be false or misleading or a statement that was made by such Person
recklessly and without regard for its truthfulness.

(b) The respective covenants, agreements and obligations of the Seller and
Buyer set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate, document or other
instrument delivered pursuant to Section 7.02, in the case of the Seller, and
Section 7.03, in the case of Buyer, shall survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, any investigation by or on behalf of any party hereto, and
the Closing without limitation.

 



77 SECTION 9.02 _Indemnification by the Indemnifying Party_.

 

(a) As an integral term of the Acquisition, after the Closing, Buyer and its
affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Quadrem Group and the Quadrem
Subsidiaries), officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be, subject to the
limitations contained in this Article IX, indemnified and held harmless by
the Seller (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") and, solely pursuant to the
Stockholder Agreements and Major Entitled Optionee Agreements, the Company
Stockholders and Major Entitled Optionees, as applicable, for any and all
liabilities, losses, damages of any kind (whether direct, indirect or
consequential), decline in value, claims, costs, expenses, fines, fees,
royalties, deficiencies, interest, awards, reduction in net operating losses
(except for any reduction in net operating losses resulting from the
continued profitability of the Quadrem Group and the Quadrem Subsidiaries),
judgments, amounts paid in settlement and penalties (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys, consultants and experts fees and
expenses and other costs of defending, investigating or settling claims)
suffered, incurred, or paid by them (including, without limitation, in
connection with any action brought or otherwise initiated by any of them)
(collectively, " _Losses_ "), without adjustment for any insurance recovery
(excluding any insurance recovery under any directors and officers insurance
purchased by the Company or its Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date)
or tax deduction relating thereto, arising out of or resulting from:

(i) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in any Acquisition Document (disregarding for purposes of this Section
9.02(a)(i) any "material," "in all material respects," "Quadrem Material
Adverse Effect" or similar qualification contained therein or with respect
thereto both for purposes of determining whether a representation or warranty
is inaccurate or has been breached and for purposes of calculating Losses);

 

(ii) the breach or default of any covenant or agreement made by any of the
Seller in any Acquisition Document;

 

(iii) any cost, loss or other expense (excluding any lost or disallowed Tax
deduction) as a result of the application of Section 280G of the Code to any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement plus any necessary gross up
amount (the " _280G Losses_ ");

(iv) any fees and expenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
fees and expenses of their financial advisors, accountants, legal counsel and
consultants, that are paid by Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the Quadrem
Acquisition Expenses), except to the extent payment of such fees and expenses
reduces the Base Consideration pursuant to Article II; 

(v) (A) any indemnification obligations owing by Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Quadrem Group and the Quadrem
Subsidiaries) to any past or present officers or directors of Quadrem or
Quadrem Subsidiaries (whether under the applicable Law, the respective
Organizational Documents of the Quadrem Group or Quadrem Subsidiaries, any
current indemnification agreement, this Agreement or otherwise) with respect
to

 



78  claims made against such past or present officers or directors with respect
to any act or omission by such officers or directors, in their capacity as
such, prior to the Closing, or (B) any liability resulting from any act
omission occurring prior to the Closing constituting a breach or alleged
breach of a fiduciary duty or a breach or alleged breach of applicable law by
past or present officers and directors of the Quadrem Group or Quadrem
Subsidiaries, in their capacities as such, prior to Closing.

(vi) to the extent not recovered from the Escrow Fund pursuant to §2.03(c),
the amount, if any, by which Estimated Closing Date Working Capital exceeds
the Final Closing Date Working Capital as provided in Section 2.03(c), but
with no payment to the extent as provided in Section 2.03(c);

(vii) any violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations and any export
control laws or regulations occurring prior to the Closing Date, including
(A) any violation discovered after the Closing Date whether known or unknown
to Buyer or Seller at the time of the Closing Date, (B) the reasonable costs
of Buyers investigation of the same, including but not limited to costs of
retaining outside counsel or consultants to assist in the investigation and
representation before the responsible government authority, and (C) all fines,
penalties, or reasonable costs associated with remedial compliance measures
related to any such violation;

(viii) any Loss incurred by Buyer as a result of the possession or hosting of
information subject to export control laws or regulations by Buyer after the
Closing Date to the extent such information was possessed or hosted by Quadrem
or any Quadrem Subsidiary on the Quadrem Network prior to the Closing Date,
including (A) fines or penalties imposed by any Governmental Entity, (B)
reasonable costs of defense (including retention of outside counsel and
consultants) of Proceedings initiated by any Governmental Entity; (C)
reasonable costs of Buyers investigation (including retention of outside
counsel and consultants) initiated as a result of any Proceedings initiated by
any Governmental Entity or as a result of Buyers decision to self-report
violations discovered after the Closing Date (provided that such violations
are, in fact, self-reported); and (D) any other Losses, as defined above; and

 

(ix) any of the items set forth on Schedule 9.02(a).

 

(b) As used herein, "Losses" are not limited to matters asserted by third
parties, but include Losses suffered, incurred or accrued by a Buyer
Indemnified Party for which such Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02(a). In the event the Quadrem Group or
any Quadrem Subsidiary suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any
Losses as a result of or in connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Seller hereunder, then
(without limiting any of the rights of the Quadrem Group and
Quadrem Subsidiaries as a Buyer Indemnified Party) Buyer shall also be
deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the stock of Quadrem, to have incurred
Losses as a result of and in connection with such inaccuracy or breach but in
either case the total amount both Buyer and Quadrem may recover shall not
exceed the amount of Losses.

 



79 SECTION 9.03 _Limitation_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein and in the Stockholder Agreements,
recovery from the Escrow Cash shall be the sole and exclusive remedy under
this Agreement for the matters set forth in Section 9.02(a). Notwithstanding
any other provision contained herein, any Buyer Indemnified Party may seek
recovery of Losses arising out of any fraud, willful misconduct or
intentional misrepresentation by any Indemnifying Party upon, against or to
such Buyer Indemnified Party in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Acquisition without regards to such limitation.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, but subject to
Section 9.03(c), no Buyer Indemnified Person may receive any recovery in
respect of any claim for indemnification that is made pursuant to Section 9.02
unless and until Losses arising out of or resulting from the
causes enumerated in Section 9.02(a) (other than Losses resulting from claims
based on clauses (iv), (v) or (vi) of Section 9.02(a)) in an aggregate amount
greater than US$250,000 (the " _Basket_ ") have been incurred, paid or
properly accrued, in which case the Indemnified Persons may make claims for
indemnification for the full amount of aggregate Losses, including the Basket.

(c) The aggregate amount recoverable against the Indemnifying Party under this
Article IX for any Losses resulting from any fraud, willful misconduct or
intentional misrepresentation by any Indemnifying Party upon, against or to
the Buyer in connection with the Acquisition shall not exceed the Total
Acquisition Consideration actually received by such parties.

(d) With respect to any Losses arising out of any fraud, willful misconduct or
intentional misrepresentation by any Indemnifying Party upon, against or to
any Buyer Indemnified Party in connection with the Acquisition for which
recovery from the Escrow Cash is not the sole and exclusive remedy pursuant to
Section 9.03(a) (" _Non-Escrow Matters_ ") for which the Buyer Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or the
Stockholder Agreements, the Indemnified Parties may (i) recover from the
Escrow Cash or (ii) recover directly against the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with any limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Stockholder
Agreements and Major Entitled Optionee Agreements, as the case may be. If as a
result of this Section 9.03(d), indemnification payments are made to Buyer
Indemnified Parties for Non-Escrow Matters, through recovery from the
Escrow Cash and the Escrow Cash is insufficient to indemnify for Losses
relating to matters that would, but for the prior sentence, be recoverable
pursuant to this Article IX, then notwithstanding Section 9.03(a) but
otherwise subject to the limitations (and exceptions thereto) with respect to
such matters (including the Basket limitation and the time limitations
applicable to claims regarding those matters), the Indemnifying Party shall
indemnify, compensate, reimburse and pay for any Losses that are directly or
indirectly suffered, incurred or accrued by such Buyer Indemnified Party, or
to which such Indemnifying Party may otherwise become subject, and which arise
from or as a result of, or are directly or indirectly connected with any such
matter.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this
Agreement shall preclude Buyer from seeking injunctive relief or specific
performance with

 



80  respect to any covenant, agreement or obligation of any of the Indemnifying
Party contained in this Agreement.

 

(f) No Indemnifying Party shall have any right of contribution, right of
indemnity or other right (except for any rights of subrogation explicitly
provided herein) or remedy against the Quadrem Group or Quadrem Subsidiaries
in connection with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to
which such Indemnifying Party may become subject under or in connection this
Agreement.

SECTION 9.04 _Appointment of Stockholders  Representative_. Seller hereby
represents, warrants and agrees that the Stockholders Representative has
been designated as the representative of the Seller and as the attorney-in-
fact and agent for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Party, each Company
Stockholder and each Major Entitled Optionee, as applicable, with respect to
(i) claims for indemnification under this Article IX, (ii) for purposes of the
Holdback Release Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Registration Rights
Agreement and (iii) for the purposes set forth in Section 2.03, related to
the working capital adjustment, and the taking by the Representative of any
and all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to be
taken by the Stockholders Representative under this Agreement, the Holdback
Release Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement,
including the exercise of the power to: (a) give and receive notices and
communications to or from Buyer (on behalf of itself or any Indemnifying
Party, any Company Stockholder and any Major Entitled Optionee) relating to
this Agreement, Holdback Release Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the
Registration Rights Agreement or any of the transactions and other matters
contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement
expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication shall be given or
received by such Persons individually); (b) authorize the release or delivery
to Buyer of Escrow Cash in satisfaction of indemnification claims by a Buyer
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX (including by not objecting to
such claims) and the Escrow Agreement; (c) agree to, object to, negotiate,
resolve, enter into settlements and compromises of, demand litigation of, and
comply with orders of courts with respect to, (i) any amendment hereto or of
the Holdback Release Agreement, Escrow Agreement or the Registration Rights
Agreement after the date hereof (ii) indemnification claims by any Buyer
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX or (iii) any other claim by any
Buyer Indemnified Party, against any Indemnifying Party or by any Indemnifying
Party against any Buyer Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Buyer
Indemnified Party and any Indemnifying Party, in each case relating to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement or any of
the transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby; (d)
selection of the Auditor under Sections 2.03 and 2.06, and (e) take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The Stockholders
Representative shall have authority and power to act on behalf of each
Indemnifying Party, Company Stockholder and Major Entitled Optionee, as
applicable, with respect to the disposition, settlement or other handling of
all claims pursuant to this Article IX, the Holdback Release Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, and all rights or
obligations arising pursuant to this Article IX, the Holdback Release
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement. Each
Indemnifying Party, Company Stockholders and Major Entitled Optionee, as
applicable, shall be conclusively bound, without right of appeal or objection,
by all actions taken and documents executed by the Stockholders
Representative in connection with

 



81  this Article IX, the Holdback Release Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
the Registration Rights Agreement, and each Buyer Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to rely on any action or decision of the Stockholders
Representative. The Person serving as the Stockholders Representative may be
replaced from time to time by Company Stockholders as provided in an agreement
with the Stockholders Representative and upon not less than thirty (30)
days prior written notice to Buyer. No bond shall be required of the
Stockholders Representative. Notices or communications to or from the
Stockholders Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Company
pursuant to Section 10.01.

SECTION 9.05 _Notice of Claim; Claims Period_. As used herein, (i) the term "
_Claim_ " means a claim for indemnification for Losses under this Article IX
by a Buyer Indemnified Party and (ii) the term " _Proceeding_ " means any
civil, criminal or administrative action, cause of action, lawsuit,
arbitration, proceeding, hearing, charge, complaint, claim, citation, notice,
request, demand, assessment, audit, examination or other legal, governmental,
administrative or arbitral proceeding, investigation or inquiry, regardless
of whether a proceeding or lawsuit has been initiated. A Buyer Indemnified
Party shall give notice of a Claim under this Agreement (a " _Notice of Claim_
") to the Stockholders Representative specifying in reasonable detail
the following information:

(a) The matters specified in Section 9.02 to which the Claim relates; or 

(b) Whether the claim is based on a Proceeding brought by a third party (other
than a party to this Agreement) against such Indemnified Person (in each such
case, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") that is based on, arises out of or relates to
any matter specified in Section 9.02.

 

(c) That the Buyer Indemnified Party has directly or indirectly incurred or
paid or, in good faith, believes it shall have to directly or indirectly
incur or pay, Losses in an aggregate stated amount arising from such Claim
(which amount may be the amount of damages claimed by a third party in an
action brought against any Buyer Indemnified Party based on alleged
facts, which if true, would give rise to liability for Losses under this
Article IX); and

(d) A brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably
available), of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the alleged
Losses based on the good faith belief thereof, including the identity and
address of any third-party claimant (to the extent reasonably available) and
copies of any formal demand or complaint, the amount of Losses, the date each
such item was incurred, paid or properly accrued, or the basis for such
anticipated liability, and the specific nature of the breach to which such
item is related.

The period during which Claims may be initiated (the " _Claims Period_ ") for
indemnification shall commence at the Closing and terminate on (i) the day
that is the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the Closing for all Claims based
on the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranties other than the
Fundamental Representations; (ii) the day that is the thirty (30) month
anniversary of the Closing for all Claims based on the inaccuracy or breach of
any Fundamental Representation; and (iii) the day that is the six (6) year
anniversary of the Closing for all Claims based on fraud, willful misconduct
or intentional misrepresentation by any Indemnifying Party upon, against or to
any Buyer Indemnified Party in connection with the Acquisition.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any bona fide
Claims for Losses

 



82  specified in any Notice of Claim delivered in accordance herewith prior to
expiration of the applicable Claims Period with respect to facts and
circumstances existing prior to expiration of the applicable Claims Period
shall remain outstanding until such Claims for Losses have been resolved or
satisfied pursuant to this Article IX and, if applicable, the Escrow
Agreement, notwithstanding the expiration of such Claims Period. Until
the expiration of the applicable Claims Period, no delay on the part of an
indemnified party in giving a Notice of Claim shall relieve the Indemnifying
Person from any of its obligations under this Article IX unless the
Indemnified Person is materially prejudiced thereby.

SECTION 9.06 _Defense of Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) Within 10 business days of delivery of a Notice of Claim with respect to a
Third Party Claim, the Stockholders Representative may elect (by written
notice delivered to Buyer) to take all necessary steps properly to diligently
contest any Third Party Claim or to prosecute such Third Party Claim to
conclusion or, subject to Section 9.06(e), settlement,  _provided_ that as a
condition to such election the Stockholders Representative acknowledges the
obligation of the Seller pursuant to this Article IX to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties for all Losses subject to any applicable limitations that
may result from such Third-Party Claim. If the Stockholders Representative
makes the foregoing election, Buyer Indemnified Parties will have the right to
participate at their own expense in all negotiations and Proceedings. If the
Stockholders Representative does not make such election within such period or
fails to diligently contest such Third Party Claim after such election, the
Buyer shall be free to handle the prosecution or defense of any such Third
Party Claim and will permit the Stockholders Representative, at the sole
cost of the Stockholders Representative, to participate in such prosecution
or defense and will provide the Stockholders Representative with reasonable
access to all relevant information and documentation relating to the Claim
and the prosecution or defense thereof.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Third Party Claim (i) includes Losses
equal to an amount that, together with all other pending Claims, is in excess
of the value of the Escrow Cash on the date of the Third Party Claim, (ii)
relates to any Quadrem Intellectual Property or other intellectual property
issues material to the conduct of the business of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries or the Buyers business, (iii) involves any action by any
Governmental Entity or (iv) seeks any injunction, declaratory judgment or
other non-monetary or other equitable relief against Buyer or its affiliates,
Buyer shall have the right, at its election and without compromising the
rights of any Buyer Indemnified Parties to indemnification hereunder, to
retain control of the defense of such Claim rather than cede control of such
claim to the Stockholders Representative.

(c) The party not in control of the prosecution or defense of a Third Party
Claim will reasonably cooperate with the other party in the conduct of the
prosecution or defense of such Third Party Claim. 

(d) If the Stockholders Representative controls the defense of the Third
Party Claim, the Stockholders Representative will not compromise or settle
any Third Party Claim without the written consent of Buyer, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. For purposes of clarification, Buyer may
withhold its consent to any compromise or settlement if

 



83  such compromise or settlement does not include a full general release of all
the claims against the Buyer Indemnified Parties from all parties to the
litigation or requires Buyer or any of its affiliates to perform any material
covenant or refrain from engaging in any material activity. If the Buyer
controls the defense of the Third Party Claim, the Buyer shall not compromise
or settle any Third Party Claim without the written consent of the
Stockholders Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. For purposes of clarification, Stockholders Representative may
withhold its consent to any compromise or settlement if such compromise or
settlement does not include a full general release of the Seller and its
affiliates from all parties to the litigation or requires the Seller or its
affiliates to perform any material covenant or refrain from engaging in any
material activity.

 

(e) If a Buyer Indemnified Party proceeds with the defense of any Third Party
Claim, all fees and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, relating
to the defense of such Third Party Claim shall be deemed to be Losses for
which the Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 

SECTION 9.07 _Resolution of Notice of Claim_. Each Notice of Claim given shall
be resolved as follows:

 

(a) _Uncontested Claims_. If, within thirty (30) days after a Notice of Claim
is received, the Stockholders Representative does not contest such Notice of
Claim in writing as provided in Section 9.07(b), the Buyer shall be entitled
to recover the amount claimed from Escrow Cash pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement.

 

(b) _Contested Claims_. If the Stockholders Representative gives the Buyer
written notice contesting all or any portion of a Notice of Claim within the
thirty (30) day period specified in Section 9.07(a) (a " _Contested Claim_ ")
then the portion of such Contested Claim that is contested by the
Stockholders Representative shall be resolved by either (i) a written
settlement agreement executed by the Stockholders Representative and Buyer or
(ii) in the absence of such a written settlement agreement within forty (40)
business days following receipt of the written notice, by binding litigation
between the Stockholders Representative and Buyer in accordance with the
terms and provisions of Section 9.07(c). Buyer shall be entitled to recover
the amount specified in any such settlement agreement from Escrow Cash
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

(c) _Litigation of Contested Claims_. Either the Stockholders Representative
(on behalf of the Seller) or Buyer may bring suit in the courts of the State
of New York and the Federal courts of the United States of America located
within the City and State of New York to resolve the Contested Claim. The
case will be tried to the Court sitting without a jury. The decision of the
trial court as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Notice of Claim
shall be nonappealable, binding and conclusive upon the parties to
this Agreement, without right of offset, and the Buyer on its behalf or on
behalf of other Buyer Indemnified Parties, and the Stockholders
Representative, on behalf of the Seller, shall be entitled and required to act
in accordance with such decision and to cause the Escrow Agent make or
withhold payments of Escrow Cash in accordance therewith and herewith.
Judgment upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. For purposes of this Section 9.07(c), in any suit
hereunder, the Buyer or other Buyer Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be
the

 



84  prevailing party if the trial court awards the Buyer or Buyer Indemnified
Party more than one-half of the amount in dispute; otherwise, the
Stockholders Representative shall be deemed to be the prevailing party. The
non-prevailing party to a suit shall pay its own expenses and the expenses,
including attorneys fees and costs, reasonably incurred by the other party to
the suit.

 

SECTION 9.08 _Tax Consequences of Indemnification Payments_. All payments (if
any) made to the Buyer or a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to any
indemnification obligations under this Article IX will be treated as
adjustments to the Total Acquisition Consideration for Tax purposes and such
agreed treatment will govern for purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

SECTION 9.09 _Subrogation_. To the extent that any Losses are paid hereunder,
the Stockholders Representative shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, automatically, and without any further action by it, be subrogated with
respect to any rights the Buyer Indemnified Parties may have against any third
party in connection with any Losses suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
and paid by the Indemnifying Party, and the Buyer Indemnified Party agrees to
execute and deliver all documents and take all other actions reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Party to effect such subrogation; provided,
however, that the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be required to take any
actions that would be detrimental to the Buyer Indemnified Parties (including,
if it would require any Buyer Indemnified Party to incur any costs, expenses
or liabilities, or if it would require involvement of any past or present Buy-
Side Customers or Sell-Side Customers).

SECTION 10.03  _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally

such successor in interests or liquidating trusts assumption of the rights,
interests and obligations of the Seller under this Agreement, in either case
pursuant to a form of assignment reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder
shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or

assigns. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
and except as provided in the following sentence, nothing in this Agreement,

parties hereto or their respective successors and assigns any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the past and present officers and directors of
the Company shall be deemed third party beneficiaries of Section 6.10(a)
hereof, which section shall be enforceable by them. It is expressly agreed
that Section 6.04 shall _not_ confer upon any employee of the

 



92  Company any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, including in respect of the benefits matters
addressed in Section 6.04 or elsewhere in this Agreement.

America located within the City of New York in the State of New York, in
respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and hereby waive, and
agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or Proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is not subject
thereto or that such action, suit or Proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate
or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such
courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect
to such action or Proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a New York
State or Federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court
jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of
such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection
with any such action or Proceeding in the manner provided in Section 10.01 or
in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Legal Requirements,
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. With respect to any particular
action, suit or Proceeding, venue shall lie solely in the City of New York,
New York.

SECTION 10.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF

be construed or resolved against any party, whether under any rule of
construction or otherwise. No party to this Agreement shall be considered the
draftsman. The parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement has been
reviewed, negotiated, and accepted by all parties and their attorneys and
shall be construed and interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the
words used so as fairly to accomplish the purposes and intentions of all
parties hereto.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants

Buyer and the Company Stockholder hereby agree as follows:

1\. _Representations, Warranties and Acknowledgements of the Company
Stockholder_. The Company Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to Buyer

Company Stockholder is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its establishment.

(b) The Company Stockholder has all requisite power and authority to enter
into this Indemnification and Release. The execution and delivery of this
Indemnification and Release have been duly authorized by all necessary action
on the part of the Company Stockholder, and no further action is required on

delivery by the other parties hereto, constitutes the valid and binding
obligations of the Company Stockholder enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms, subject to (i) laws of general application relating to

other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and
(ii) general principles of equity.

 

(c) As of the date of this Indemnification and Release, the Company
Stockholder is the sole record and beneficial owner of the shares of Company
Stock set forth opposite its name on _Exhibit A_ hereto (subject to, in the
case of individuals, applicable community property laws).

(d) The Company Stockholder hereby acknowledges that he, she or it has
carefully read the Stock Purchase Agreement and understands that receipt by
the Company of the Total Acquisition Consideration is contingent upon certain
events and conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement, including
without limitation Section 2.02 (with respect to the Escrow Fund) and Section
2.04 (with respect to the Holdback Use Condition) of the Stock Purchase
Agreement.

(e) The Company Stockholder acknowledges that (i) at the Closing, Buyer shall

Stock Purchase Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and (ii) the Company shall
be entitled to a portion of the Escrow Fund and Holdback Consideration, if

subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Purchase Agreement, including
without limitation satisfaction of the Use Condition.

(f) If the Acquisition is consummated, the representations and warranties of
the Company Stockholder set forth in this Section 1 shall survive the Closing

representations and warranties under this Section 1 shall not exceed the
amount of the consideration for the Acquisition actually received by the
Company Stockholder, whether by distribution from the Company, redemption
of the Company Stockholders stock or otherwise and whether received before
or after such breach.

 



2 2\. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations contained in Section 2(d), the Company
Stockholder shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties
for any and all Losses, without adjustment for any insurance recovery or tax
deduction relating thereto, arising out of or resulting from the fraud,
willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation by the Company
Stockholder, any of the Company, QIL, Charlotte and QOC or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents or subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Subject Parties_ ") upon, against or to any Buyer
Indemnified Party in connection with the execution, delivery and performance
of the Stock Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Acquisition, regardless of whether or not any party other than a
Subject Party is a party to, participates in or aids and abets such fraud,
willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation. Buyer and Company
Stockholder acknowledge and agree that the term "intentional
misrepresentation," as used in this Agreement with respect to a Person shall
mean "intentional misrepresentation," as defined under New York law and shall
in any event include a statement or communication by such Person that was
actually known by such Person at the time the statement or communication was
made to be false or misleading or a statement or communication that was made
by such Person recklessly and without regard for its truthfulness.

(b) Subject to the limitations contained in Section 2(d), to the extent, but
only to the extent, that (i) Buyer recovers against the Escrow Cash for Losses
arising from the fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation
by any of the Subject Parties upon, against or to any Buyer Indemnified Party
in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of the Stock
Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Acquisition, and (ii) the Escrow Cash is thereafter insufficient to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnified Parties for Losses that would have been recoverable from
the Escrow Cash but for the recovery from the Escrow Cash for the Losses
specified in clause (i) above, the Company Stockholder shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses, without
adjustment for any insurance recovery or tax deduction relating thereto,
arising out of or resulting from the matters for which Seller is obligated to
indemnify Buyer Indemnified Parties in Article IX of the Stock Purchase
Agreement, subject to the limitations and exceptions set forth therein
(including the limitations set forth in Section 9.03(a) and 9.03(b) of the
Stock Purchase Agreement and the time limitations applicable to claims
regarding those matters).

(c) Except to the extent provided in Section 2(b), the undertaking of the
Company Stockholder in this Section 2 shall not apply to any breach by Seller
of any representation, warranty or covenant in the Stock Purchase Agreement
or any other event or occurrence set forth in Section 9.02(a) of the Stock
Purchase Agreement that does not constitute fraud, willful misconduct or
intentional misrepresentation by any of the Subject Parties upon, against or
to any Buyer Indemnified Party in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of the Stock Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Acquisition, regardless of whether or not any party
other than a Subject Party is a party to, participates in or aids and abets
such fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation, and shall in
no event apply to any claim by a third party that any of the Seller or any of
their Subsidiaries (including Quadrem and its Subsidiaries) engaged in any
act or omission constituting fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation with respect to

 



3  such third party, except to the extent that a Buyer indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 2(a) or 2(b) hereof.

 

(d) Each of the following limitations shall apply to the Company Stockholders
indemnification obligations under Section 2: 

(i) As a condition precedent to obtaining indemnification under Section 2 of
this Indemnification and Release, Buyer shall first be required to use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek indemnification from the Seller for
any Losses covered by the indemnification set forth in Section 2 to the extent
such Losses (i) are indemnified by Seller in Article IX of the Stock Purchase
Agreement and (ii) do not exceed the amount of the Escrow Fund that is not
subject to pending Claims. The indemnification provided under this
Indemnification and Release shall be available only to the extent that
such Losses are not satisfied by the Seller (" _Unsatisfied Losses_ ").

(ii) The Company Stockholders obligation under this indemnification shall be
several and not joint with respect to any other party providing
indemnification to Buyer and shall not exceed its Pro Rata Share of
Unsatisfied Losses. For the purposes of this Indemnification and Release, "
_Pro Rata Share_ " means with respect to the Company Stockholder at any
particular time the amount of the Total Acquisition Consideration actually
paid to the Company Stockholder divided by the Total Acquisition
Consideration actually paid to all holders of Company Stock that have entered
into a stockholder indemnification and limited release agreement in
substantially the same form as this Indemnification and Release at such time,
Major Entitled Optionees that have entered into Major Entitled Optionee
Agreements and the Company (but only to the extent that (i) the Company has
not distributed such proceeds to the holders of Company Stock and Major
Entitled Optionees (ii) the Company agrees to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
parties for its Pro Rata Share of the Losses).

(iii) The Company Stockholders obligation under this indemnification shall
not exceed the amount of the consideration for the Acquisition actually
received by the Company Stockholder, whether by distribution from the Company,
redemption of the Company Stockholders stock or otherwise and whether
received before or after the obligation to indemnify arises.

(iv) No claim for indemnification under this Section 2 may be made by a Buyer
Indemnified Party after the earlier of the six year anniversary of the Closing
Date or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

 

(e) The Company Stockholder shall have no indemnification obligation by reason
of fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation by any Subject
Party upon, against or to any Buyer Indemnified Party in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of the Stock Purchase Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Acquisition, unless the
Indemnified Party shall have procured a decision of a trial court in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 4(h)(ii) that contains a
finding of such fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation, as
the case may be.

 



4 (f) To the extent that any Damages are paid hereunder, the Company Stockholder
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, automatically, and without
any further action by it, be subrogated with respect to any rights the Buyer
Indemnified Parties may have against any third party in connection with any
Losses suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties and paid by the Company
Stockholder, and the Buyer Indemnified Party agrees to execute and deliver all
documents and take all other actions reasonably requested by the Company
Stockholder to effect such subrogation; provided, however, that the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall not be required to take any actions that would be
detrimental to the Buyer Indemnified Parties (including, if it would require
any Buyer Indemnified Party to incur any costs, expenses or liabilities, or
if it would require involvement of any past or present Buy-Side Customers or
Sell-Side Customers).

3\. _Limited Release_.

(a) Effective for all purposes as of the Closing, the Company Stockholder, on
behalf of itself and its successors and assigns (each, a " _Releasor_ "),
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases Buyer and its Subsidiaries

obligations, promises, agreements, controversies, damages or causes of action,
suits, rights, demands, costs, losses, debts and expenses (including
attorneys fees and costs incurred) of any nature whatsoever, known or
unknown, suspected or unsuspected, which such Releasor may have as of the
Closing by reason of his, her or its status as a Company Stockholder
(collectively, " _Claims_ "); provided that the foregoing release shall not
cover Claims (i) arising from rights of a Releasor under this Indemnification
and Release, the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Holdback Release Agreement, (ii) of a Releasor who is a director, officer or
employee of Quadrem or any Subsidiary of Quadrem arising under his or her
relationship as such, including any rights to indemnification he or she may
have under any employment agreements with or employee benefit plans or charter
documents of Quadrem or any such subsidiary, or (iii) arising from any
commercial dealings between a Releasor and any Releasee, including with
respect to Releasors status as a Commercial Partner of Releasee and otherwise
under any contracts between a Releasor and any Releasee.

(b) Releasor represents and acknowledges that he, she or it has read this
release and understands its terms and has been given an opportunity to ask

be and remain in effect notwithstanding the discovery or existence of
any such additional or different facts.
