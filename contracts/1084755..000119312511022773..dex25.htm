parties and (i) were not intended to be treated as categorical statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk to the party or parties making the representation and warranty if it proves to be inaccurate; (ii) may have been qualified
in the Stock Purchase Agreement by disclosures that were made to the other party or parties in connection with the negotiation of the Stock Purchase Agreement; (iii) may apply contract standards of &#147;materiality&#148; that are different from
&#147;materiality&#148; under the applicable securities laws; and (iv) were made only as of the date of the Stock Purchase Agreement or such other date or dates as may be specified in the Stock Purchase Agreement. </B></FONT></P>
