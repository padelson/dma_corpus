ii         AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER     This Agreement and
Plan of Merger (this "AGREEMENT") dated as of May 12, 2003, by and among CAC
Holdings Corp. ("PARENT"), a Delaware corporation, Cube Acquisition Corp.
("MERGER SUB"), a Texas corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
and Packaged Ice, Inc. ("COMPANY"), a Texas corporation.   WHEREAS, the
respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
each approved this Agreement and determined that it is advisable and in the
best interest of their respective shareholders that Parent acquire the
Company through the statutory merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company
(the "MERGER") and, in furtherance thereof, have approved the Merger;  
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger all of the Company\'s issued and outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "COMPANY COMMON
STOCK") will be converted into the right to receive cash; and   WHEREAS, the
Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and covenants and
other agreements in connection with the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions hereof, at the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.2), Merger Sub shall merge with and into Company and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to herein as the
"SURVIVING CORPORATION"). The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 5.06 of the Texas Business Corporation Act ("TBCA"), including the
Surviving Corporation\'s succession to and assumption of all rights
and obligations of Merger Sub.   1.2 Effective Time of the Merger. As
promptly as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article VI hereof (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), the parties hereto shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger (the "ARTICLES OF
MERGER") with the Secretary of State of Texas and by making all other filings
or recordings required by the TBCA in connection with the Merger, in such
form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the TBCA. The Merger shall become effective (the "EFFECTIVE
TIME") upon the later of (i) the filing of a properly executed Articles of
Merger relating to the Merger with the Secretary of State of Texas in
accordance with the TBCA, and (ii) at such later time as the parties
shall agree and set forth in such Articles of Merger. On the same day at
which the Effective Time occurs, a closing (the "CLOSING") of the Merger
shall be held at 10:00 a.m. local time, at the New York, New York offices of
Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld, L.L.P. or at such other time and location
as the parties hereto shall otherwise agree.     1    1.3 Articles of
Incorporation. The articles of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation at and after the Effective Time
until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof and the
TBCA.   1.4 Bylaws. The bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation at and
after the Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with the
terms thereof and as provided by the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and the TBCA.   1.5 Directors and Officers. From and
after the Effective Time, until the earlier of their resignation or removal
or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified in accordance with applicable Law, (a) the directors of Merger Sub
at the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation,
and (b) the officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation.   1.6 Conversion of Capital
Stock.   (a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders of any capital stock described
below:   (i) All shares of the Company Common Stock owned by Parent or 
Merger Sub or that are held in Company\'s treasury will be canceled and  no
cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (ii)
Subject to Section 1.6(e) each share of Company Common  Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time  (other than shares of
Company Common Stock canceled pursuant to Section  1.6(a)(i), if any) shall
be canceled and shall, by virtue of the Merger  and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted  automatically into the right to
receive the higher of (A) $3.50, or (B)  the sum of (1) $3.30 plus (2) any
Per Common Share Preferred Discount  (as defined below), payable, without
interest, to the holder of such  share of Company Common Stock, upon
surrender of the certificate that  formerly evidenced such share of Company
Common Stock in the manner  provided in Section 1.6(b) (the "MERGER
CONSIDERATION"). For purposes  of this Agreement, the term "PER COMMON SHARE
PREFERRED DISCOUNT" shall  mean an amount equal to the quotient of (x) the
Optional Redemption  Price for all of the shares of 10% Exchangeable
Preferred Stock, par  value $0.01 per share (the "COMPANY PREFERRED STOCK")
at the Effective  Time less the amount actually paid by the Company to either
redeem or  repurchase such Company Preferred Stock at the Effective Time,
divided  by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding at
the  Effective Time plus the number of shares of Company Common Stock 
underlying Company Options and Warrants (as defined below) with  exercise
prices less than or equal to the per share Merger  Consideration; provided,
however, that if the resulting quotient is a  negative number, the Per Common
Share Preferred Discount shall be zero.     2    (iii) Each share of
common stock of Merger Sub, par value  $0.01 ("MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK"),
issued and outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for  one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of the common  stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each
stock certificate of Merger  Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares
shall from and after the  Effective Time evidence ownership of the same
number of shares of  capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (iv) As
of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common  Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be  cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and from and after the  Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers  effected on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of  shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior  to the Effective Time. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender  of stock certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time  represented any shares of Company
Common Stock ("STOCK CERTIFICATES")  in accordance with the terms hereof
shall be deemed to have been paid  in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Stock  Certificates and shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented  thereby. Each holder of a Stock Certificate shall cease
to have any  rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon
the  surrender of such Stock Certificate as provided in this Section 1.6, 
the applicable per share Merger Consideration in cash, without interest  and
subject to any required tax withholding.   (b) Surrender of the shares of
Company Common Stock and payment of the Merger Consideration shall be
conducted as follows:   (i) Parent shall authorize one or more transfer
agent(s)  reasonably acceptable to Company to act as payment agent hereunder
(the  "EXCHANGE AGENT") with respect to the Merger. At or prior to the 
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit the Merger Consideration with the 
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company  Common
Stock, for payment in accordance with this Section 1.6 through  the Exchange
Agent (the "EXCHANGE FUND"). The Exchange Agent shall,  pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the applicable Merger  Consideration in
exchange for surrendered Stock Certificates pursuant  to Section 1.6 out of
the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by  Section 1.6, the Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose.   (ii) Promptly after the Effective
Time, but in any event not  later than five Business Days (as defined below)
thereafter, Parent  will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to
each holder of  a Stock Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective
Time  represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, a letter of 
transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the exchange of such  Stock
Certificate for the applicable Merger     3    Consideration. Provision
also shall be made for holders of a Stock  Certificate to procure in person,
immediately after the Effective Time,  a letter of transmittal and
instructions and to deliver in person  immediately after the Effective Time
such letter of transmittal and  Stock Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. For  purposes of this Agreement, "BUSINESS DAY" means any date
that is not a  Saturday or Sunday or other day on which banks are required
or  authorized by Law to be closed in New York City.   (iii) After the
Effective Time, Stock Certificates shall  represent the right, upon surrender
thereof to the Exchange Agent,  together with a duly executed and properly
completed letter of  transmittal relating thereto, to receive in exchange
therefor the  Merger Consideration, subject to any required tax withholding,
and the  Stock Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled. No interest
will  be paid or will accrue on any cash amount payable upon the surrender
of  any such Stock Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Stock 
Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes  only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration.   (iv) If cash is to be paid
to a Person other than the  registered holder of the Stock Certificate or
Certificates surrendered  in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to
such payment that the  Stock Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall
be properly  endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that
the  Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any 
transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a  Person
other than the registered holder or establish to the  satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is  not applicable. For
purposes of this Agreement, "PERSON" means an  individual, a corporation, a
limited liability company, a partnership,  an association, a trust or any
other entity or organization, including  a Governmental Authority.   (v)
Any Merger Consideration in the Exchange Fund that remains  unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock one year  after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and  any such holder who has not
exchanged such holder\'s Stock Certificates  in accordance with this Section
1.6 prior to that time shall thereafter  look only to Parent, as a general
creditor thereof, to exchange such  Stock Certificates for the Merger
Consideration to which such holder is  entitled pursuant to Section 1.6. If
outstanding Stock Certificates are  not surrendered prior to six years after
the Effective Time (or, in any  particular case, prior to such earlier date
on which any Merger  Consideration payable in respect of such Stock
Certificates would  otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental unit or  agency), the Merger Consideration issuable or payable
in respect of  such Stock Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable  Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims
or  interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, none of Parent, Company, the Surviving Corporation, the  Exchange
Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any holder of  Stock
Certificates for any amount paid, or Merger Consideration  delivered, to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned  property, escheat or
similar Laws.     4    (vi) If any Stock Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or  destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person  claiming such Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if  required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of
a  bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity  against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such  Stock
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay in exchange for such  lost, stolen
or destroyed Stock Certificate the Merger Consideration in  respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.   (c) Outstanding options to purchase Company
Common Stock shall be  dealt with as follows:   (i) The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to  cause (A) the Compensation Committee of
the Company\'s Board of  Directors (the "BOARD") to exercise its authority
under the Company\'s  2001 Stock Option Plan, as amended, the Company\'s 1998
Stock Option  Plan, as amended, the Company\'s 1994 Stock Option Plan, the
Company\'s  2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and the 2002 Senior
Executive  Restricted Stock Plan (the "COMPANY EQUITY PLANS") to accelerate
the  vesting of, and to cancel, all options and any other awards to acquire 
shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Equity Plans  prior
to the Effective Time (all outstanding options and any other  awards to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock granted under the  Company Equity
Plans being hereinafter referred to as the "COMPANY  OPTIONS").   In
exchange for the cancellation of Company Options, each holder  thereof shall
have the right to receive an amount in each case  determined by multiplying
(A) the excess, if any, of the Merger  Consideration over the applicable
exercise price per share of the  Company Option by (B) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock such  holder could have purchased had such holder
exercised such Company  Option in full immediately prior to the Effective
Time (such amount,  the "OPTION CONSIDERATION"). Upon the Effective Time,
each holder of  Company Options who has had his or her Company Options
canceled in  connection with the Merger shall become entitled to the Option 
Consideration, subject to any required tax withholding, and all rights  of
such holder associated with the Company Options shall be terminated  and
canceled. A Company Option with an exercise price greater than the  per share
Merger Consideration will not be entitled to any  consideration upon exercise
or cancellation of such Company Option as a  result of the Merger. The
Company shall promptly pay or cause to be  paid any amounts withheld for
applicable foreign, federal, state and  local taxes to the appropriate
Governmental Authority on behalf of such  holders of Company Options. The
Company shall use its commercially  reasonable efforts to take all action
required under each of the  Company Equity Plans to cause, as of the
Effective Time, the  termination of each such Company Equity Plan pursuant to
the terms and  conditions of such Company Equity Plan.     5    As of
the Effective Time, all Company Options issued under the  Company\'s Stock
Option Plans that are not exchanged pursuant to this  Section 1.6(c)
immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger  shall terminate and
expire as of the Effective Time or otherwise remain  exercisable only to the
extent that each holder of such Company Options  shall be entitled to the
Option Consideration and such Company Options  shall thereafter be canceled
following their exercise.   (ii) The Board, or an appropriate committee
thereof, shall  take all action necessary so that the exemption from Section
16 under  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE
ACT"))  which is contemplated by Section 16b-3(e) is applicable to the 
disposition of the shares of Company Common Stock and Company Options  in, or
in connection with, the Merger as contemplated by this Agreement  by all
persons who are directors and/or officers of the Company.   (d) At the
Effective Time, each holder of a then-outstanding Company warrant (a
"WARRANT") will be entitled to receive in settlement of such Warrant a cash
payment from the Company equal to the product of (i) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock then subject to such Warrant with an exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock less than the per share
Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the excess of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Warrant, subject to any required withholding of taxes. A
Warrant with an exercise price greater than the per share Merger
Consideration will not be entitled to any consideration upon exercise or
cancellation of such Warrant as a result of the Merger. If necessary or
appropriate under the terms of such Warrant, the Company will, upon the
request of Parent, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
written acknowledgment of each person holding a Warrant that the payment of
the amount of cash referred to above will satisfy in full the Company\'s
obligation to such person pursuant to such Warrant. As of the Effective Time,
all Warrants that are not exchanged pursuant to this Section 1.6(d)
immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger shall terminate
and expire as of the Effective Time or otherwise remain exercisable only to
the extent that each holder of such Warrant shall be entitled to the cash
payment set forth in this Section 1.6(d) and such Warrants shall thereafter
be canceled. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make any amendments to the terms of the Warrants that
are necessary and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Section 1.6(d).   (e) Any shares of Company Common Stock held by a
shareholder of the Company (a "COMPANY SHAREHOLDER") properly exercising its
dissent rights under the TBCA (a "DISSENTING SHAREHOLDER") will be converted
into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due
to such Dissenting Shareholder under Article 5.12 of the TBCA; except that
any such shares that a Dissenting Shareholder holds for which, after the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shareholder withdraws its demand for purchase
or loses its purchase right as provided in the TBCA, will be deemed to be
converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest. Company will give Parent (i) prompt notice
of any written demands for purchase, withdrawals of demands for purchase and
any other instruments served under the TBCA, and (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and     6   proceedings with respect to demands
for purchase under the TBCA. Company will not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any purchase demands and will not, except with Parent\'s
prior written consent, settle or offer to settle any such demands.  
ARTICLE II   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY   Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:   2.1

is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of its state of organization, is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in the jurisdictions set forth in
Section 2.1(a) of the disclosure letter delivered to Parent contemporaneously
with the execution hereof (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE LETTER"), which includes
each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification necessary. Each of Company
and its Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
use or lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Each of Company and its Subsidiaries has made available to Parent
a complete and correct copy of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws
(or similar organizational documents), each as amended to date, and such
copies as so delivered are in full force and effect.   (b) For purposes of
this Agreement, (i) a "COMPANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" shall mean any
change, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts that is materially
adverse to the condition (financial or otherwise), business, properties or
results of operations of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
that could reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of Company
to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Merger;
provided that none of the following, alone or in combination, shall
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect or be considered in determining
whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or will occur: any
change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development arising
directly from (A) adverse changes in the economy in general or (B)
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the announcement thereof;
and (ii) "SUBSIDIARY" shall mean, with respect to any party, any corporation
or other organization whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which (1) at
least a majority of the securities or other interests having by their terms
voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or others
performing similar functions with respect to such corporation or other
organization is directly or indirectly beneficially owned or controlled by
such party or by any one or more of its subsidiaries, or by such party and
one or more of its subsidiaries, or (2) such party or any Subsidiary of such
party is a general partner of a partnership or a manager of a limited
liability company.   2.2 Capitalization.   (a) The authorized capital
stock of Company consists of 50,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, and
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock of Company, par value $.01 per share. As
of May 1, 2003, (i) 20,157,304 shares of Company Common Stock were
issued     7   and outstanding, (ii) 298,231 shares of Company Common
Stock were held in treasury, (iii) 423,175 shares of Company Preferred Stock
were issued and outstanding, with no shares of Company Preferred Stock having
accrued pursuant to the Amended and Restated Preferred Stock Designation for
the Company\'s 10% Exchangeable Preferred Stock, (the "10% PREFERRED
DESIGNATION"), (iv) Warrants to acquire an aggregate of 3,846,049 shares of
Company Common Stock were outstanding under all agreements of Company, with
no Warrants to acquire shares of Company Common Stock having accrued pursuant
to the 10% Preferred Designation, and (iv) stock options to acquire an
aggregate of 1,915,607 shares of Company Common Stock were outstanding under
all stock option plans and agreements of Company. All such outstanding shares
have been validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. Except as set forth above and in Section 2.2(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, and other than in this Agreement and in the 10%
Preferred Designation, which provides for payment of dividends in the form of
additional Company Preferred Stock and Warrants rather than cash, there are
no outstanding subscriptions, options, rights, warrants, convertible
securities, stock appreciation rights, phantom equity, or other agreements or
commitments obligating Company to issue, transfer, sell, redeem, repurchase
or otherwise acquire any shares of its capital stock of any class.   (b)
the Company is, directly or indirectly, the record and beneficial owner of
all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each Company Subsidiary,
there are no proxies with respect to any such shares, and no equity
securities of any Company Subsidiary are or may become required to be issued
because of any options, warrants, rights to subscribe to, calls
or commitments, understandings or other agreements of any character
whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of any capital stock of any Company
Subsidiary. Except as set forth in Section 2.2(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, all of such shares so owned by Company are validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and are owned by it free and clear of all Liens (as defined
herein).   2.3 Authority.   (a) The Company has all necessary corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and, subject to obtaining any necessary Company
shareholder approval (if required by applicable Law) in connection with the
Merger only, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of
this Agreement, and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action (including, without limitation, the
unanimous approval of the non-employee members of the Board) and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (other than, with respect to the Merger only, the approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, as required
by the TBCA). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent
and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other Laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors and of general
principles of equity (the "ENFORCEABILITY EXCEPTION").     8    (b) At
a meeting duly called and held on May 12, 2003, the Board (i) determined that
this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the
Company Shareholders, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (iii) resolved to
recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the
Company Shareholders. Such actions taken by the Board constitute approval
by the Board of the Merger, this Agreement and all other agreements
and transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with all applicable
provisions of the TBCA such that, assuming no change in the Board\'s

requisite corporate power and authority to own, use or lease its properties
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of Parent and

otherwise), business, properties or results of operations of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or that could reasonably be expected to
materially impair the ability of Parent to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or to consummate the Merger; provided that none of the following,
alone or in combination, shall constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
be considered in determining whether a Parent Material Adverse Effect has
occurred or will occur: any change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts

involving or otherwise affecting the Company or  Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries which, if pending on the  date of this Agreement,
would have been required to have been disclosed  pursuant to this Agreement
or which relate to the consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.      27    5.2 No Solicitation of Transactions.   (a)
Company agrees that (i) it and its officers, directors and employees shall
not, (ii) Company Subsidiaries and Company Subsidiaries\' officers, directors
and employees shall not and (iii) it shall not authorize or permit its and
its Subsidiaries\' agents and representatives to, (A) directly or indirectly,
initiate, solicit, participate in, or knowingly encourage or facilitate any
inquiries relating to or the making of any Acquisition Proposal or (B)
directly or indirectly, continue, enter into or engage in any negotiations or
discussions concerning any Acquisition Proposal with, or furnish any
information relating to Company or any Company Subsidiary or provide
access to the properties, books and records or any confidential information
or data of Company or any Company Subsidiary to, any Person relating to an
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prevent Company, the Board or any special committee of
the Board that may be formed (a "SPECIAL COMMITTEE") from, (i) taking and
disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) prior to the Company
Shareholders\' Approval being obtained, providing access to properties, books
and records and providing information or data in response to a request
therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal if the Board or Special Committee receives from the
Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement
on terms substantially similar to those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (except for such changes specifically necessary in order for
Company to be able to comply with its obligations under this Agreement)
(provided that all such written information is also provided on a prior or
substantially concurrent basis to Parent), or (iii) prior to the Company
Shareholders\' Approval being obtained, engaging in any negotiations
or discussions with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal (including Persons with whom the Company has
negotiated with prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement), if
and only to the extent that, in connection with the foregoing clauses (ii)
and (iii), (A) the Board or Special Committee (after consultation with its
independent legal counsel) determines in good faith that such action is
necessary for the Board or Special Committee to comply with its fiduciary
duties to Company\'s Shareholders under applicable law, (B) such Acquisition
Proposal is not subject to any financing contingencies or is, in the good
faith judgment of the Board or Special Committee (after consultation with its
financial advisor), reasonably capable of being financed by such other
Person, and (C) the Board or Special Committee determines in good faith after
consultation with its independent legal counsel and financial advisor (taking
into account among other things the legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal, the Person making the proposal, the likelihood of
consummation and the time to complete such transaction) that such Acquisition
Proposal is reasonably capable of being completed and, if consummated, would
reasonably be expected to result in a transaction more favorable to
Company\'s Shareholders than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
(any such more favorable Acquisition Proposal being referred to in this
Agreement as an "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL").   (b) Neither the Board nor any
Special Committee thereof shall (i) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent) or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent) the recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board or
any      28   such Special Committee of this Agreement or the Merger,
or recommend, or propose publicly to recommend, the approval or adoption of
any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acquisition Proposal made by Parent),
(ii) adopt or approve, or propose publicly to adopt or approve, any
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acquisition Proposal made by Parent),
(iii) cause or permit Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or similar agreement which relates to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 5.2 (a)) or (iv) agree or resolve to take any of the actions
prohibited by clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this sentence, unless the Board
or Special Committee, after consultation with its independent legal counsel,
determines that such action is necessary for such Board or Special Committee
to comply with its fiduciary duty under applicable Law. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 5.2 to the contrary, if, at any time prior to
Company Shareholders\' Approval being obtained, the Board or Special
Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and independent legal counsel, in response to an
Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited and that did not otherwise result
from a breach of Section 5.2, that such proposal is a Superior Proposal,
Company or the Board or Special Committee may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1 (f) provided, however, that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement or enter into an agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal unless, in addition, the Company (1) has provided Parent
written notice that it intends to terminate this Agreement, (2) within a
period of two business days following the delivery of the written notice
referred to in this clause (1) above, if Parent proposes adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, but the Board or Special Committee
determines, in its good faith judgment (after receiving the advice of its
financial advisor and after considering such proposed adjustments and
negotiations relating thereto), that the Agreement, as so proposed to
be adjusted, is not as favorable to the Company\'s shareholders as such
Superior Proposal and (3) at least two business days after the Company has

indemnification thereunder) who are currently covered by the Company\'s

Surviving Corporation will not be required to pay an annual premium therefor
