Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and (ii) approved this Agreement.   B. Buyer, Merger Sub and the
Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and

and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 1.4 Certificate of
Incorporation; By-laws.   (a) The certificate of incorporation of the
Company, as in effect  immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
amended in its  entirety at the Effective Time to read in the form attached
as Exhibit  C hereto, and as so amended, shall be the certificate of
incorporation  of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided by  Law and such certificate of incorporation.   (b) The by-laws
of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to  the Effective Time, shall
be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation,  until thereafter amended as
provided by Law and such by-laws.   SECTION 1.5 Board of Directors and
Officers. The Board of Directors and the officers of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
Board of Directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation,

removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 1.6 Further Assurances. If at any time
after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be
advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other
acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or
confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation, its right,
title or interest in, to or under any of the properties, rights, privileges,
powers, franchises or assets of either the Company or Merger Sub or (b)
otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving
Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their designees shall be
authorized to execute     2   and deliver, in the name and on behalf of
the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and
assurances and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
all such other acts and things necessary, desirable or proper to vest,
perfect or confirm its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
properties, rights, privileges, powers, franchises or assets of the Company
or Merger Sub, as applicable, and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.   ARTICLE II  EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; CONSIDERATION   SECTION
2.1 Conversion of Company Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub, Buyer,
the Stockholders, the Warrant Holders or the Option Holders:   (a) Each
share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and  outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted  into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share  of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation;   (b) Each share of Common Stock, together with the related
Right  attached thereto, that is owned by (i) the Company as treasury
stock,  (ii) Buyer, (iii) Merger Sub, (iv) any other wholly owned Subsidiary
of  Buyer or (v) any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, shall be 
canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution  shall
be made with respect thereto;   (c) Except as otherwise provided in clause
(b) above and subject  to Section 2.4, each share of Common Stock outstanding
immediately  prior to the Effective Time, together with the related Right
attached  thereto, shall be converted into the right to receive $1.92 in
cash,  payable to the holder thereof, without interest (the "Common Stock 
Consideration"). All shares of Common Stock converted into the right to 
receive the Common Stock Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c)  shall
cease to be outstanding, and shall be cancelled and retired and  shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate which  immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented shares of Common  Stock shall thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect to such  shares, except the right to receive the
Common Stock Consideration to  be issued in consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such  certificate;   (d) Each Warrant issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive a sum in  cash equal to such Warrant\'s Warrant Cancellation Payment,
without  interest, and all such Warrants shall no longer be outstanding and 
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each  former
Warrant Holder shall cease to have any rights with respect  thereto, other
than the right to receive the consideration set forth  herein. The Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to  take all actions necessary
to effectuate the foregoing. Any payments  made pursuant to this Section
2.1(d) shall be net of all applicable  withholding taxes, which shall be
properly and timely remitted to the  appropriate Governmental Entity;    
3    (e) Each Option issued and outstanding immediately prior to the 
Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable, shall be converted  into the
right to receive, on or as soon as practicable following the  Closing Date, a
sum in cash equal to such Option\'s Option Cancellation  Payment, without
interest, and all such Options shall no longer be  outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to  exist, and each former Option
Holder shall cease to have any rights  with respect thereto, other than the
right to receive the consideration  set forth herein. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in  this Agreement, if the exercise price
per share of Common Stock of any  Option is equal to or greater than the
Common Stock Consideration, such  Option shall be cancelled without any cash
payment being made in  respect thereof. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable  efforts to take all actions necessary to effectuate
the foregoing. Any  payments made pursuant to this Section 2.1(e) shall be
net of all  applicable withholding taxes, which shall be properly and
timely  remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity. As of the
Effective  Time, the Option Plans shall terminate and all rights under any 
provision of any other plan, program or arrangement of the Company or  any
Subsidiary of the Company providing for the issuance or grant of  any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or  any Subsidiary of
the Company shall be cancelled; and   (f) The restrictions on each share of
Restricted Stock shall  lapse immediately prior to, and effective upon the
occurrence of, the  Effective Time, and each share of Restricted Stock shall
be fully  vested in each holder thereof at such time, and each such share
of  Restricted Stock will be treated at the Effective Time the same as, and 
have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions (including  the
conditions set forth in Section 2.2) hereunder as, each share of  Common
Stock not subject to any restrictions as provided in Section  2.1.  
SECTION 2.2 Exchange Procedures.   (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer
shall appoint the Paying  Agent to act as agent for the holders of shares of
Common Stock and  Warrants in connection with the Merger and to receive the
funds to  which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this Article
II.   (b) Promptly following the Effective Time, the Surviving  Corporation
shall cause to be mailed, or otherwise make available, to  each holder of
record of Certificates entitled to receive consideration  pursuant to Section
2.1 the form of Letter of Transmittal. After the  Effective Time, each holder
of certificates or other instruments  formerly evidencing shares of Common
Stock or Warrants (the  "Certificates"), upon surrender of such Certificates
to the Paying  Agent, together with a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal and  such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Paying Agent,  shall be entitled to receive from the Paying Agent, in
exchange  therefor, the aggregate consideration for such shares of Common
Stock  or Warrants, as the case may be, in cash as contemplated by this 
Agreement, and the Certificates so surrendered shall be cancelled. The 
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and Buyer shall be entitled to 
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant  to
this Agreement to any holder of shares of Common Stock or Warrants,  as the
case may be,     4    such amounts as the Surviving Corporation, the
Paying Agent or  Buyer is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the  making of such payment under any provision of applicable Tax Law.  To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving  Corporation, the
Paying Agent or Buyer, such withheld amounts  shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having  been paid to the holder of the shares
of Common Stock or  Warrants, as the case may be, in respect of which such
deduction  and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, the
Paying  Agent or Buyer, as the case may be, and the Surviving  Corporation,
the Paying Agent or Buyer, as applicable, shall  properly and timely remit
any such withheld amounts to the  appropriate Governmental Entity. Until
surrendered as  contemplated by this Section 2.2 (other than Certificates 
representing Dissenting Shares), each Certificate shall be deemed  at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right  to receive the
aggregate consideration for such shares of Common  Stock or Warrants, as the
case may be, in cash as contemplated by  this Agreement, without interest
thereon. All cash consideration  delivered upon the surrender of Certificates
in accordance with  the terms of this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to have
been paid  in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to shares of
Common  Stock and Warrants theretofore represented by such Certificates.  
(c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,  upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming  such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by  the Buyer, the posting
by such Person of a bond or other surety in such  amount as the Buyer may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any  claim that may be made with
respect to such Certificate and subject to  such other reasonable conditions
as the Buyer may impose, the Paying  Agent shall deliver in exchange for such
Certificate the consideration  into which shares of Common Stock or Warrants
theretofore represented  by such Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to this Article  II.   (d) If any payment under this Article II is
to be made to a  Person other than the Person in whose name any Certificate
surrendered  in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment  that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or 
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting  such
payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by  reason of
the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of  the Certificate
surrendered or such Person shall establish to the  satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been  paid or are not
applicable.   (e) None of Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation
shall  be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public 
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or  similar
Law. At any time following the expiration of one (1) year after  the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, in its sole  discretion, be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it  any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) which  had been made available to
the Paying Agent and which have not been  disbursed to holders of
Certificates, and such funds shall thereafter  become the property of the
Surviving Corporation. Such funds may be  commingled with the general funds
of the Surviving Corporation and  shall be free and clear of any claims or
interests of any Person.  Thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look
to the     5    Surviving Corporation (subject to any applicable
abandoned  property, escheat or similar Law) only as general creditors 
thereof with respect to the applicable consideration payable as  contemplated
by this Agreement (net of any amounts that would be  subject to withholding)
upon due surrender of their Certificates,  without any interest thereon.  
(f) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the  Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of  transfer in the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of  the shares of Common Stock,
Warrants or Options, as the case may be,  that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If,  after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving  Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled  and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.2.  
(g) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, the  Surviving
Corporation shall, in exchange for the Options that became  entitled to
receive the consideration specified in Section 2.1, make  the Option
Cancellation Payment in respect of each such Option to each  Option Holder.
The Surviving Corporation and Buyer shall be entitled to  deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant  to this Agreement to any
Option Holder such amounts as the Surviving  Corporation or Buyer is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to  the making of such payment under any
provision of applicable Tax Law or  with respect to the making of other
payments hereunder in connection  with other equity interests in the Company
held by such Option Holder  (provided that such amounts have not been
previously deducted and  withheld). To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving  Corporation or Buyer, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all  purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Option Holder in  respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the  Surviving Corporation or Buyer, as the case may be, and the Surviving 
Corporation or Buyer, as applicable, shall properly and timely remit  any
such withheld amounts to the appropriate Governmental Entity.   SECTION 2.3
Deposit at Closing. At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Paying Agent, for exchange and payment in accordance with
this Article II, an amount equal to the sum of (x) the aggregate Common Stock
Consideration and (y) the aggregate Warrant Cancellation Payments. The Paying
Agent shall invest funds held by it for purposes of this Article II as
directed by Buyer, on a daily basis. Any interest or other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Buyer.   SECTION 2.4
Dissenting Shares.   (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the  contrary, shares of the Company\'s capital stock that are outstanding 
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders  who
shall not have voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in  writing
and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for  such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively,  the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the  right to receive the
consideration set forth in Section 2.1. Such  holders shall be entitled to
receive such consideration as is  determined to be due with respect to such
Dissenting Shares in    6    accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL, except that  all Dissenting Shares held by holders who shall
have failed to perfect  or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their
rights to  appraisal of such shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall
thereupon  be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable  for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
consideration  specified in Section 2.1, without any interest thereon, upon
surrender,  in the manner provided in Section 2.2, of the certificate or 
certificates that formerly evidenced such Dissenting Shares.   (b) The
Company shall give Buyer (i) prompt written notice of any  demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such  demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and  received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all  negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal  under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written  consent of Buyer, make any payment with respect to any demands
for  appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.   ARTICLE
III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as set forth in
the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company prior to, or concurrently
with, the execution of this Agreement (the "Disclosure Schedule"), which
Disclosure Schedule identifies the Section (or, if applicable, subsection) to
which such exception relates, the Company hereby represents and warrants to

Power. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now being conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which such qualification or licensing is necessary because of
the property and assets owned, leased or operated by it or because of the
nature of its business as now being conducted, except for any failure to so
qualify or be licensed or in good standing which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedule lists the
jurisdictions of incorporation and foreign qualifications of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries. The Company has made available to Buyer true,
complete and correct copies of the constitutive documents of each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date of this

Schedule contains a true and correct list of the directors and officers of
each of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date of this
Agreement.   SECTION 3.2 Authority; Approvals.   (a) The execution,

7    corporate powers and authority and have been duly and validly 
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company 
(other than the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company 
Stockholders). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and 
delivered by the Company, and (assuming due authorization, execution  and
delivery by Buyer and Merger Sub) constitutes the valid and binding 
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in  accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited  by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar  laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditor\'s  rights generally and by
the application of general principles of  equity.   (b) The Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Company Board")  has unanimously (i)
determined that this Agreement and the Merger are  fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Company and its  stockholders, (ii) resolved that the
Merger is fair to, and in the  bests interests of, the Company and its
stockholders and declared this  Agreement and the Merger to be advisable,

the Company\'s  stockholders adopt this Agreement, and, as of the date
hereof, none of  the aforesaid actions by the Board of Directors of the
Company has been  amended, rescinded or modified.   (c) The affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of  outstanding shares of Common Stock (the
"Required Company  Stockholders") is the only vote of the holders of any
class or series  of the Company\'s capital stock necessary to approve the
Merger.   SECTION 3.3 Capitalization; Equity Interests.   (a) The
authorized capital stock of the Company consists of  1,000,000,000 shares of
Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred  stock, par value $0.001 per
share (the "Preferred Stock"). As of the  date of this Agreement, (i)

(ii) 29,021 shares of Common  Stock are held in the treasury of the Company,
(iii) no shares of  Common Stock are held by Subsidiaries of the Company and
(iv) no shares  of Preferred Stock are outstanding.   (b) Section 3.3(b) of
the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true  and correct list of all of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries, together with  their respective authorized capital
stock, number of shares issued and  outstanding and record ownership of such
shares. Except as set forth in  Section 3.3(b) of the Disclosure Schedule,
the Company does not have  any Subsidiaries or own or hold, directly or
indirectly, any equity or  other security interest, or has made any
investment, in any other  Person. Except as set forth in Section 3.3(b) of
the Disclosure  Schedule, all issued and outstanding shares of capital stock
of the  Company\'s Subsidiaries have been duly authorized, were validly
issued,  are fully paid and nonassessable and subject to no preemptive
rights  and are directly or indirectly owned beneficially and of record by
the  Company, free and clear of all Encumbrances, and free of any other 
limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right to  vote,
sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock).    8     (c) Except
for (i) issued and outstanding Common Stock referenced  in Sections 3.3(a)(i)
and 3.3(a)(ii), (ii) 20,129,457 shares of Common  Stock reserved for issuance

and other documents required to be filed by it  since January 1, 2003
(together      10     with all exhibits and schedules thereto and all
information  incorporated therein by reference, the "Company SEC Reports").
The  Company SEC Reports, as of the date filed with the SEC (and, in the 
case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of 
effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively, and, in the case  of
any Company SEC Report amended or superseded by a filing prior to  the date

a material fact required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light  of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading and  (ii) complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act")  and the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the
applicable rules  and regulations of the SEC thereunder. None of the
Company\'s  Subsidiaries is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of
the  Exchange Act or required to file any form, report or other document 
with the SEC, the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.\'s National Market or any 
national stock exchange. The Company has made available to Buyer true, 
correct and complete copies of all correspondence with the SEC  occurring
since January 1, 2003 and prior to the date hereof and will,  promptly
following the receipt thereof, make available to Buyer any  such
correspondence sent or received after the date hereof. To the  Company\'s
knowledge, as of the date hereof none of the Company SEC  Reports is the
subject of ongoing SEC review.   (b) The consolidated financial statements
of the Company included  or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC
Reports, as of the date  filed with the SEC (and, in the case of registration
statements and  proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates

amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement,  then
on the date of such amending or superseding filing), complied with 
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and 
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in  accordance
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods  indicated (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the  case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC),  and fairly presented, in
all material respects (subject, in the case of  the unaudited statements, to
normal, recurring audit adjustments not  material in amount), the
consolidated financial position of the Company  and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the date of such financial  statements and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash  flows for each of the
periods then ended. The books and records of the  Company and its
Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in  accordance with GAAP
and all other applicable legal and accounting  requirements and reflect only
actual transactions.   (c) Except as reflected in the consolidated balance
sheet of the  Company and its Subsidiaries at December 31, 2005, which
balance sheet  was filed with the SEC by the Company on March 1, 2006 in its
2005  Annual Report on Form 10-K and made available to Buyer, the Company
and  its Subsidiaries do not have, and as a result of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, will not have, any liabilities or 
obligations (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise, and  whether
due or to become due), except for liabilities and obligations  incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent     11     with past
practice since December 31, 2005 which, individually or in  the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company  Material Adverse
Effect.   SECTION 3.6 Disclosure Documents. None of the information included
or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement (including any amendments
or supplements thereto) will, on the date the Proxy Statement is filed with
the SEC or on the date mailed to the Company\'s shareholders or at the time
immediately following any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or
at the time the Company Stockholders\' Meeting is held, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading;
provided that the Company makes no representations regarding any information
furnished in writing by Buyer or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement.   SECTION 3.7 Absence of Changes. Except as set forth in
Section 3.7 of the Disclosure Schedule, since December 31, 2005, the Company
and its Subsidiaries have been operated in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice and there has not been (i) any Company Material Adverse
Effect or (ii) any action taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries that, if
taken during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective
Time, would constitute a breach of Section 5.1(b).   SECTION 3.8 Assets and
Properties; Network.   (a) Section 3.8(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a true  and complete list of all real property owned or leased by the
Company  or any of its Subsidiaries, including all collocation agreements
to  which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. Except as set 
forth in Section 3.8(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company  and
its Subsidiaries has good fee simple title to, or a valid leasehold  interest
in, as applicable, all of its owned or leased real property,  including all
such property interests identified in Section 3.8(a) of  the Disclosure
Schedule (including all rights, title, privileges and  appurtenances
pertaining or relating thereto) free and clear of any and  all Encumbrances,
except for defects in title or failures to be in full  force and effect
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not  reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All  leases, including all
collocation agreements to which the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, in respect of real property leased  by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries are in full force and effect,  neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any  written notice of a breach or default
thereunder, and to the Company\'s  knowledge, no event has occurred that,
with notice or lapse of time or  both, would constitute a breach or default
thereunder, except for such  breach or default that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not  reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   (b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has good
title to,  or a valid leasehold interest in, as applicable, all personal
property  used in their respective businesses, except for defects in title
or  failures to be in full force and effect which, individually or in the 
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material 
Adverse Effect. Such personal property and the structural elements of 
the     12    owned and leased property (taken as a whole) are in good
operating  condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear and deferred
maintenance  excepted, and except for such failures to be in good operating 
condition and repair which, individually or in the aggregate, would not 
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (c)
Section 3.8(c) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the  following
information relating to the network of the Company and its  Subsidiaries: (i)
all switches and switch locations of the Company and  its Subsidiaries, (ii)
all material inventory of the Company and its  Subsidiaries, (iii) a
description of fibers and fiber miles owned or  leased by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (iv) for the ATM/IP  backbone of the Company and its

payments in  excess of $100,000 in any one year. The information provided in
Section  3.8(c) of the Disclosure Schedule is accurate and complete in all 
material respects; provided, however, that the operation of the network  of
the Company and its Subsidiaries is subject to embedded software  owned by
third parties and licensed to the Company or its Subsidiaries,  as to which
(unless indicated otherwise in Section 3.8(c) of the  Disclosure Schedule)
the Company has valid licenses as of the date  hereof. The Company shall
provide Buyer with correct and complete  copies of all leases with respect to
the network of the Company and its  Subsidiaries. Each of the network
facilities described in Section  3.8(c) of the Disclosure Schedule is in good
operating condition and  repair, ordinary wear and tear and deferred
maintenance excepted, and  except for such failures to be in good operating
condition and repair  which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be  expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.  
SECTION 3.9 Other Agreements.   (a) Section 3.9(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true,  correct and complete list, as of the date of
this Agreement, of each  contract, agreement, commitment or lease of the
Company and its  Subsidiaries currently in effect (i) which by its terms is a
"material  contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of
Regulation S-K  of the SEC), (ii) that materially restricts the conduct of
any material  line of business by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
the  ability of any such Person to operate in any geographic area, (iii) 
relating to the borrowing of money or any guarantee in respect of any 
indebtedness in excess of $100,000 of any Person (other than any  guarantee
made by the Company in respect of any real property or  personal property
leased by any Subsidiary), (iv) that extends "most  favored nations" or
similar pricing to the counterparty to such  contract and such contract
involving aggregate payments in excess of  $100,000 per year, (v) with
respect to employment of an officer or  director, (vi) with respect to
engagement of a consultant involving  payments of more than $100,000 in any
one year, or (vii) that restricts  the ability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to consummate the  transactions contemplated hereby on a timely
basis. In addition,  Section 3.9(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true, correct  and complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of each 
interconnection agreement to which the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries is
a party. Each contract, agreement, commitment or lease  of the type described
in this Section 3.9(a), whether or not set forth  in Section 3.9(a) of
the     13    Disclosure Schedule, is referred to herein as a "Material
Contract".  True, correct and complete copies of all Material Contracts
have  previously been made available to Buyer.   (b) All of the Material
Contracts are in full force and effect,  except where the failure to be in
full force and effect, individually  or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company  Material Adverse Effect, and all
are enforceable against the Company or  its applicable Subsidiary and, to the
knowledge of the Company, the  other parties thereto in accordance with its
terms, except as such  enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency,  reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general 
applicability relating to or affecting creditor\'s rights generally and  by
the application of general principles of equity. Neither the Company  nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any  other party to
such Material Contracts is in breach of or default under  any obligation
thereunder or has given notice of default to any other  party thereunder and,
to the knowledge of the Company, no condition  exists that with notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute a  default thereunder, in each case
which breach or default, individually  or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to have a Company  Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.10
Environmental Matters. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries holds all
licenses, permits and other governmental authorizations required under all
applicable Environmental Laws, except for such licenses, permits and other
governmental authorizations the failure to hold which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation of any requirements of any Environmental Laws in connection
with the conduct of its business or in connection with the use, maintenance
or operation of any real property owned or leased by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, except for violations which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. To the Company\'s knowledge, there are no conditions relating
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or relating to any real property
owned or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries currently or during
the last five years that in any such case would reasonably be expected to
lead to any material liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under any Environmental Law.   SECTION 3.11 Litigation. Except as set forth
in Section 3.11 of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no actions, suits,
proceedings, arbitrations, claims or disputes pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened by or before any court, arbitration tribunal or other
Governmental Entity against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which
bring into question the validity of this Agreement or that, individually or
in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger. No
injunction, writ, temporary restraining order, decree or any order of any
nature has been issued by any court or other Governmental Entity relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or seeking or purporting to enjoin or
restrain the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice of any condemnation or eminent domain proceeding affecting any
owned or leased real property, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no such
action or proceeding has been threatened.      14    SECTION 3.12
Compliance; Licenses and Permits.   (a) Except as set forth in Section
3.12(a) of the Disclosure  Schedule, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
is in compliance  with all Laws applicable to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or  their respective businesses (including without limitation,
(i) the  Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the communications-
related  statutes of each state in which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries  operates; (ii) the rules, regulations, orders, and policies of
the FCC  and State PUCs, (iii) any and all Universal Service Fund
obligations,  and (iv) the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act),
except  for failures to comply which, individually or in the aggregate,
would  not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries holds all federal, 
state, local and foreign governmental approvals, authorizations, 
certificates, filings, franchises, licenses, notices, permits and  rights
(collectively, "Permits," a true, correct and complete list of  which is
contained in Section 3.12(b) of the Disclosure Schedule) that  are necessary
to conduct their respective businesses as presently being  conducted, except
for such Permits the failure to hold which,  individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to  have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section  3.12(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule, (i) such Permits are in full force  and effect, (ii) no material
violations are or have been alleged in  respect of any thereof, (iii) no
proceeding is pending or, to the  knowledge of the Company, threatened,
against the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries in connection with the right
to operate under the Permits,  or that could reasonably result in any fines,
penalties or other losses  in excess of $50,000 individually or $250,000 in
the aggregate, and  (iv) the consummation of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement will not result in the non-renewal,
revocation or  termination of any such Permit.   (c) The Company and its
Subsidiaries are the authorized legal  holders or otherwise have rights to
all Permits issued by the FCC,  State PUCs or any other Governmental Entity
that regulates  telecommunications in each applicable jurisdiction held by
the Company  or its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Communications Licenses," a
true,  correct and complete list of which is contained in Section 3.12(c)
of  the Disclosure Schedule), and the Communications Licenses constitute 
all of the licenses from the FCC, the State PUCs or any other  Governmental
Entity that regulates telecommunications in each  applicable jurisdiction
that are necessary or required for the  operation of the businesses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as now  conducted other than any such licenses
from any Municipal Franchising  Authority the absence of which would not
result in any fines, penalties  or other losses in excess of $50,000
individually or $250,000, in the  aggregate. All the Communications Licenses
were duly obtained and are  valid and in full force and effect, unimpaired by
any material  condition, except those conditions that may be contained within
the  terms of such Communications Licenses. As of the date of this 
Agreement, no action by or before the FCC, any State PUC or any other 
Governmental Entity that regulates telecommunications in each  applicable
jurisdiction is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,  threatened in
which the requested remedy is (i) the revocation,  suspension, cancellation,
rescission or modification or refusal to  renew any of the Communications
Licenses, or (ii) material fines and/or  forfeitures. As     15    of
the date of this Agreement, the Universal Service Administration  Company has
not initiated any inquiries, audits or other proceedings  against the Company
or its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the  Company, no such actions
are threatened which, in each case, could  result in fines, penalties or
other losses in excess of $50,000  individually or $250,000, in the
aggregate, if not cured or otherwise  responded to in the ordinary course of
business.   (d) The Company and each of its officers and directors are in 
compliance with, and have complied, in all material respects with (i)  the
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the  related
rules and regulations promulgated under such Act (the  "Sarbanes-Oxley Act")
or the Exchange Act and (ii) the applicable  listing and corporate governance
rules and regulations of the American  Stock Exchange. There are no
outstanding loans made by the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries to any
executive officer (as defined in Rule  3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or
director of the Company. Since the  enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries has made any loans to any
executive officer or director of  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Company has established and  maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
such term is defined  in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and such
disclosure controls  and procedures are designed to ensure that all material
information  relating to the Company, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is  made known on a timely basis to the Company\'s principal
executive  officer and its principal financial officer by others within
those  entities. The Company\'s principal executive officer and its
principal  financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent 
evaluation, to the Company\'s auditors and the audit committee of the  Board
of Directors of the Company (i) all significant deficiencies in  the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting  which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect  the Company\'s
ability to record, process, summarize and report  financial data and have
identified for the Company\'s auditors any  material weaknesses in internal
controls over financial reporting and  (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or  other employees who have a significant
role in the Company\'s internal  controls over financial reporting. For
purposes of this paragraph,  "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall  have the meanings given to such terms in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.   SECTION 3.13 Intellectual Property.   (a) Section
3.13(a)(1) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth an  accurate and complete
list of all registered Marks owned (in whole or  in part) by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (collectively  "Company Registered Marks"), Section
3.13(a)(2) of the Disclosure  Schedule sets forth an accurate and complete
list of all registered  Patents or pending applications for registered
Patents owned (in whole  or in part) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively the  "Company Registered Patents") and Section
3.13(a)(3) of the Disclosure  Schedule sets forth an accurate and complete
list of all registered  Copyrights owned (in whole or in part) by the Company
or any of its  Subsidiaries, and all pending applications for registration
of  Copyrights filed anywhere in the world that are owned (in whole or in 
part) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively the  "Company
Registered Copyrights" and, together with the Company     16   
Registered Marks and the Company Registered Patents, the "Company  Registered
IP"). Except as set forth on Section 3.13(a)(4) of the  Disclosure Schedule,
no Company Registered IP has been or is now  involved in any interference,
reissue, reexamination, opposition,  cancellation or similar proceeding and,
to the knowledge of the  Company, no such action is or has been threatened in
writing with  respect to any of the Company Registered IP. To the knowledge
of the  Company, the Company Registered IP is valid, subsisting and 
enforceable, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has 
received any written notice or claim challenging or questioning the  validity
or enforceability or alleging the misuse of any of the Company  Registered
IP. Except as may be set forth in Section 3.13(a)(5) of the  Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries has
taken any action or failed to take any action, which  action or failure
reasonably could be expected to result in the  abandonment, cancellation,
forfeiture, relinquishment, invalidation or  unenforceability of any of the
Company Registered IP except for such  actions or failures which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not  reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has taken all  reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality
of all information  that constitutes a material Trade Secret of the Company
or any of its  Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, all  current and former employees, consultants and contractors of
the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries who have participated in the 
creation of any material Intellectual Property that is used by the  Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in the conduct of their respective  businesses
have entered into proprietary information, confidentiality  and assignment
agreements with the Company that are substantially in  the Company\'s
standard forms (which have previously been provided to  Buyer).   (c) To
the knowledge of the Company, the Company owns exclusively  all right, title
and interest to the Company Registered IP and all  other material
Intellectual Property used by the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries that is
not licensed to the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries pursuant to a written
license agreement, free and clear of  any Lien or other adverse claims or
interests, and neither the Company  nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
any written notice or claim  challenging the Company\'s or such Subsidiary\'s
ownership of any of such  material Intellectual Property. None of such
material Intellectual  Property owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject  to any outstanding order, judgment, or stipulation
restricting the use  thereof by the Company or such Subsidiary.   (d)
Section 3.13(d)(1) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a  complete and
accurate list of all material agreements granting to the  Company or any of
its Subsidiaries any material right under or with  respect to any
Intellectual Property owned by a third party that is  used in connection with
the business of the Company or any such  Subsidiary other than commercially
available standard Software  applications used in the Company\'s or any such
Subsidiary\'s operations  (collectively, the "Inbound License Agreements"),
indicating for each  the title and the parties thereto. Section 3.13(d)(2) of
the Company  Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of
all  material license agreements under which the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries grants any rights under     17    any Intellectual
Property, excluding non-exclusive licenses granted by  the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of  business in substantially the
Company\'s standard forms (which have  previously been provided to Buyer). No
loss or expiration of any  material Intellectual Property licensed to the
Company or any of its  Subsidiaries under any Inbound License Agreement is

obligations of the parties thereunder. The  execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement,  and the consummation of the

of, or give rise to any right of any  third party to terminate or reprice or
otherwise modify any of the  Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' rights
or obligations under any  Inbound License Agreement or any Outbound License

commercially exploited by or for the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
infringed upon, misappropriated,  or violated, or does infringe upon,
misappropriate or violate any  Intellectual Property of any third party.
Neither the Company nor any  of its Subsidiaries has received any written
notice or claim asserting  that any such material infringement,

which should be  described in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the  Company shall inform Buyer promptly after becoming aware of
such event.  Whenever the Company learns of the occurrence of any event which
should  be described in an amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy
Statement,  the parties shall cooperate to promptly cause such amendment or 
supplement to be prepared, filed with and cleared by the SEC and, if 
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the persons and in the  manner
required.     28    SECTION 5.4 Company Stockholders\' Meeting. The
Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders\' Meeting")
for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement; provided that
the Proxy Statement shall be mailed to Company stockholders no later than ten
(10) Business Days after the SEC has indicated that it has no further
comments to the Proxy Statement. Subject to Sections 5.5(b), the Company
shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders adoption
of this Agreement and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company\'s
obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.4 shall not be
affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Takeover Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal
or modification by the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof of such Board of Directors\' or such committee\'s approval or
recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 5.5 Acquisition
Proposals.   (a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, 
Subsidiaries, and its and each of their respective officers, directors, 
employees, consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and  other
advisors, representatives and agents (collectively,  "Representatives") to,
immediately cease and cause to be immediately  terminated any discussions or
negotiations with any parties that may be  ongoing with respect to, or that
are intended to or could reasonably be  expected to lead to, a Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall not, and  shall cause its Affiliates,
Subsidiaries and its and their respective  Representatives not to, (i)
directly or indirectly solicit, initiate,  encourage or take any other action
to facilitate (including by way of  furnishing or disclosing information) any
Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter  into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding with respect to any  Takeover Proposal (including any letter of
intent, memorandum of  understanding or agreement in principle) or enter into
any agreement,  arrangement or understanding (including any letter of
intent,  memorandum of understanding or agreement in principle) which
requires,  or is intended to or which could reasonably be expected to result
in,  the abandonment, termination or the failure to consummate the Merger
or  any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) initiate or 
participate in any way in any negotiations or discussions regarding, or 
furnish or disclose to any Person (other than a party to this  Agreement) any
information with respect to any Takeover Proposal or  (iv) grant any waiver
or release under any standstill or any similar  agreement with respect to any
class of the Company\'s equity securities;  provided, however, that at any
time prior to the adoption of this  Agreement by the Required Company
Stockholders, in response to a bona  fide written unsolicited Takeover
Proposal received after the date  hereof that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good  faith (after consultation with outside counsel
and a financial advisor  of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes, or
would reasonably  be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and which
Takeover  Proposal was not, directly or indirectly, the result of a breach
of  this Section 5.5, the Company may, if its Board of Directors determines 
in good faith (after consulting with a financial advisor of nationally 
recognized reputation and outside counsel) that it is required to do so  in
order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the  Company
under applicable Law, and subject to compliance with    29    Section
5.5(b), (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and  its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its 
representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not  less
restrictive of such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement;  provided that
all such information has previously been provided to  Buyer or is provided to
Buyer prior to or concurrently with the time it  is provided to such Person,
and (y) participate in discussions or  negotiations with the Person making
such Takeover Proposal (and its  representatives) regarding such Takeover
Proposal.   (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any 
committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse  to
Buyer), or propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to  Buyer), the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by  such Board of
Directors or any such committee thereof of, this  Agreement, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this  Agreement or (B) recommend,
adopt or approve, or propose to recommend,  adopt or approve, any Takeover
Proposal (any action described in this  clause (i) being referred to as a
"Company Adverse Recommendation  Change") or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or  recommend, or allow the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute  or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding,  agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option  agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other  agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or
would  reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than
a  confidentiality agreement referred to in and as permitted by Section 
5.5(a)) (an "Acquisition Agreement") or which is intended to or which  could
reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment, termination  or failure
to consummate the Merger or any other transaction  contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any  time prior to the adoption
of this Agreement by the Required Company  Stockholders, the Board of
Directors of the Company may make a Company  Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to a Superior Proposal if  such Board of Directors determines in
good faith (after consultation  with outside counsel and a financial advisor
of nationally recognized  reputation) that it is required to do so in order
to comply with its  fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable  Law; provided, however, that (i) no such Company Adverse
Recommendation  Change may be made if the Company failed to comply with this
Section  5.5, (ii) no such Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall be
made  until after the third (3rd) Business Day following Buyer\'s receipt
of  written notice (a "Notice of Adverse Recommendation") from the Company 
advising Buyer that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to  take
such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the  terms and
conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the  proposed action
by the Board of Directors (it being understood and  agreed that any amendment
to the financial terms or any other material  term of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new Notice of Adverse  Recommendation and a new three (3)
Business Day period) and  representing that the Company has complied with
this Section 5.5, (iii)  during such three (3) Business Day period, the
Company shall negotiate  with Buyer in good faith to make such adjustments to
the terms and  conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to
proceed  with its recommendation of this Agreement and not make a Company 
Adverse Recommendation Change and (iv) the Company shall not make a  Company
Adverse     30    Recommendation Change if, prior to the expiration of
such three (3)  Business Day period, Buyer makes a proposal to adjust the
terms and  conditions of this Agreement that the Company\'s Board of
Directors  determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial 
advisors) to be at least as favorable as the Superior Proposal after  giving
effect to, among other things, the payment of the Termination  Fee set forth
in Section 7.3 hereof.   (c) The Company agrees that in addition to the
obligations of the  Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
Section 5.5,  promptly on the date of receipt thereof, the Company shall
advise Buyer  orally and in writing of any request for information or any
Takeover  Proposal, or any inquiry, discussions or negotiations with respect
to  any Takeover Proposal and the terms and conditions of such request, 
Takeover Proposal, inquiry, discussions or negotiations (including the 
identity of the Person making such Takeover Proposal) and the Company  shall
promptly provide to Buyer copies of any written materials  received by the
Company in connection with any of the foregoing, and  the identity of the
Person or group making any such request, Takeover  Proposal or inquiry or
with whom any discussions or negotiations are  taking place; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be required  to disclose the identity of
the Person or group making such request,  Takeover Proposal, inquiry or with
whom any discussions or negotiations  are taking place to the extent that the
Company is prohibited from  making such disclosure pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement entered  into prior to the date of this Agreement.
The Company agrees that it  shall keep Buyer fully informed of the status and
details (including  amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request,
Takeover  Proposal or inquiry and keep Buyer fully informed as to the details
of  any information requested of or provided by the Company and as to the 
details of all discussions or negotiations with respect to any such  request,
Takeover Proposal or inquiry.   (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.5
shall prohibit the  Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position  contemplated by Rule 14e-2 or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange  Act; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or its
Board  of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to 
take, any action prohibited by Section 5.5(b).   SECTION 5.6 Reasonable
Efforts; Further Assurances.   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in  this Agreement, including, without limitation,
Section 5.6(b) hereof,  each of the parties hereto will use all commercially
reasonable efforts  to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be  done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Laws  to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement as expeditiously as practicable and to ensure that the 
conditions set forth in Article VI are satisfied, insofar as such  matters
are within the control of any of them, including, without  limitation, (i)
making the requisite filings pursuant to the HSR Act,  (ii) making all
necessary notifications required by and filing all  necessary applications
with the FCC seeking the consent of the FCC to  the transfer of the Permits
and Communications Licenses issued by the  FCC to the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries in connection    31    with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement (the "FCC Consents") and (iii)
making all necessary  notifications required by and filing all necessary
applications with  the State PUCs seeking the consent of the applicable State
PUC to the  assignment of the Permits and Communications Licenses issued or
granted  by such State PUC to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in 
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by  this
Agreement (the "State PUC Consents"); and (iii) making all  necessary
notifications required by and filing all necessary  applications with each
Municipal Franchising Authority seeking the  consent of the Municipal
Franchising Authority to the transfer of the  Permits and Communications
Licenses issued by the Municipal Franchising  Authority to the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries in connection  with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement (the "Municipal Franchising
Authority Consents"). Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject to Section 5.2,  the Company, on the one hand, and Buyer and Merger
Sub, on the other  hand, shall each furnish to the other such necessary
information and  reasonable assistance as the other party may reasonably
request in  connection with the foregoing.   (b) In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each  of the parties hereto will use all
commercially reasonable efforts to  (i) make or cause to be made the
applications or filings required to be  made by Buyer or the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries  under or with respect to the HSR Act or
with respect to the FCC  Consents, PUC Consents, and Municipal Franchising
Authority Consents,  and to pay any fees due of it in connection with such
applications or  filings, within ten Business Days after the date hereof, and
(ii)  comply as expeditiously as practicable with any request under or with 
respect to the HSR Act or with respect to the FCC Consents and PUC  Consents
for additional information, documents or other materials  received from the
Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice,  the FCC or any State
PUC in connection with such applications or  filings or the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this  Agreement. Each party hereto shall
promptly inform the others of any  communications from any Governmental
Entity regarding any of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything  to the contrary contained in this Section 5.6,
Buyer shall be under no  obligation whatsoever to take any action requested
by any Governmental  Entity in order to consummate the Merger or other
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
making  any divestiture of any asset or agreeing to any type of behavioral 
relief that a Governmental Entity may request.   (c) Between the date hereof
and the Closing Date, the Company  shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, maintain the validity of  the Communications Licenses and comply in all
material respects with  all requirements of the Communications Licenses and
the rules and  regulations of the FCC and State PUCs. The Company shall, and
shall  cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable commercial efforts to (a) 
refrain from taking any action which may jeopardize the validity of any  of
the Communications Licenses or result in the revocation, surrender  or any
adverse modification of, forfeiture of, or failure to renew  under regular
terms, any of the Communications Licenses, (b) prosecute  with due diligence
any pending applications with respect to the  Communications Licenses,
including any renewals thereof, and (c) with  respect to Communications

necessary or reasonably  appropriate for the continued operation of the
businesses of the  Company and its Subsidiaries, as and when such approvals,
consents,  permits, licenses, filings, or reports or other authorizations
are  necessary or appropriate.   (d) Subject to Section 5.6(b), in case at
any time after the  Effective Time any further action is necessary to carry
out the  purposes of this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement
shall  take or cause to be taken all such necessary action, including the 
execution and delivery of such further instruments and documents, as  may be
reasonably requested by any party hereto for such purposes or  otherwise to
complete or perfect the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.   (e)
The Company shall, to the extent Buyer may reasonably request  in connection
with any third-party financing Buyer and Merger Sub may  seek to obtain in
order to fund the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement and to
refinance the existing indebtedness of the Company,  use its commercially
reasonable efforts to, and shall cause the  Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, employees and  advisors to use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to:  (i) cooperate in the preparation of any
offering memorandum, private  placement memorandum, prospectuses or similar
documents, (ii) make  senior management of the Company reasonably available
for meetings and  due diligence sessions, (iii) cooperate with prospective
lenders,  placement agents, initial purchasers and their respective advisors
in  performing their due diligence, (iv) enter into customary agreements 
with underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents, (v) enter  into or
help procure pledge and security documents, landlord waivers,  other
definitive financing documents or other requested certificates or  documents,
including, without limitation, documents relating to the  release of liens in
connection with the Company\'s existing  indebtedness, and (vi) provide
reasonable assistance with respect to  obtaining a customary certificate of
the chief financial officer of the  Company with respect to solvency matters,
comfort letters of  accountants, legal opinions and real estate title
documentation as may  be reasonably requested by Buyer; provided that none of
the Company or  any Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment or
similar fee  or incur any other liability in connection with any such third-
party  financing prior to the Effective Time. Buyer shall, promptly upon 
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable  out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Company or the Subsidiaries in  connection with
such cooperation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  nothing in this Agreement
shall require the Company Board to take any  action to approve any third
party financing provided in connection with  the Merger. Between the date
hereof and the Closing Date, the Company  shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries, and their respective officers,  employees, agents, consultants
and other representatives to cooperate  with Buyer to develop and implement a
business integration plan  (including, without limitation, with respect to
network integration,  customer relationship management and personnel
deployment).   SECTION 5.7 Public Announcements. The parties hereto agree to
consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and, except as may be required by applicable     33   Law, will
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation.   SECTION 5.8 Indemnification of Directors and
Officers.   (a) For not less than six years from and after the Effective 
Time, Buyer agrees to, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to,  indemnify
and hold harmless all past and present directors and officers  of the Company
("Covered Persons") to the same extent such persons are  indemnified as of
the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to  the Company\'s second
amended and restated certificate of incorporation  and second amended and
restated by-laws and indemnification agreements,  if any, in existence on the
date of this Agreement with any Covered  Persons for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective  Time; provided, however, that Buyer
agrees to, and to cause the  Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold
harmless such persons to  the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law for
acts or omissions  occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each
Covered  Person shall be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in
the  defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with 
respect to any matters subject to indemnification hereunder, provided  that
any person to whom expenses are advanced undertakes, to the extent  required
by the DGCL, to repay such advanced expenses if it is  ultimately determined
that such person is not entitled to  indemnification. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if  any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising  before, at or after the Effective Time) is
made against any Covered  Person with respect to matters subject to
indemnification hereunder on  or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the provisions  of this Section 5.8 shall continue in effect
until the final  disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.   (b) The Surviving Corporation shall provide to the
Company\'s  present and past directors and officers a fully prepaid insurance
and  indemnification policy ("DandO; Insurance") in amount and scope as 
required by the Trust Agreement that provides coverage for events  occurring
on or before the Effective Time. If such prepaid policies  have been obtained
prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall, and shall  cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain such policies in full  force and effect, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder. The  Company represents that
the current annual premiums paid by the Company  in respect of DandO; Insurance
is set forth in Section 5.8(b) of the  Company Disclosure Schedule.   (c)
The obligations under this Section 5.8 shall not be  terminated or modified
in such a manner as to affect adversely any  indemnitee to whom this Section
5.8 applies without the consent of such  affected indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the indemnitees to  whom this Section 5.8 apply and
their respective heirs, successors and  assigns shall be express third-party
beneficiaries of this Section  5.8). In the event Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation (i) consolidates  with or merges into any other person and shall
not be the continuing or  surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii)  transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any  person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so  that such continuing or     34   
surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the  case
may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section  5.8.  
SECTION 5.9 Expenses. Except for expenses arising out of the filing of a
premerger notification and report form under the HSR Act with respect to
the Merger (which such expenses shall be shared equally by Buyer and the
Company) and as otherwise provided in Section 7.3, each party hereto shall
bear its own fees, costs and expenses incurred in the pursuit of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the fees and expenses
of its respective counsel, financial advisors and accountants.   SECTION
5.10 Section 16 Compliance. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, any dispositions of shares of Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to shares of
Common Stock) that are treated as dispositions under such rule and result
from the Merger or other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company.   SECTION 5.11 Supplemental
Information. The Company shall give prompt notice to Buyer of (i) any written
notice or other communication from any third party alleging that the consent
of such third party is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any Company Material Adverse Effect or
the occurrence of any event or events which would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect,
(iii) the Company becoming aware of any facts, matters or circumstances that
would cause any condition to the obligations of Buyer or Merger Sub to effect
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to
be satisfied or (iv) the occurrence or existence of any event which would, or
could with the passage of time or otherwise, make any representation or
warranty contained herein (without giving effect to any exception or
qualification contained therein relating to materiality or a Company Material
Adverse Effect) untrue in any material respect; provided, however, that the
delivery of notice pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to Buyer.   SECTION 5.12 Tax
Matters.   (a) Buyer shall be liable for all Transfer Taxes arising from
the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. "Transfer Taxes" means
all  sales, use, real property transfer, real property gains, transfer, 
stamp, registration, documentary, recording or similar Taxes, together  with
any interest thereon, penalties, fines, costs, fees or additions  to tax. The
parties will cooperate with each other in timely making all  filings, returns
and forms as may be required in connection with the  payment of any Transfer
Taxes.   (b) The Company shall deliver to Buyer a certificate pursuant to 
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) stating that the Company is  not
nor has it been a U.S. real property holding corporation (as  defined in
Section 897(c)(2) of the Code) during the applicable period  specified in
Section 897(c)(1) of the Code.     35    (c) During the period from the
date of this Agreement to the  Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall:   (i) prepare, in the ordinary course (except as otherwise  required
by Law), and timely file all material Tax Returns  required to be filed by it
(or them) on or before the Closing  Date ("Post-Signing Returns");   (ii)
fully and timely pay all Taxes shown due and payable  in respect of such
Post-Signing Returns that are so filed and  provide Buyer with copies of such
Post-Signing Returns as soon as  practicable after filing; and   (iii)
promptly notify the Buyer of any material federal,  state, local or foreign
income or franchise and any other  material suit, claim, contest,
investigation, administrative or  judicial proceeding or audit initiated
against or with respect to  the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in respect
of any Tax matter  (other than those set forth on the Disclosure Schedules) 
(collectively, "Contests"), and not to settle or compromise any  such
Contests without the Buyer\'s consent, which consent shall  not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.   SECTION 5.13 State Takeover Statutes;
Rights Agreement. (a) Buyer, the Company and their respective Board of
Directors shall (i) take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that no
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes
applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) The
Board of Directors of the Company shall take all action to the extent
necessary in order to render the Rights Agreement inapplicable to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except
in connection with the foregoing sentence, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, (i) amend or
waive any provision of the Rights Agreement or (ii) take any action with
respect to, or make any determination under, the Rights Agreement, including
a redemption of the Rights, in each case in order to facilitate any Takeover
Proposal with respect to the Company.   SECTION 5.14 Employee Benefits
Matters. (a) Buyer hereby agrees that, for a period of six (6) months
immediately following the Effective Time, it shall, or it shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to, maintain employee benefit and
compensation plans, programs, contracts, arrangements and executive
perquisites for the benefit of active employees of the Company and the
Subsidiaries which, in the aggregate, will provide compensation and benefits
(other than equity compensation) that are at least equivalent to, and no less
favorable than, the compensation and benefits provided to such employees
under the employee benefit plans, programs, contracts and arrangements of the
Company and the Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may at
any time and in all events provide (or cause the     36   Surviving
Corporation to provide) health benefits to such employees under
an arrangement substantially similar to that provided to Buyer\'s or
its Subsidiaries\' similarly-situated employees. From and after the Effective
Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
honor in accordance with their terms, all contracts, agreements and
commitments of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are applicable to any current or former
employees, directors or consultants of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.   (b) Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
receive credit for all purposes (including, without limitation, for purposes
of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to
receive benefits) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
established or maintained by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the
Effective Time with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided,
however, that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any
benefit or the funding of any such benefit and that in no event shall such
service be required to be counted with respect to any equity incentive award
or for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan. In
addition, for purposes of participation by employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in any medical plan of Buyer or its Subsidiaries, Buyer or its
applicable Subsidiary shall waive any preexisting condition limitations to
the extent waived under the applicable medical plan of the Company and, with
respect to the plan year in which such employees first participate in such
medical plan, shall credit such employees for any out of pocket expenditures,
deductibles and employee contributions that were credited under any
predecessor medical plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   (c)
Buyer hereby agrees that for a period of two years immediately following the
Effective Time it shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to provide all employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries who
are employed thereby as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than employees who, as of the Effective Time, are party to
severance agreements) who are terminated without cause with a minimum level
of severance benefits equal to two (2) weeks for any period of employment for
less than one year plus one (1) week for each full or partial year after
their first year of employment. For purposes of determining the amount of
their minimum severance benefits under this Section 5.14(c), employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall receive credit for all service accrued or
deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time with the Company or any of its
subsidiaries.   SECTION 5.15 Financing. Buyer shall use its best efforts to
arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment
Letter, including using best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements
with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein and (ii)
satisfy or obtain the waiver of all conditions applicable to Buyer and Merger
Sub in such definitive agreements. In the event any portion of the Financing
becomes unavailable, Buyer shall use its best efforts to arrange to obtain
any such portion from alternative sources. Buyer shall give the Company
prompt notice of any material breach by any party of the Commitment Letter or
any termination of the Commitment Letter. Buyer shall keep the Company
informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Financing and shall not permit any material
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any    
37   material provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter without
first consulting the Company.   SECTION 5.16 Letter of Credit. (a) Buyer
hereby agrees that on or prior to May 19, 2006, it shall cause the bank
issuing the Initial Letter of Credit to provide an amendment thereto
increasing the amount available thereunder to $6,000,000 but otherwise
keeping the remaining terms of the Letter of Credit unchanged, or a
substitute letter of credit for $6,000,000 otherwise having the same terms as
the Initial Letter of Credit (the Initial Letter of Credit, as so amended, or
such substitute letter of credit, as applicable, being hereinafter referred
to as the "Letter of Credit"). If Buyer does not provide such amendment by
such date, the Company shall be entitled to draw the entire amount
available under the Initial Letter of Credit as liquidated damages for
failure to comply with this Section 5.16(a) and shall have no obligation to
return such amount to Buyer or Merger Sub; provided, however, that, if this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time for any reason other than
a breach by Buyer or Merger Sub, the Company shall no later than the second
Business Day after such termination repay such amount to Buyer by wire
transfer of immediately available funds.   (b) If Buyer does arrange for
the amendment to the Letter of Credit as provided in subsection (a) hereto,
the Letter of Credit shall serve as liquidity support to the Company in the
event that Buyer and Merger Sub do not consummate the Merger within twenty
(20) Business Days after receipt by Buyer of a written notification by an
authorized officer of the Company that all of the conditions specified in
Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have been satisfied. In such event, the Company will be
entitled to draw upon the Letter of Credit by delivery of the draw
certificate referred to therein signed by two authorized officers of
the Company. The delivery of such draw certificate shall be without prejudice
to the rights of Buyer and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, to assert any claim or position with respect to any issues or
disputes between the parties concerning the rights and obligations of the
parties under this Agreement, including without limitation whether the
