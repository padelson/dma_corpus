      Section 2.10 Allocation of Purchase Price. Prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a proposed allocation of the Purchase

provided, however, that Buyer may amend, in its reasonable judgment as to fair
market value, such allocation from the Closing Date and until the due date of
Seller's return for the taxable year in which the transaction is closed by
giving prior notice to Seller and obtaining Seller's prior consent to such
amendment, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Neither Buyer nor
Seller shall take any position, nor permit its Affiliates to take any position,
whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise, that is inconsistent with such
allocation unless required to do so by applicable Law.

      Section 2.11 Nonassignability of Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement but subject to Section 5.3(d) and Section
6.1(b), to the extent the sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or
delivery or attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to
Buyer, of any Contract or other asset that would be an Acquired Asset or any
claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom is
prohibited by any applicable Law or would require any authorizations, approvals,
consents or waivers of a Governmental Entity or other third party, and such
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not have been obtained
prior to the Closing, the Closing shall proceed without the sale, assignment,
sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of such Contract or other asset and
this Agreement shall not constitute a sale, assignment, sublease, transfer,
conveyance or delivery of such Contract or other asset or an attempt thereof. If
the Closing proceeds without the sale, transfer, conveyance, sublease,
assignment or delivery of any such Contract or other asset, then following the
Closing, the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts, and cooperate with
each other, to obtain promptly such authorizations, approvals, consents or
waivers; provided, however, that neither Seller nor Buyer shall be required to
pay any consideration for any such authorization, approval, consent or waiver
other than filing, recordation or similar fees which shall be paid by the Party
who is required by Law or course of dealing to do so. Pending such
authorization, approval, consent or waiver, Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to enter into any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful arrangements
with Buyer designed to provide to Buyer the benefits of use of such Contract or
other asset and the Parties shall cooperate to provide to Seller the benefits,
including any indemnities, that they would have obtained had the Contract or
other asset been conveyed to Buyer at the Closing. To the extent that Buyer is
provided the benefits pursuant to this Section 2.11 of any Contract or other
asset, Buyer shall perform the obligations of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
thereunder and any related liabilities that, but for the lack of an
authorization, approval, consent or waiver to assign such liabilities to Buyer,
would be Assumed Liabilities, and such obligations and liabilities shall, for
the purposes of Article VIII, be deemed to be Assumed Liabilities (except for
any obligation or liabilities that would be Excluded Liabilities). Once
authorization, approval, consent or waiver for the sale, assignment, sublease,
transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such Contract or other asset not sold,
assigned, subleased, transferred, conveyed or delivered at the Closing is
obtained, Seller shall or shall cause its Affiliates to assign, transfer, convey
and deliver such Contract or other asset to Buyer. Seller will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the insurance proceeds that would have been
available to Seller prior to the Closing with respect to Assumed Liabilities to
be available to Buyer on the same terms following the Closing, including filing
any claims arising out of events occurring prior to the Closing with the
insurance company and delivering


                                      -18-
<PAGE>
any proceeds which are Assumed Assets under Section 2.1(q) to Buyer. Seller
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Buyer after the Closing
with respect to the defense, resolution or settlement of the actions, suits,
proceedings, disputes, claims or investigations included in the Assumed
Liabilities (the "Assumed Litigation"), including providing Buyer reasonable
access to all records or documents pertaining to the Assumed Litigation, filing
or executing any documents (including an entry of appearance) with the
appropriate courts of competent jurisdiction, and such other actions as shall be
reasonably requested by Buyer until such matters have been disposed. Seller will
consent to the settlement or compromise of any Assumed Litigation or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect to such Assumed Litigation as necessary,
provided that such settlement, compromise or consent (a) includes an
unconditional release of Seller from all liability arising out of such Assumed
Litigation, (b) does not contain any settlement, compromise, consent, equitable
order, judgment or term which has a material adverse impact on Seller's
business, and (c) does not contain any admission or statement suggesting any
wrongdoing or liability on behalf of Seller. Buyer shall pay any out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by Seller as a result of Seller's compliance with
the provisions of this Section 2.11 that pertain to Assumed Litigation.

      Section 2.12 Prorations and Adjustments. The following items will be
prorated and adjusted, as applicable as of the Closing Date, with the intent
that Seller will bear such expenses to the extent they relate to the period
prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer will bear such expenses to the extent they
relate to the period from and after the Closing Date:

      (a) to the extent not metered directly to a third party tenant, all
charges and payments for utilities, water, vault charges, sewer charges and
rents and other charges by Governmental Entities that constitute Liens shall be
prorated as of the Closing Date;

      (b) all expenses incurred pursuant to leases included in the Assumed
Liabilities shall be prorated as of the Closing Date.

      (c) all real and personal property Taxes shall be prorated as of the
Closing Date;

      (d) all fees or charges under Licenses that are assigned to Buyer at
Closing shall be prorated as of the Closing Date;

      (e) all prepaid rents and other prepaid charges or credits with respect to
the period from and after the Closing Date paid by Seller or its Subsidiaries
under the Leases or Utility Contracts shall be transferred to Buyer, and Buyer
shall pay Seller therefore in addition to the Purchase Price, at Closing (the
"Prepaids");

      (f) the Texas franchise tax due from any Subsidiary for the 2005 report
year (which will be based on the period from January 1 through December 31,
2004) (the "Texas Franchise Tax") shall be allocated between Buyer and Seller as
follows: (i) if the Texas Franchise Tax is determined on the net taxable earned
surplus basis, Seller shall be liable for the amount of such Tax which would be
payable if the period upon which the tax is based ended on the Closing Date; and
(ii) if the Texas Franchise Tax is determined on the net taxable capital basis,
then such Tax shall be allocated between Seller and Buyer based on the number of
respective days of


                                      -19-
<PAGE>
ownership of the Subsidiaries by Seller and Buyer during the period from January
1 through December 31, 2004;

      (g) all Taxes (other than Taxes prorated pursuant to Section 2.12(c), (d)
or (f)) that are due from or that relate to any Subsidiary with respect to any
taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date shall be
allocated between Buyer and Seller as follows: (i) in the case of such Taxes
that are based upon or related to income or receipts, Seller shall be liable for
the amount of such Tax which would be payable if the period upon which the Tax
is based ended on the Closing Date (and for this purpose, the taxable period of
any partnership or other pass through entity in which a Subsidiary holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time); and (ii) in the
case of Taxes not described in clause (i) above that are imposed on a periodic
basis with respect to the business or assets of the Subsidiaries or otherwise
measured by the level of any item, such Taxes shall be allocated between Seller
and Buyer based on the number of respective days of ownership of the
Subsidiaries by Seller and Buyer during the relevant taxable period; and

      (h) all other income and expense of the Real Property, Surplus Leased Real
Property and Surplus Owned Real Property shall also be prorated as of the
Closing Date and appropriate payments or credits made at Closing.

      Appropriate cash payments shall be made, by Seller or Buyer, as
applicable, after the facts giving rise to the obligation for such payments are
known to Seller and Buyer, in the amounts necessary once a quarter for as long
as such obligations may arise as a net settlement beginning on the last day of
the calendar quarter immediately following the Closing after the Closing Date,
to give effect to the allocations provided for in this Section 2.12.

accordance with Seller's obligations pursuant to the Franchise Agreements.

         (b) Except as provided in Schedule 3.25(b) and as permitted under the
Franchise Agreements, the Advertising Funds have not been used to defray
Seller's expenses other than those expenses incurred administering the

         Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer hereby represents and warrants to Seller as of the date hereof
as follows:

         Section 4.1 Organization. Buyer is a corporation validly existing under
the Laws of the jurisdiction set forth in the preamble hereof, and has the
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted.

         Section 4.2 Authorization. Buyer has the corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and each Buyer Ancillary Document to which
it is a party, and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement has
been, and the Buyer Ancillary Documents to which Buyer is a party shall be as of
the Closing Date, duly authorized, executed and delivered by Buyer and do or
shall, as the case may be, when duly executed by all parties and delivered by
Buyer, constitute the valid and binding agreements of Buyer, enforceable against
Buyer in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar Laws affecting the enforceability of
creditors' rights generally, general equitable principles and the discretion of
courts in granting equitable remedies.

         Section 4.3 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. Except for
applicable requirements of the HSR Act, neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
(a) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the organizational
documents of Buyer; (b) require any filing with, or the obtaining of any permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity; (c) violate,
conflict with or result in a default (or any event which, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, mortgage, other evidence of indebtedness, guarantee,
license, agreement, lease or other contract, instrument or obligation to which
Buyer is a party or by which Buyer or any of its assets may be bound; or (d)
violate any Law, order, injunction or decree applicable to Buyer, excluding from
the foregoing clauses (b), (c) and (d) such requirements, violations, conflicts,
defaults or rights (i) which would not materially and adversely affect the
ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or (ii) which become applicable as a result of any acts or omissions by, or the
status of or any facts pertaining to, Seller.

         Section 4.4 Litigation. There is no claim, action, suit, proceeding or
governmental investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened
against Buyer, by or before any Governmental Entity or by any third party which
challenges the validity of this Agreement or which would be reasonably likely to
adversely affect or restrict Buyer's ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

         Section 4.5 Certain Fees. Buyer has not employed any broker, finder,
investment banker, or other intermediary or incurred any liability for any
investment banking fees, financial

connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

         Section 4.6 Financial Capability. Buyer is a newly formed corporation
which has conducted no business other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Schedule 4.6 hereto contains true, complete and
correct copies of executed commitment letters and an executed definitive
Assignment Agreement to provide to Buyer financing for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in an aggregate amount of $413,000,000 (the
"Financing Documents"). The Financing Documents are in full force and effect and
have not been amended or modified. Buyer has no reasonable expectation as of the

the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
payments of all fees and expenses incurred by Buyer in connection therewith.
Buyer will have available as of the Closing Date funds sufficient to pay for the
Purchase Price and the fees and expenses of Buyer related to the transactions
contemplated hereby and to assume the Assumed Liabilities. Buyer knows of no
circumstance or condition that could be reasonably expected to prevent the
availability at the Closing of such cash or availability. As of the date hereof,
Buyer has deposited with the Escrow Agent $20,000,000 (the "Down Payment
Amount") in an escrow account pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

         Section 4.7 Independent Review. Buyer has conducted its own independent
review and analysis of the Business and its condition, cash flow and prospects,
the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, and acknowledges that Buyer has
been provided access to the properties, premises and records of Seller for this
purpose. In entering this Agreement, Buyer has relied exclusively upon its own
investigation and analysis and the representations and warranties contained
herein or in the Seller Ancillary Documents, and Buyer:

         (a) acknowledges that: (i) it has had the opportunity to visit with
Seller and meet with the officers and other representatives to discuss the
Business and its condition, cash flow and prospects, the Acquired Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities, and (ii) all materials and information requested by Buyer
have been provided to Buyer to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction;

         (b) acknowledges that it has undertaken such due diligence (including a
review of the assets, liabilities, books, records and contracts of Seller) as
Buyer deems adequate; and

         (c) acknowledges that, except for representations and warranties made
in this Agreement or in the Seller Ancillary Documents, neither Seller nor any
of its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents or representatives
make any other representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the
accuracy or completeness of any of the information provided or made available to
Buyer or its agents or representatives prior to the execution of this Agreement.

                                      -36-
<PAGE>

         (j) not (i) modify, amend, cancel or terminate any existing agreement

         Section 5.2 Access to Information.

         (a) Subject to the restrictions of any applicable Law or contractual
undertaking, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, Seller shall

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

5.7; provided, however, that any such investigation shall be conducted during
normal business hours under the supervision of Seller's personnel and in such a
manner as to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and not interfere unreasonably with the business
operations of Seller.

         (b) All information furnished or provided by Seller or its Affiliates
to Buyer or its representatives (whether furnished before or after the date of
this Agreement) shall be held subject to the Confidentiality Agreement;
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, Buyer shall be allowed to initiate
title and lien searches with a title company (sharing certain confidential
information with the title company) of the Acquired Assets in connection with
its investigation of the Business.

         (c) Buyer agrees to make personnel of Buyer or its Affiliates
reasonably available to Seller to the extent such access is reasonably related
to any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities or otherwise necessary for Seller
to comply with the terms of this Agreement or any applicable Law; provided,
however that Seller shall reimburse Buyer promptly for its reasonable and
necessary documented out of pocket expenses incurred in complying with any such
request.

         (d) Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to provide Seller with such
documentation as Seller may reasonably request to permit Seller to conduct a

resources, condition and creditworthiness of Buyer.

         (e) As soon as practicable after the end of every 4 week period that
comprises one of Seller's normal accounting periods for the Business beginning
with such 4 week period in which this Agreement is signed, Seller will deliver
to Buyer an unaudited balance sheet of the Business as of the end of such 4 week
period, and related statements of income and cash flows for such 4 week period.

         (f) Buyer agrees that, because Seller will provide Buyer with copies of
all of Seller's assessments, reports, studies, tests, or monitoring pertaining
to Environmental Laws or Hazardous Substances relating to the Business or the
Acquired Assets as specified in Section 3.15, Buyer and its accountants, legal
counsel, environmental consultants, investment bankers, financial sources,
lenders and other representatives will not, prior to Closing, conduct any
additional or new environmental assessments, studies, investigations,
monitoring, or other inquiries pertaining to Environmental Laws or Hazardous
Substances and relating to the Real Property, the Surplus Owned Real Property or
the Surplus Leased Real Property, including, without limitation, any phase I
environmental site assessment, phase II environmental site assessment, or
invasive sampling of soil, groundwater, air, any other environmental media, or
building materials or equipment; provided, however, Buyer and the Real Estate
Assignee may review any existing site surveys previously performed for Seller
and visually inspect each property.

         (g) Seller shall use, and Seller shall cause the management of Seller
to use, reasonable best efforts to cooperate in all reasonable and customary
respects with Buyer and Buyer's agents to facilitate the consummation of the
financing contemplated by the Financing Documents (the expense of such
cooperation to be borne by Buyer), including without limitation,


                                      -38-
<PAGE>

the preparation of any customary offering memorandum, making available any
audited or unaudited financial statements as would customarily be provided in
connection with similar financings, and any customary marketing efforts
necessary in connection with the financing. Buyer agrees that it and the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall not have any claim against Seller arising from the
compliance by Seller with the provisions of this Agreement to the extent related
to assisting Buyer in obtaining the financing contemplated by the Financing
Documents, including based on financial statements or other information or
statements made or provided by or on behalf of Seller, except to the extent that
Buyer is otherwise entitled to indemnification under Section 8.1(a), after
taking into account the limitations set forth in Article VIII.

         Section 5.3 Consents.

         (a) Seller and Buyer shall each use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain all licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications and orders of Governmental Entities and other third parties
necessary, on Seller's or Buyer's part, respectively, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall reasonably cooperate with
the other to obtain the required consents. In addition to the foregoing, Buyer
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to provide such assurances as to
financial capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably
requested by any third party whose consent or approval is sought in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby.

         (b) Each of Seller and Buyer will promptly after execution of this
Agreement make all filings or submissions as are required under the HSR Act.
Each of Seller and Buyer will promptly furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary under the
HSR Act. Each of Seller and Buyer will promptly keep the other reasonably
informed of all material communications between each of them, any of their
Affiliates or any of its or their representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Seller and Buyer will promptly notify the other of the
receipt and content of any inquiries or requests for additional information made
by any Governmental Entity in connection therewith and will promptly (i) comply
with any such inquiry or request and (ii) provide the other with a description
of the information provided to any Governmental Entity with respect to any such
inquiry or request. In addition, each of Seller and Buyer will keep the other
apprised of the status of any such inquiry or request.

         (c) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts (both before and after
the Closing Date) (i) to promptly cause Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, as
the case may be, to be fully and unconditionally released and discharged from
any and all Assumed Liabilities and (ii) to promptly cause Buyer to be
substituted in the place of Seller or any of the Affiliates of Seller, as the
case may be, for all purposes under the Contracts.

         (d) If prior to Closing, with respect to all Owned Real Property or
Surplus Owned Real Property subject to a Right of First Refusal, Seller has not
obtained a release of Seller or the Subsidiary which is the lessor of such Owned
Real Property or Surplus Owned Real Property, the Subsidiaries and Buyer with
respect to such Right of First Refusal (in form reasonably acceptable to Buyer)
or otherwise provided reasonable evidence to Buyer that such Right of First


                                      -39-
<PAGE>

Refusal will not affect such property, then (i) each affected Owned Real
Property or Surplus Owned Real Property shall be a part of the Excluded Assets
and shall not be conveyed to Buyer at Closing and (ii) the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by an amount equal to the allocated value set forth for each such
Owned Real Property or Surplus Owned Real Property set forth on Schedule 5.3(d)
or, if such Owned Real Property or Surplus Owned Real Property is not identified
on such schedule, the quotient of the net lease income of Seller for such
property in fiscal year 2003 divided by .102 (each, an "Allocated Value");
provided, however, that with respect to the Right of First Refusal identified on
Schedule 5.3(d)(i), Seller shall obtain a release in the form described above
and the provisions of clauses (i) and (ii) above shall not apply to such Right
of First Refusal or the Owned Real Property subject thereto. If, prior to the
second anniversary of Closing, Seller has not conveyed any such Owned Real
Property or Surplus Owned Real Property as a result of the applicable Right of
First Refusal and Seller would then be able to provide the release or evidence
described above, then within thirty (30) days of such occurrence, Seller shall
convey the affected Owned Real Property or Surplus Owned Real Property to Buyer
for a purchase price equal to the Allocated Value for such Owned Real Property
or Surplus Owned Real Property. In such event, Buyer and Seller shall make such
closing deliveries and pay such closing costs with respect to such Owned Real
Property or Surplus Owned Real Property as are set forth in this Agreement with
respect to the Real Property conveyed to Buyer at Closing and treat such Owned
Real Property or Surplus Owned Real Property as an Acquired Asset for all
purposes under this Agreement.

         Section 5.4 Reasonable Best Efforts. Each of Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate, and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on or before December 21, 2004. Seller will use its reasonable
best efforts to ensure that the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof are
satisfied on or before December 21, 2004, insofar as such matters are within the
control of Seller, and Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof are satisfied on or before
December 21, 2004, insofar as such matters are within the control of Buyer. The
Parties further covenant and agree, with respect to a threatened or pending
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or statute,
rule, regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the ability of
the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, to use their
reasonable best efforts to prevent or lift the entry, enactment or promulgation
thereof, as the case may be.

         Section 5.5 Shared Contracts. With respect to each Shared Contract,
only the portion of such Shared Contract that relates to the Business or the
Acquired Assets shall be transferred to and assumed by Buyer at the Closing, and
the rights and obligations under such Shared Contract shall be equitably
apportioned between Buyer and Seller. As promptly as is reasonably practicable
following the Closing, each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
determine whether to (and after such determination, use its reasonable best
efforts to so implement such determination) (a) attempt to enter into new
agreements with the relevant third party relative to the allocation of rights
and responsibilities under that Shared Contract, (b) enter into an agreement
between the Parties relative to the assignment of a Party's rights and the
delegation of a Party's duties under the Shared Contract, or (c) arrive at some
other form of agreement which maximizes the total benefit to the Parties of the
Contract, while equitably apportioning the rights


                                      -40-
<PAGE>

and obligations of the Parties under the Contract; provided, however, that the
Assumed Liabilities shall be allocated to Buyer and the Excluded Liabilities
shall be allocated to Seller.

         Section 5.6 Public Announcements. Except as otherwise agreed to by the
Parties, the Parties shall not issue any report, statement or press release or
otherwise make any public statements with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, except as in the reasonable judgment of a
Party may be required by Law or by the rules of a national securities exchange,
and in any event a Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with
the other Party at a reasonable time in advance of such required disclosure.

         Section 5.7 Employees; Employee Benefits.

         (a) Effective on the Closing Date, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall
offer (and Seller shall give Buyer an opportunity to offer) employment to all
Employees (except that Buyer shall not be obligated to offer employment to any
of the Employees identified on Schedule 3.13(g) so long as Buyer gives written
notice thereof to Seller within five (5) Business Days after the date hereof),
on terms and conditions which, in the aggregate and for a period of at least one
(1) year, provide economic value that is substantially comparable to that
provided to the Transferred Employees (as defined below) on the Closing Date,
including, without limitation, employee benefit plans and benefit arrangements
which, in the aggregate, provide the Transferred Employees economic value that
is substantially comparable to that provided by Seller and its Affiliates to the
Employees on the Closing Date under the Seller Benefit Plans disclosed on
Schedule 3.13(b), without taking into account the value of any option or
equity-based grants or arrangements, severance arrangements or vacation or other
paid time off arrangements. Buyer's offers of employment to such Employees shall
be made as soon as practicable following the date hereof; provided, however,
that all such offers of employment shall be made no later than the day prior to
the Closing Date and all such offers shall remain open at least until the
Closing Date. Those Employees who accept such offers of employment with Buyer or
an Affiliate of Buyer effective as of the Closing Date (or, if applicable, upon
expiration of any authorized leave within one (1) year of the Closing Date)
shall be referred to herein as "Transferred Employees." Seller will deliver to
Buyer on the Closing Date an updated version of Schedule 3.13(a) that lists all
Employees as of the most recent practicable date, which updated schedule shall
also indicate as of such date which such Employees are on a leave of absence and
the type of leave.

         (b) Subject to Section 5.7(c) below, Buyer agrees that, effective as of
the day after the Closing Date (or such later date as may be provided in the
Transition Services Agreement), (i) Buyer shall provide the Transferred
Employees with coverage under a "group health plan" (as defined in Section
4980B(g)(2) of the Code) sufficient to prevent any Transferred Employee or any
"qualified beneficiary" (as defined in Section 4980B(g)(l) of the Code) thereof,
other than any individual who incurs a loss of coverage on or before the Closing
Date, under any medical plan applicable to the Transferred Employees from
incurring a loss of coverage after the Closing Date; (ii) Buyer will cause the
benefit plans applicable to the Transferred Employees to recognize all previous
service with Seller or its Affiliates for the purpose of determining eligibility
for an entitlement to benefits earned after the Closing Date, including vesting
(provided that service with Seller or its Affiliates will not be counted for
purposes of benefit accrual or early retirement eligibility under any pension
plan of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer);


                                      -41-
<PAGE>

(iii) Buyer will cause its group health plan to recognize all deductibles and
coinsurance payments accrued by the Transferred Employees from January 1, 2004
through the Closing Date (or, if the Closing Date is after January 1, 2005, for
2005) and to waive any preexisting condition limitations for the Transferred
Employees; (iv) for the remainder of the calendar year in which the Closing
occurs the vacation and holiday plan offered to Transferred Employees shall be
equal to and in place of what Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable, provide
the Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date; (v) Buyer shall maintain for
at least one (1) year starting on the Closing Date a severance arrangement (not
including the Seller Severance Agreements) for the Transferred Employees that is
substantially similar to the severance pay arrangement for other Employees as

basis of the Third Party Claim, and, if determinable, a good faith, non-binding
estimate of the amount relating thereto); provided, however, that the failure to
so notify the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from
liability under this Agreement with respect to such Third Party Claim only if,
and only to the extent that, such failure to notify the Indemnifying Party
results in (i) the forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses
otherwise available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party
Claim or (ii) material prejudice to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such
Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written
notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days thereafter, to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim using counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of the fees and
disbursements of such counsel so long as the Indemnifying Party agrees in such
notice that any Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer arising out of or
resulting from the Third Party Claim are Losses for which the Indemnified Party
is entitled to receive payment from the other Party under Section


                                      -51-
<PAGE>
8.1 or Section 8.2 subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII. If
the Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume the defense of the Third
Party Claim on the terms provided above within such thirty (30) day period,
however, the Indemnified Party may employ counsel to represent or defend it in
any such Third Party Claim. If (x) the Indemnifying Party fails to respond to a
Third Party Notice of Claim or (y) it is determined (by mutual agreement,
arbitration, or litigation) that an audit, investigation, action or proceeding
is a matter with respect to which the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive
payment from the Indemnifying Party for the Loss in question, the Indemnifying
Party will pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel as incurred
to the Indemnified Party in immediately available funds; provided, however, that
the Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay the fees and disbursements of
more than one (1) counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction in any
single Third Party Claim. In any Third Party Claim with respect to which
indemnification is being sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of such action, shall
have the right to participate in such matter and to retain its own counsel at
such Party's own expense. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as
the case may be, shall at all times use reasonable best efforts to keep the
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, reasonably
apprised of the status of any matter the defense of which they are maintaining
and to cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to the defense of
any such matter.

      (b) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, except
that if the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense of any claim
pursuant to Section 8.3(a), then such Indemnified Party may settle or compromise
any such claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such
claim with the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. An Indemnifying Party may not, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any
claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which
indemnification is being sought hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or
consent (x) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such claim, (y) does not contain any settlement,
compromise, consent, equitable order, judgment or term which has a material
adverse impact on the Business and (z) does not contain any admission or
statement suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the Indemnified
Party. When the amount of any Loss relating to a Third Party Claim becomes
finally determined (by mutual agreement, arbitration, litigation or otherwise),
the Indemnifying Party will promptly pay to the Indemnified Party the amount of
such Loss subject to the limitations of this Article VIII.

      (c) If an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant to this
Agreement not involving a Third Party Claim covered by Section 8.3(a) hereof,
such Indemnified Party shall send written notice of such claim to the
appropriate Indemnifying Party (a "General Notice of Claim"). Such notice shall
reasonably specify the basis for such claim. Either (x), if the Indemnifying
Party fails to respond to the General Notice of Claim within thirty (30) days of
delivery or (y) if it is determined that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
receive payment for the Loss in question (by mutual agreement, arbitration or
litigation), within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the
merits and amount of such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall pay


                                      -52-
<PAGE>
to the Indemnified Party immediately available funds in an amount equal to such
claim as determined hereunder, if any.

      Section 8.4 Survival of Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties in Articles III and IV of this Agreement shall
survive the Closing to the extent set forth in this Section 8.4. The Claims
Period under this Agreement with respect to all Losses described in Sections
8.1(a) and 8.2(a) other than (a) Losses resulting from a breach of the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3
or the Seller's Certificate or the Buyer's Certificate, respectively, as it
relates to such sections (the "Excepted Representations"), (b) Losses resulting
from a breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.15 or
the Seller's Certificate as it relates to such section (the "Environmental
Representations"), (c) Losses resulting from a breach of the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.4 or the Seller's Certificate as it relates to
such section (except to the extent Section 3.4 relates to the representations
and warranties in Section 3.9(a)) (the "Title Representations"), (d) Losses
resulting from a breach of the representation and warranty of Seller contained
in the second sentence of Section 3.8(a) or the Seller's Certificate as it
relates to such section (the "Real Property Representations") and (e) Losses
resulting from a breach of the representation and warranty of Section 3.9(c) or
the Seller's Certificate as it relates to such section solely to the extent such
representation and warranty pertains to registered trademarks for "Church's
Chicken" and "Texas Chicken" (the "Major Trademark Title Representation") shall
commence on the Closing Date and shall terminate on the date that is eighteen
(18) months after such date. The Claims Period under this Agreement with respect
to all Losses described in (w) Section 8.1(a) with respect to breaches of the
Environmental Representations and the Excepted Representations shall commence on
the Closing Date and shall terminate on the date that is three (3) years after
such date, (x) Section 8.1(a) with respect to the Major Trademark Title
Representation shall commence on the Closing Date and shall terminate on the
date that is three (3) years after such date, (y) Section 8.1(a) with respect to
the Real Property Representations shall commence on the Closing Date and shall
terminate on the date that is five (5) years after such date, and (z) Section
8.1(a) with respect to breaches of the representations and warranties contained
in the Title Representations shall commence on the Closing Date and shall
terminate on the date that is five (5) years after such date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if prior to the close of business on the last day of the Claims
Period, an Indemnifying Party shall have been properly notified of a claim for
indemnity hereunder and such claim shall not have been finally resolved or
disposed of at such date, such claim shall continue to survive and shall remain
a basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or disposed
of in accordance with the terms hereof.

      Section 8.5 Limitations on Indemnification.

      (a) No claim or claims may be made against an Indemnifying Party for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1(a) (other than in respect of the Real
Property Representations, the Environmental Representations and the Major
Trademark Title Representation) or Section 8.2(a) unless the Losses of the
Indemnified Party with respect to such section (other than in respect of the
Environmental Representations, which shall be governed by the following
sentence) shall exceed an amount equal to Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000)
(the "Deductible"), in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to
the Indemnified Party only for the amount of the Loss in excess of the
Deductible, subject to Section 8.5(c); provided,


                                      -53-
<PAGE>
however, that for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of claims, no
individual claim for indemnification under Section 8.1(a) (other than in respect
of the Real Property Representations the Major Trademark Title Representation)
or Section 8.2(a) shall be included unless and until the Losses resulting from
such individual claim exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000).

      (b) No claim or claims may be made against Seller for indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.1(a) as a result of breaches of the Environmental
Representations, unless the Losses of the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect
to such breaches shall exceed an amount equal to Three Million Dollars
($3,000,000) (the "Environmental Deductible"), in which case Seller shall be
obligated to the Buyer Indemnified Parties only for eighty percent (80%) of the
amount of the Loss in excess of the Environmental Deductible, subject to Section
8.5(c); provided, however, that for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount
of claims, no individual claim for indemnification under Section 8.1(a) in
respect of the Environmental Representations shall be included unless and until
the Losses from such individual claim, exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000).
If a claim or claims may be made under Section 8.1(a) in respect of the
Environmental Representations, then such claim or claims may not be made in
respect of a breach of any of the other representations or warranties,
regardless of whether the facts and circumstances with respect to such claim or
claims would have otherwise entitled a Party to assert such claim or claims. No
individual claim may be made against Seller for indemnification pursuant to
Section 8.1(a) as a result of the Major Trademark Title Representation unless
and until the Losses resulting from such individual claim exceed Twenty Five
Thousand Dollars ($25,000).

      (c) No Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any Loss, to the extent such
Losses (in aggregate) relating to Section 8.1(a) (including those relating to
breaches of the Excepted Representations, the Environmental Representations, the
Title Representations, the Real Property Representations and the Major Trademark
Title Representation) or Section 8.2(a) exceed Forty Million Dollars
($40,000,000), and no Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any Loss to the
extent such Losses (in aggregate) relating to Section 8.1(a) in respect of
breaches of the Environmental Representations or in any certificate relating
thereto exceed Five Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,600,000).

      (d) For purposes of computing the aggregate amount of claims against
Seller, the amount of each claim by an Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be
an amount equal to, and any payments by an Indemnifying Party shall be limited
to, the amount of Losses that remain after deducting therefrom (A) any third
party insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contributions or other similar
payment payable by any third party with respect thereto, and (B) any net tax
benefit recognized by an Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof with respect
to the Losses or items giving rise to such claim for indemnification.

      (e) The amount of indemnity payable pursuant to Section 8.1 or in any
certificate relating thereto with respect to any Loss shall be reduced to the
extent such Loss is reflected on the Final Working Capital Schedule or, except
to the extent otherwise specifically agreed to herein, in the Financial
Statements.

      (f) In any claim for indemnification under this Agreement, Seller shall
not be required to indemnify any Person for special, exemplary, punitive or
consequential damages,


                                      -54-
<PAGE>
including loss of profit or revenue, any multiple of reduced cash flow,
interference with operations, or loss of tenants, lenders, investors or buyers.

      (g) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from third Persons any
amount in respect of a matter with respect to which the Indemnifying Party has
fully indemnified it pursuant to this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall
promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after
deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring
such recovery), but not in excess of the sum of any amount previously so paid by
the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Party in respect
of such matter.

      (h) Any indemnity payment under this Agreement by Seller shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal income tax purposes.

      Section 8.6 Exclusive Remedies. Except for any claims against Buyer or
Seller for fraud in connection with this Agreement, the provisions of Section
7.2(c), this Article VIII and Section 9.10 hereof set forth the exclusive rights
and remedies of Buyer and Seller to seek or obtain damages or any other remedy
or relief whatsoever from any party with respect to matters arising under or in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that this Section 8.6 shall not apply to the Transition
Services Agreement or the Sublease Agreement.

      Section 8.7 Survival of Covenants and Agreements. The covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, any Buyer Ancillary Document or any
