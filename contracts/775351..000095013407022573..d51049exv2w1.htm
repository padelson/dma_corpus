VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY SELLERS, ANY OF THE COMPANIES, ANY MEMBER OF THE
SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES OR ANY OTHER PERSON, EXCLUDING THE GROSS

 Section 6.4 _Preference Rights_. 

   

 (a) Buyer acknowledges that its right to purchase (i) each of the OCF System and the Quindaro System (a " _Preference Property_ ") are subject to a Preference Right, (ii) the OCF System is subject to the consent to assignment contained in the Contract listed in item 6 on _Schedule 3.3_ (the " _OCF System Consent_ "), (iii) the Quindaro System is subject to the consent to assignment contained in the Contract listed in item 5 on  _Schedule 3.3_ (the " _Quindaro System Consent_ "), and (iv) the Augusta System is subject to the consent to assignment contained in the Contract listed in item 2 on  _Schedule 3.3_ (the " _Augusta System Consent_ "). 

   

 (b) The portion of the Base Purchase Price allocated to the Augusta System, the OCF System and the Quindaro System is set forth in _Schedule 6.4(b)_. 

   

 (c) Until each of the Preference Rights has been exercised, waived or expired and each of the Midcoast System Consents has been obtained or denied, Sellers shall use Reasonable Efforts to obtain the waiver of such Preference Rights and to obtain such Midcoast System Consents; _provided, however_ , Sellers shall not be obligated to pay any consideration to (or incur any cost or expense for the benefit of) (i) the holder of any Preference Right in order to obtain the waiver thereof or compliance therewith, or (ii) the holder of any Midcoast System Consent in order to obtain the same. 

   

 (d) If the holder of a Preference Right elects prior to Closing to purchase the Preference Property subject to such Preference Right in accordance with the terms of such Preference Right, and Sellers and Buyer receive written notice of such election prior to the Closing, then such Preference Property will be eliminated from the Midcoast Assets and the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the portion of the Base Purchase Price allocated to such Preference Property. 

   

 (e) If the holder of a Preference Right elects to purchase the Preference Property subject to such Preference Right in accordance with the terms of such Preference Right following the Closing, but prior to expiration of such Preference Right, then such Preference Property will be eliminated from the Midcoast Assets and Sellers 

   ##### 

  

    

shall promptly pay to Buyer an amount equal to the portion of the Base
Purchase Price which is allocated to such Preference Property pursuant to
Section 6.4(b). 

   

 (f) If either (i) the holder of a Preference Right who has been offered a Preference Property or who has been requested to waive its Preference Right pursuant to Section 6.4(a) does not elect to purchase such Preference Property or waive such Preference Right with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Closing Date and the time in which the Preference Right may be exercised has not expired, or (ii) one or more Midcoast Systems Consents is not obtained prior to the Closing Date, or (iii) Midcoast Holdings has not obtained Sellers KCC Authorization or Buyer or a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer has not obtained Buyers KCC Certificate, then, in each case, the Midcoast Assets will be held back and not transferred and conveyed to Buyer at Closing but the Base Purchase Price to be paid at Closing shall not be reduced by the portion of the Base Purchase Price which is allocated to the Midcoast Systems pursuant to Section 6.4(b). 

   

 (g) If the Midcoast Assets are held back and not transferred and conveyed to Buyer at Closing pursuant to Section 6.4(f), then promptly following the date on which all of the Preference Rights have been exercised, waived or expired and all of the Midcoast Systems Consents have been obtained or denied (provided, however, that in no event shall such date extend beyond 180 days following the Closing Date), Sellers agree to provide written notice to Buyer listing each Midcoast System as to which: (i) any applicable Preference Right has been waived or the time period to exercise same has expired; and (ii) the applicable Midcoast Systems Consent has been obtained (such Midcoast System together with the Midcoast Assets associated therewith are referred to as a " _Lateral System_ "). 

   

 (h) After all the Preference Rights have been either exercised, waived or expired and all of the Midcoast System Consents have either been obtained or denied, Midcoast Holdings agrees to use Reasonable Efforts to promptly obtain Sellers KCC Authorization, and Buyer agrees to use Reasonable Efforts to promptly obtain Buyers KCC Certificate, covering the Lateral Systems. 

   

 (i) The Lateral Systems will be conveyed to Buyer or a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer at a delayed Closing (which shall become the new Closing Date with respect to the Lateral Systems), within ten (10) days after the last to occur of the following, (i) the date Midcoast Holdings obtains Sellers KCC Authorization for the Lateral Systems covered by the Sellers KCC Authorization, and (ii) the date Buyer obtains Buyers KCC Certificate for the Lateral Systems covered by the Buyers KCC Certificate. Midcoast Holdings shall retain (A) any Midcoast Assets that are not included in the Lateral Systems or are included in any Lateral System not covered by Sellers KCC Authorization or Buyers KCC Certificate, (B) any of the Midcoast Assets that are included in the Lateral Systems but later removed therefrom by mutual agreement of Midcoast Holdings and Buyer in order to obtain Sellers KCC Authorization or Buyers KCC Certificate and (C) in the event Midcoast Holdings does not obtain Sellers KCC Authorization or Buyer does not obtain Buyers KCC Certificate within 180 days following the date on which Sellers and Buyer have filed the Sellers KCC Authorization 

   ##### 

  

    

and Buyers KCC Certificate, respectively, with the KCC (the " _Lateral
Systems Date_ "), all of the Lateral Systems (the " _Retained Assets_ ").
Sellers shall promptly pay to Buyer an amount equal to the portion of the
Base Purchase Price which is allocated to such Retained Assets pursuant to
Section 6.4(b) on the first to occur of (x) the date of the delayed Closing

 Section 6.6 _Employee and Benefit Matters_. 

   

 (a) On or before the Closing, Sellers shall take all actions necessary, if any, to cause the Companies to cease to be adopting or participating employers under all Seller Plans. Except as expressly provided in the remaining paragraphs of this Section 6.6, Buyer shall not, and from and after the Closing Date the Companies shall not, have any responsibility or liability with respect to Seller Plans, or to Company Plans established 

   ##### 

  

    

prior to the Closing Date, and Sellers will be responsible for such
responsibilities and liabilities. 

   

 (b) _Schedule 6.6(b)_ sets forth a list of certain employees of Sellers or their Affiliates who provide services relating to the Business and which Sellers and such Affiliates shall make available to Buyer to discuss potential employment after the Closing with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer (such employees being collectively the " _Affiliate Employees_ "). Within twenty five (25) days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliate to offer employment (which shall be contingent on the occurrence of the Closing) to each Affiliate Employee at a base salary or hourly rate that is at least equal to such Affiliate Employees then current base salary or hourly rate and with a principal place of employment no greater than forty-nine (49) miles from the location where the Affiliate Employee is currently employed (a " _Qualifying Offer_ "); provided, however, that Buyer (or its Affiliate) will not be required to offer employment to any Affiliate Employee that does not satisfactorily complete Buyers normal drug testing procedure. Each offer of employment to an Affiliate Employee shall be consistent with the provisions of this Section 6.6 and shall remain open for a period of at least 7 days. On or before the date that is five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall notify Sellers as to each Affiliate Employee who has accepted employment with Buyer or its Affiliate, and each Affiliate Employee who has rejected an offer of such employment. If Buyer or its Representative acts unlawfully with respect to the employee selection and employee offer process with respect to any Affiliated Employee or if Buyer violates the requirements of this Section 6.6(b), Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and their respective Affiliates with respect to all Losses relating to or arising out of Buyers (or its Representatives) unlawful actions or Buyers violation of the requirements of this Section 6.6(b) (including any claim of discrimination or other illegality by Buyer in such selection and offer process and also including any severance benefits that may become due and owing under any Seller Severance Plan as a result of Buyers unlawful acts or violation of this Section 6.6(b)). The employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer of each Affiliate Employee who accepts such employment shall be effective as of the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) For a period of at least one year beginning on the Closing Date and subject to the remaining paragraphs of this Section 6.6 and an individuals continued employment with a Company, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates, Buyer shall cause each Affiliate Employee who accepts Buyers offer of employment (" _Continuing Employee_ ") to be provided with (i) compensation (including annual incentive compensation) on a basis substantially similar to that provided by Sellers and its Affiliates to such employee immediately prior to the Closing so that, in the aggregate, such compensation shall be equal to the Continuing Employees base salary immediately prior to Closing and (ii) benefits on a basis substantially similar to those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates. Sellers agree that in consideration of Buyers commitments hereunder that neither Sellers nor their Affiliates will (x) prior to the Closing Date, solicit or offer to any Affiliate Employee any employment opportunity that is an alternative to the offer of employment to be made by Buyer hereunder, or (y) during the one year period beginning on the Closing Date, solicit for employment or employ any Continuing Employee; _provided, however_ , that a general 

   ##### 

  

    

advertisement or general solicitation for potential employees shall not be
considered a breach of this Section 6.6(c), and a decision to hire any
Affiliate Employee or Continuing Employee who applies in response to such
solicitation shall not be considered a breach of this Section 6.6(c). 

   

 (d) Buyer shall cause each Continuing Employee and his eligible dependents (including all such Continuing Employees dependents covered immediately prior to the Closing Date by a Seller Plan that is a group health plan) to be covered under group health, prescription drug, dental and similar type welfare benefit plans as then maintained by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer that (i) provide benefits to the Continuing Employee and such eligible dependents effective immediately upon the Closing Date and (ii) credit such Continuing Employee, for the year during which such coverage under such plans begin, with any deductibles and co-payments already incurred during such year under Seller Plans that provide similar benefits. 

   

 (e) Buyer shall cause the employee benefit plans and programs maintained after the Closing by Buyer, the Companies and the Affiliates of Buyer to recognize each Continuing Employees years of service prior to the Closing Date with Sellers, the Business, the Companies and their Affiliates (including service with any other employer that was recognized by Sellers, the Companies or their respective Affiliates) for purposes of terms of employment and eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual and benefit determination under such plans and programs, including paid vacation, paid sick time, severance benefits and employer contribution rates under retirement plans. Any vacation time that has been accrued, but unused, by a Continuing Employee as of the Closing shall be extinguished and paid out to the Continuing Employee by Sellers or their Affiliates. To the extent required by Law, Buyer shall cause each group health plan sponsored by Buyer or one of its Affiliates that a Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate in on or after the Closing Date to waive any preexisting condition exclusions applicable to such Continuing Employee and his eligible dependents. 

   

 (f) Claims of Continuing Employees and their eligible beneficiaries and dependents for medical, dental, prescription, drug, life insurance, and/or other welfare benefits (" _Welfare Benefits_ ") (other than disability benefits) that are incurred before the Closing Date shall be the sole responsibility of the Seller Plans. Claims of Continuing Employees and their eligible beneficiaries and dependents for Welfare Benefits (other than disability benefits) that are incurred on or after the Closing Date shall be the sole responsibility of Buyer and the Companies. For purposes of the preceding provisions of this paragraph, a medical/dental claim shall be considered incurred on the date when the medical/dental services are rendered or medical/dental supplies are provided, and not when the condition arose or when the course of treatment began. Claims of individuals receiving long-term disability benefits under a Seller Plan as of the Closing Date shall be the sole responsibility of the Seller Plan. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, claims of Continuing Employees and their eligible beneficiaries and dependents for short-term or long-term disability benefits from and after the Closing Date shall be based upon the disability benefits provided by Buyer to similarly situated employees and shall be the sole responsibility of Buyer and the Companies. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (g) For a period of one year beginning with the Closing Date, Buyer shall be solely responsible for and shall pay severance benefits to each Continuing Employee hired by Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies) whose employment with Buyer or its Affiliates is involuntarily terminated (other than termination for cause) within the one year period beginning with the Closing Date, and such severance benefits shall be identical in amount to the severance benefits under the Enbridge Pipeline (KPC) Severance Benefits Plan And Summary Plan Description (as effective June 1, 2007 through December 3, 2008) (the " _Seller Severance Plan_ "). The obligations of Buyer set forth in the preceding sentence shall continue for the stated one year period notwithstanding any provision in the Seller Severance Plan that causes such plan to cease providing severance benefits at any time after the Closing. 

   

 (h) Sellers shall be responsible for all liabilities (including liabilities for associated administrative functions) for workers compensation claims made for compensable injuries occurring before the Closing Date. Buyer shall be responsible for all liabilities (including liabilities for associated administrative functions) for all workers compensation claims made on or after the Closing Date by Continuing Employees. For purposes of this Section 6.6(h), a workers compensation claim shall be "made" at the time of the occurrence of the event giving rise to eligibility for workers compensation benefits or at the time the occupational disease becomes manifest, as applicable, under the respective workers compensation act governing the alleged injury. Sellers will notify applicable Governmental Authorities, if and as appropriate, of any on-the-job injuries or workers compensation claims for which they are responsible for under this Section 6.6(h). Buyer will notify applicable Governmental Authorities, if and as appropriate, of any on-the-job injuries or workers compensation claims for which it is responsible for under this Section. Sellers and Buyer will cooperate in providing to each other information needed for these notifications and related filings. 

  

 Section 6.7 _Excluded Assets_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (a) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement exclude the Excluded Assets, (b) prior to the Closing Date, Sellers may take such reasonable actions which are necessary to exclude the Excluded Assets from the Interests and from the assets of the Companies, (c) neither Buyer nor any of the Companies shall have any right to use the Excluded Assets from and after the Closing Date and (d) Buyer shall be responsible for obtaining any and all licenses for computer and communications software that may be necessary for the ownership and operation of the Business from and after the Closing Date. With respect to the Excluded Assets described in clause (b) of the definition of Excluded Assets, Sellers shall require that such Contracts be fully terminated or assigned so that such Contracts are no longer included in the Interests and the Companies shall not have any liability under such Contracts. 

  

 Section 6.8 _Guarantees_. 

   

 (a) Buyer shall use Reasonable Efforts to assist Sellers in obtaining from the respective beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Sellers, on or before the Closing, valid and binding releases of Sellers and their respective Affiliates (other than the Companies), as applicable, from any liability or obligation, whether arising before, on or after the Effective Time, under the Guarantees, including by 

   ##### 

  

    

providing substitute guarantees with terms that are at least as favorable to
the counterparty as the terms of the applicable Guarantees and by furnishing
letters of credit, instituting escrow arrangements, posting surety or
performance bonds or making other arrangements as the counterparty may
reasonably request. If any Guarantee has not been released on the Closing
Date, then Buyer and Sellers shall continue to use their Reasonable Efforts
after the Closing to cause each such unreleased Guarantee to be released
promptly. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties acknowledge and agree that at any time on or after the Closing Date, any of Sellers and their respective Affiliates may, in its sole discretion, take any action to terminate, obtain release of or otherwise limit its liability under any and all outstanding Guarantees. 

   

 (c) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and their respective Affiliates from and after the Closing for any Losses arising out of or relating to any Guarantees. 

  

 Section 6.9 _Satisfaction of Liabilities_. 

   

 (a) Immediately prior to the Closing, (i) Sellers shall cause the Companies to distribute to Sellers or cancel any Indebtedness for Borrowed Money due to the Companies from Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Companies) and (ii) Sellers shall cancel (or, as applicable, cause their Affiliates to cancel) any Indebtedness for Borrowed Money due from the Companies to Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Companies), in each case including interest and other amounts accrued thereon or due in respect thereof. Sellers acknowledge that the tax effect of such transactions, if any, shall be reported on Sellers income tax returns for the period ending on the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) On the Closing Date, Enbridge Midcoast will cause the Companies to satisfy in full from the proceeds of the Purchase Price any Indebtedness for Borrowed Money of the Companies that exist immediately prior to Closing (other than Indebtedness for Borrowed Money due to or from the Companies that is addressed in Section 6.9(a)). 

  

 Section 6.10 _Update Information_. Prior to the Closing, each of Buyer and Sellers shall give the other party prompt written notice of any development that is reasonably likely to result in a failure of a condition to the Closing. At any time prior to the Closing, Sellers may, from time to time, by delivering prompt written notice to Buyer, supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule relating to representations and warranties of Sellers to include reference to any matter relating to Sellers, the Interests or the Companies which first arises or occurs after the date hereof and does not result from a breach by Sellers of the covenants set forth in Article VI. Any such supplement or amendment of any such Disclosure Schedule by Sellers under this Section 6.10 shall be effective to cure and correct any breach of any representation or warranty that would have existed absent such amendment or supplement, and Buyer shall have no right (other than to terminate this Agreement as provided in Section 10.1(b)), and hereby waives any and all rights, to bring any claim in respect of or relating to such breach of representation or warranty. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 6.11 _Seller Marks_. Buyer shall obtain no right, title, interest, license or any other right whatsoever to use the word "Enbridge" or "Midcoast" or any trademarks containing or comprising the foregoing, or any trademark confusingly similar thereto or dilutive thereof (collectively, the " _Seller Marks_ "). From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees (a) to cease using, and to cause each Company to cease using, the Seller Marks in any manner, directly or indirectly, except for such limited uses as cannot be promptly terminated ( _e.g_., signage, e-mail addresses, and as a referral or pointer to the acquired website), and to cease such limited usage of the Seller Marks as promptly as possible after the Closing and in any event within 180 days following the Closing Date, (b) to remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all Seller Marks from the Midcoast Assets and from all assets and all other materials owned, possessed or used by any of the Companies within 180 days after the Closing Date, (c) to use Reasonable Efforts to cause any third parties using or licensing Seller Marks in respect of the Midcoast Assets or on behalf of or with the consent of any Company, to remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all Seller Marks from all materials owned, possessed or used by such third parties within 180 days after the Closing Date and (d) to change the name of each of the Companies to remove the names "Enbridge" and "Midcoast" and any variations thereof and to amend all Organizational Documents of the Companies to reflect such name change within fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date. The Parties agree, because damages would be an inadequate remedy, that a Party seeking to enforce this Section 6.11 shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any breach thereof in addition to other remedies available at law or in equity. 

  

 Section 6.12 _Books and Records_. 

   

 (a) From and after the Closing, Sellers and their authorized Representatives may retain a copy of any or all of the data room materials and other books and records (other than Tax records which are addressed in Article VII) relating to the Midcoast Assets or to the business or operations of the Companies on or before the Effective Time. Sellers shall not use such materials and other books and records to compete with the Companies or the Midcoast Assets or in a manner that results in the violation of any Laws (including those of FERC and the KCC) or in a manner that results in a violation of any confidentiality obligation of the Companies or by which the Midcoast Assets are bound (provided Buyer uses Reasonable Efforts upon the request of Sellers to obtain a waiver of such confidentiality obligation). 

   

 (b) Except as otherwise contemplated in the Transition Services Agreement, within fifteen (15) days after the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer all books and records (other than Tax records which are addressed in Article VII) relating to the Midcoast Assets or to the business or operations of the Companies, including the electronic land records database (in a mutually accessible format such as Excel, Access or ASCII) and all prior environmental assessments relating to the Business or any of its assets or properties. Buyer shall preserve and keep a copy of all books and records (other than Tax records which are addressed in Article VII) relating to the Midcoast Assets or to the business or operations of the Companies on or before the Effective Time in Buyers possession for a period of at least seven (7) years after the Closing Date. After such seven (7) year period, before Buyer shall dispose of any such data room materials or books and records, Buyer shall give Sellers at least ninety (90) days prior notice to such 

   ##### 

  

    

effect, and Sellers shall be given an opportunity, at their cost and expense,
to remove and retain all or any part of such data room materials and books
and records as Sellers may select. Buyer shall provide to Sellers and their
designees (including its Affiliates) and their respective Representatives, at
no cost or expense to Sellers or such designees, full access to such data
room materials and books and records, including Tax records, as remain in
Buyers possession and full access to the properties and employees of Buyer
and the Companies in connection with matters relating to the Midcoast Assets
or to the business or operations of the Companies on or before the Effective
Time and any disputes relating to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.13 _Permits_.

On and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall obtain and maintain any and all insurance coverage and protection relating to the Business. 

  

ARTICLE VII 
  _TAX MATTERS_  

   

 Section 7.1 _Tax Returns_. 

   

 (a) With respect to Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the Companies on or prior to the Closing, Enbridge Midcoast shall cause the Companies to prepare all such Tax Returns and shall cause the Companies to pay all Taxes appropriately required to be due on such Tax Returns. With respect to Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the Companies after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Companies to prepare all such Tax Returns and, subject to the Sellers obligations described in Sections 7.4 and 7.5 to pay Buyer an amount equal to the amount of Taxes attributable to a taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), Buyer shall cause the Companies to properly file and pay all Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns; _provided, however_ , that any such Tax Returns with respect to income Taxes applicable to the Companies operations for any period ending on or before the Closing Date shall be prepared by Sellers and Sellers shall properly file and pay all Taxes shown to be due on such income Tax Returns. 

   

 (b) Any Tax Return prepared pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7.1 shall be prepared in a manner consistent with practices followed in prior years with respect to similar Tax Returns, except as otherwise required by law or fact. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) As a result of the Companies being disregarded as entities separate from EEP for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and state, local, and foreign Tax purposes where applicable), Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that the purchase of the Interests will be treated as a purchase by Buyer of the assets, subject to the liabilities, of each of the Companies for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and state, local, and foreign Tax purposes where applicable). Buyer and Sellers agree to report and file their U.S. federal income Tax Returns (and applicable state, local, and foreign Tax Returns) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with such treatment. 

  

 Section 7.2 _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer shall be responsible for and indemnify Sellers for the payment of all state and local transfer, sales, use, stamp, registration or other similar Taxes, if any, resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.3 _Purchase Price Allocation_. Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer and Sellers shall agree to allocate the Purchase Price (plus other capitalized costs) among the Midcoast Assets and the assets of the Companies in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Law, as appropriate). Buyer shall provide a proposed allocation to Sellers in writing at least 15 days prior to the Closing Date, and thereafter, Buyer and Sellers will act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with each other to agree on the final allocation prior to the Closing Date (as finalized, the " _Allocation Schedule_ "). Buyer and Sellers (or their applicable Affiliates) shall each file a Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement Under Section 1060) on a timely basis, reporting the allocation of the Purchase Price consistent with the Allocation Schedule. Buyer and Sellers (or their applicable Affiliates) shall file, on a timely basis, any amendments required to such Form 8594 as a result of a subsequent increase or decrease of the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement. Except as required by Law, Buyer and Sellers (or their applicable Affiliates) shall not take any position on their respective Tax Returns that is inconsistent with the allocation of the Purchase Price as so agreed or as adjusted. 

  

 Section 7.4 _Property Tax Allocation_. With respect to any real property, personal property, _ad valorem_ and other similar Tax (" _Property Taxes_ "), assessed on any of the assets of the Companies for a period that begins before and ends after the Effective Time (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the liability for such Property Tax shall be prorated on a daily basis between Buyer and Sellers as of the Effective Time, with Seller being liable for the portion of such Property Taxes equal to the product of (i) the amount of such Property Taxes for the entirety of the Straddle Period, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the day prior to the day that includes the Effective Time and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Straddle Period, and with Buyer being liable for the remainder of such Property Taxes. In the event the amount of Property Taxes reflected on a Property Tax bill, statement, or invoice for the Straddle Period that is apportioned to Sellers under this Section 7.4 exceeds the amount of such Property Taxes taken into account in calculating the Final Net Working Capital, Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for such excess within 5 days of the receipt by Sellers of Buyers written request for such amount, which shall include a copy of such Property Tax bill, statement, or invoice and appropriate supporting documentation for Buyers calculation of the amount due by Sellers to Buyer. In the event the amount of Property Taxes reflected on a Property Tax bill or statement for the Straddle Period that is apportioned to Sellers under this Section 7.4 is less than the amount of such Property Taxes 

   ##### 

  

    

included in the Final Net Working Capital, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for
such difference within 5 days of Buyers or a Companys receipt of such
Property Tax bill, statement, or invoice, which payment shall include a copy
of such Property Tax bill, statement, or invoice and appropriate supporting
documentation for Buyers calculation of the amount to be reimbursed. 

  

 Section 7.5 _Other Prorated Taxes_. With respect to Taxes (excluding Property Taxes, Transfer Taxes (as defined in Section 7.2) and federal, state or local income Taxes) (" _Other Prorated Taxes_ ") Buyer will deliver to Sellers copies of any Straddle Period Tax Return for Other Prorated Taxes that Buyer is obligated to prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 7.1 no later than ten business days before filing for approval by Sellers, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any such Tax Return must be accompanied with a calculation by Buyer pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.9 of the amount of the Taxes shown on such Tax Return that are attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. No later than three business days prior to the due date of any such Straddle Period Tax Return, the Sellers will pay to Buyer an amount equal to the amount of such Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to such calculation to the extent, if any, that such amount exceeds the sum of any estimated payments, deposits or credits made or applied prior to the Closing Date and any amount specifically reserved for such Tax liabilities included in the Final Net Working Capital computation with respect to Taxes. If Sellers disagree with such calculation, Sellers will not be relieved of their obligation to pay the amount resulting from such calculation, but may instead request that such calculation be reviewed by the Accountant. The decision of the Accountant will be final and binding upon the parties hereto, and Sellers and Buyer will each bear one-half of the fees and expenses of the Accountant. Buyer will pay to Sellers the amount, if any, by which the sum of any estimated payments, deposits or credits made or applied prior to the Closing Date with respect to such Tax for the Straddle Period exceeds the amount of such Taxes allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. 

  

 Section 7.6 _Tax Cooperation_. Each of Buyer and Sellers will provide the other party with such information and records and make such of its Representatives available as may reasonably be requested by such other party in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or any audit or other proceeding that relates to the Companies and the Midcoast Assets. 

  

 Section 7.7 _Tax Indemnification_. 

   

 (a) Sellers will indemnify, defend and hold the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from and against (i) all liability for Taxes of the Companies or attributable to the Midcoast Assets for any taxable period that ends before the Closing Date and the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the day prior to the Closing Date, (ii) all liability for income Taxes of any Seller or any other Person (other than the Companies) which is or has ever been affiliated with any of the Companies, or with whom any of the Companies otherwise joins or has ever joined (or is or has ever been required to join) in filing any combined or unitary Tax Return, prior to the Closing Date, (iii) all liability for any breach of Sellers representations and warranties contained in Section 4.10 or the Sellers covenants contained in this Section 7, and (iv) all liability for reasonable legal, accounting and appraisal fees and expenses with respect to any item described in clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) of this Section 7.7(a); _provided, however_ , that a Buyer Indemnified Party will not be entitled to indemnification hereunder to the extent an accrual of liability or a

specific reserve for such matter is included in the Final Net Working
Capital computation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers will not
indemnify, defend or hold harmless any member of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties from any liability for Taxes attributable to any action taken on the
Closing Date by Buyer, any of its Affiliates (including the Companies after
the Closing), or any transferee of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (other than
any such action taken in the ordinary course of business or
expressly required or otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement) (a
" _Buyer Tax Act_ "). 

   

 (b) Buyer will indemnify, defend and hold the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from and against (i) except to the extent any of the Sellers is otherwise required to indemnify Buyer for such Tax pursuant to Section 7.7(a), all liability for Taxes of each of the Companies for any taxable period beginning on or after the Closing Date and the portion of any Straddle Period beginning on or after the Closing Date, (ii) all liability for Taxes attributable to a Buyer Tax Act, and (iii) all liability for reasonable legal, accounting and appraisal fees and expenses with respect to any item described in clauses (i) or (ii) in this Section 7.7(b). 

   

 (c) The obligations of each party to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party or parties and other Persons, pursuant to Sections 7.7(a) and 7.7(b), will terminate upon the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any extensions thereof); _provided, however_ , that such obligations to indemnify, defend and hold harmless will not terminate with respect to any individual item as to which an Indemnified Party has, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim) to the applicable Indemnifying Party. 

   

 (d) In the case of any Straddle Period: 

   

 (i) Except as otherwise provided in this Article VII, the periodic Taxes of each of the Companies that are not based on income or receipts for the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the day prior to the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ") will be computed based on the ratio of the number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of days in the entire Tax period; and 

   

 (ii) Taxes of each of the Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than Taxes described in Section 7.7(d)(i)) will be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the Effective Time. 

   

 (e) Any indemnity payment required to be made pursuant to this Section 7.7 will be paid within 30 days after the Indemnified Party makes written demand upon the Indemnifying Party, but in no case earlier than five business days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are required to be paid (or would be required to be paid if no such Taxes are due) to the relevant Tax Authority (including estimated Tax payments). 

   ##### 

  

   

 (f) Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, including Article IX, the indemnification obligations of Sellers contained in this Section 7.7 represent the Sellers only indemnification obligations of Buyer with respect to Taxes. 

  

 Section 7.8 _Tax Contests_. 

   

 (a) If a claim is made by any Tax Authority which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment to any member of the Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 7.7, the Indemnified Party will promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim (a " _Tax Claim_ "); _provided, however_ , that the failure to give such notice will not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has actually been prejudiced as a result of such failure. 

   

 (b) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to Taxes and relating to a taxable period ending before the Closing Date or to any other taxable period in which any of the Companies income or operating results were includable on another Persons Tax Return, Sellers will control all proceedings and may make all decisions in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in their sole discretion pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Tax Authority with respect thereto, and may, in their sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner. Buyer will control all proceedings and may make all decisions in connection with any Tax Claim other than a Tax Claim described in the first sentence of this Section 7.8(b) or a Tax Claim described in Section 7.8(c) (including selection of counsel). 

   

 (c) Sellers and Buyer will jointly control and participate in all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of any Company for any Straddle Period. Neither Sellers nor Buyer will settle any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

   

 (d) Each of Buyer, the Companies and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Sellers and their respective Affiliates, on the other, will cooperate in contesting any Tax Claim, which cooperation will include the retention and (upon request) the provision to the requesting party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.

 (a) Subject to the provisions of this Article IX, from and after the Closing, Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, Buyers Affiliates and their respective Representatives (the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against all Losses that the Buyer Indemnified Parties incur arising from (i) any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of Sellers in this Agreement, (ii) the Retained Liabilities, (iii) the Excluded Assets, and (iv) the actions and matters described on _Schedule 9.2(a)_ relating to the claims asserted by the Public Service Commission of the State of Missouri. 

   

 (b) Subject to the provisions of this Article IX, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and their respective Affiliates and their Representatives, (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against all Losses that the Seller Indemnified Parties incur arising from (i) to the extent such Losses are not subject to the provisions of Section 9.2(a) and are not the subject of a claim notice delivered by Buyer by the date specified in Section 9.1, the Company Liabilities, (ii) any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of Buyer in this Agreement and (iii) the Assumed Obligations. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties shall have a duty to use Reasonable Efforts to mitigate any Loss (which duty shall include the obligation to seek and collect available insurance proceeds and indemnification and reimbursement payments and to claim and recognize available Tax Benefits) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 9.3 _Indemnification Procedures_. Claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows: 

   

 (a) Any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party claiming indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any claim asserted against the Indemnified Party by a third party (" _Third Party Claim_ ") in respect of any matter that is subject to indemnification under Section 9.2 shall promptly (i) notify the other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the Third Party Claim and (ii) transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (" _Claim Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Third Party Claim, a copy of all papers served with respect to such claim (if any), the Indemnified Partys best estimate of the amount of Losses attributable to the Third Party Claim and the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement.

If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim (such election to be without prejudice to the right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute whether such claim is an indemnifiable Loss under this Article IX), then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third Party Claim with counsel 

   ##### 

  

    

selected by the Indemnifying Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party), by all appropriate proceedings, to a final conclusion
or settlement at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with
this Section 9.3(b). The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such
defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof;
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement
agreement without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided further_ , that such consent shall not be required if (i) the
settlement agreement contains a complete and unconditional general release by
the third party asserting the claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by
the claim and (ii) the settlement agreement does not contain any sanction or
restriction upon the conduct of any business by the Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party
Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including the making of
any related counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third Party Claim
or any cross complaint against any Person. The Indemnified Party
may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third
Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section
9.3(b), and the Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with
respect to such participation. 

   

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.3(b), then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if the Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in regard to the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such defense and proceedings; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Partys consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 9.3(c), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation. 

   

 (d) Subject to the other provisions of this Article IX, a claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim may be asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought. 

   

 (e) In the event an Indemnified Party shall recover Losses in respect of a claim of indemnification under this Article IX, no other Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover the same Losses in respect of a claim for indemnification. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.3, the indemnification procedures set forth in Article VII shall control any indemnities relating to Taxes. 

  

 Section 9.4 _Limitations on Liability of Sellers_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein: 

   

 (a) a breach of any representation or warranty of Sellers in this Agreement (other than those in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.5 and 3.6, as to which this Section 9.4(a) is inapplicable) in connection with any single item or group of related items that results in Losses of less than $250,000 shall be deemed, for all purposes of this Article IX not to be a breach of such representation or warranty; 

   

 (b) Seller shall be liable for the first $5,000,000 of Losses that the Buyer Indemnified Parties actually incur under Section 9.2(a)(i) with respect to a breach of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement (other than those set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3(b), 3.5, 3.6, 4.1 and 4.2(b), as to which the limitations set forth in this Section 9.4(b) are inapplicable), and shall be liable for fifty percent (50%) of the next $20,000,000 of any such Losses that the Buyer Indemnified Parties actually incur under Section 9.2(a)(i) with respect to a breach of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement (other than those set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3(b), 3.5, 3.6, 4.1 and 4.2(b), as to which the limitations set forth in this Section 9.4(b) are inapplicable);  _provided, however_ , in no event shall Sellers indemnification obligation under Section 9.2(a)(i) with respect to a breach of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement (other than those set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3(b), 3.5, 3.6, 4.1 and 4.2(b) as to which this limitation will not apply) exceed $15,000,000. 

   

 (c) no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification under Section 9.2(a) to the extent Buyer has otherwise been compensated by reasons of adjustments (pursuant to Section 2.4) in the calculation of the Purchase Price relative to what it would have been absent such Loss; and 

   

 (d) the Parties have agreed upon the amounts set forth in Section 9.4(a) as a means of applying a materiality standard to the amount of any claim that a Buyer Indemnified Party may have against Sellers resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty by Sellers. Therefore, for purposes of determining whether any breach of the representations or warranties of Sellers has occurred and for purposes of calculating the dollar amount of Loss to which a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification, each of Sellers representations and warranties that contain any qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect will be deemed and interpreted to be a representation or warranty as to such items made without such qualification. Furthermore, for purposes of determining whether any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.11 has occurred after the Closing, all items scheduled on _Schedule 4.11_ shall be disregarded and deemed not to be set forth therein. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 9.5 _Waiver of Other Representations_. 

   

 (a) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, IT IS THE EXPLICIT INTENT OF EACH PARTY HERETO, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE, THAT NONE OF SELLERS OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES HAS MADE OR IS MAKING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO THE CONDITION, MERCHANTABILITY, USAGE, SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE INTERESTS, THE COMPANIES OR THEIR ASSETS, THE BUSINESS OR ANY PART THEREOF, EXCEPT THOSE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND WITHOUT IN ANY WAY LIMITING THE FOREGOING, SELLERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY TO BUYER WITH RESPECT TO ANY FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS OR FORECASTS RELATING TO THE MIDCOAST ASSETS, THE COMPANIES OR THE BUSINESS.

 (c) The representations and warranties contained in Section 4.11 shall be the exclusive representations and warranties with regard to Environmental Laws and related matters. 

  

 Section 9.6 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Parties agree to treat all payments made pursuant to this Article IX as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes. 

  

 Section 9.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. 

   

 (a) THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT EACH PARTYS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT FOLLOWING CLOSING SHALL BE PURSUANT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT. 

   

 (b) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, NO PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR LOST BENEFITS, LOSS OF ENTERPRISE VALUE, DIMINUTION IN VALUE OF ANY BUSINESS, DAMAGES TO REPUTATION OR LOSS TO GOODWILL,

WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM ANY OTHER PARTYS SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT

EXHIBIT 2.3(b)(viii) 

   

Attached to and made a part of that certain 
 Purchase and Sale Agreement dated October 9, 2007, by and among 
 Enbridge Midcoast Energy, L.P. and Midcoast Holdings No. One, L.L.C., as
"Sellers", 
 and 
 Quest Midstream Partners, L.P., as "Buyer"  

  

 _SELLERS GUARANTEE_   

 

GUARANTEE dated as of _ _ _ _ by
Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. (the " _Guarantor_ ") to and in favor of Quest
Midstream Partners, L.P. (the " _Beneficiary_ "). 

   

RECITALS 

   

 A. Enbridge Midcoast Energy, L.P., a Texas limited partnership (" _Enbridge Midcoast_ "), and Midcoast Holdings No. One, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (" _Midcoast Holdings_ "; together with Enbridge Midcoast hereinafter referred to as " _Sellers_ "), entered into that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement with the Beneficiary on October 9, 2007 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "). 

  

 B. Each Seller is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Guarantor. 

  

 C. To induce the Beneficiary to enter into the transactions contemplated under the Purchase Agreement, Sellers are required to deliver this Guarantee, duly executed by the Guarantor, to the Beneficiary at the Closing. 

  

 D. The guarantees provided in this Guarantee are reasonably expected to benefit, directly or indirectly, the Guarantor, and entering into and executing this Guarantee is in the best interest of the Guarantor. 

  

 E. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning given to such term in the Purchase Agreement. 

  

AGREEMENTS 

   

IN CONSIDERATION of the foregoing, the Guarantor agrees as follows:  

  

1\. Obligations 

  

The Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Beneficiary,
its successors and permitted assigns the due and punctual payment of all
present and future amounts payable by Sellers to the Beneficiary which arise
under Section 7.7 and Section 9.2(a) of the Purchase Agreement (collectively
the " _Obligations_ "). 

    ##### 

  

     

2\. Nature of Guarantee 

  

The liability of the Guarantor shall be absolute and unconditional
irrespective of any change in the name, objects, capital, corporate documents
or by-laws of either Seller or any amalgamation, merger or re-organization of
either Seller or, if a partnership, in the firm (in which case this Guarantee
shall apply to the corporation or partnership, as the case may be, resulting
or continuing there from). 

   

3\. Liability as Primary Debtor 

  

All debts, liabilities and obligations incurred by either Seller to the
Beneficiary under or pursuant to Section 7.7 and Section 9.2(a) of the
Purchase Agreement shall form part of the Obligations despite: (i) any
incapacity, disability, or lack or limitation of status, authorization or
power of such Seller or any of its directors, officers or agents (other
than incapacity, disability or lack or limitation of status, authorization or
power of which the Beneficiary has been given actual notice by such Seller or
the Guarantor); (ii) such Seller not being a legal entity, (iii) the
bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation of such Seller; (iv) any
lack of a written contract or of execution of documents by such Seller if such
Seller has agreed in writing with the Beneficiary to be bound by transactions
without such writing or execution. Any such debts, liabilities and
obligations which may not be recoverable from the Guarantor as guarantor
shall be recoverable from the Guarantor as principal debtor upon demand
and with interest, calculated and payable as provided in this Guarantee. 

   

4\. Continuing Guarantee 

  

This is a continuing guarantee and shall apply to and secure payment of all
Obligations and any ultimate unpaid balance thereof. This Guarantee shall be
reinstated if at any time any payment of any Obligation is rescinded or must
otherwise be restored or returned by the Beneficiary upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of a Seller or for any other reason whatsoever,
all as though such payment had not been made. 

   

5\. Term 

  

This Guarantee will remain in full force and effect until three (3) years from
the date hereof. Such termination shall not affect the Guarantors liability
for amounts due pursuant to Obligations with respect to (i) any written
notice of claim or demand given to Guarantor by Beneficiary prior to the
expiration of such three (3) year period, or (ii) transactions or agreements,
including extensions, renewals and amendments, entered into prior to the
effective date of such termination. 

   

6\. Right to payment 

  

Guarantors liability under this Guarantee will not be affected by the
existence, validity, enforceability, perfection or extent of any collateral
or security for the Obligations. The Beneficiary shall not be obligated to
file any claim relating to the Obligations if either Seller becomes subject
to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding and the failure of
the Beneficiary to do so shall not affect the Guarantors obligations under
this Guarantee. The Beneficiary shall not be bound to seek or exhaust its
recourse against Sellers or any other person or to realize on any security it
may hold in respect of the Obligations before being entitled to payment under
this Guarantee. The Guarantor renounces all benefits of discussion and
division. 

    ##### 

  

     

7\. Dealings by Beneficiary 

  

The Beneficiary may, without giving notice to or obtaining the consent of the
Guarantor, enter into agreements and transactions with Sellers, amend or
modify agreements with Sellers, settle or compromise any of the Obligations,
grant extensions of time and other indulgences, take and give up securities,
accept compositions, grant releases and discharges, whether full, partial,
conditional or otherwise, perfect or fail to perfect any securities, release
any undertaking, property or assets charged by any securities to third
parties and otherwise deal or fail to deal with Sellers and others
(including, without limitation, any other guarantors) and securities, hold
moneys received from Sellers and others or from any securities
unappropriated, apply such moneys against part of the Obligations and change
any such application in whole or in part from time to time, all as the
Beneficiary may see fit, without prejudice to or in any way discharging or
diminishing the liability of the Guarantor and no loss of or in respect of
any securities received by the Beneficiary from Sellers or any other persons,
whether occasioned through the fault of the Beneficiary or otherwise, shall
in any way discharge or diminish the liability of the Guarantor. 

   

8\. Payment 

  

If Sellers fail to pay any Obligation when due, the Guarantor will pay that
Obligation directly to the Beneficiary promptly upon the Beneficiarys demand
(" _Payment Demand_ ") in accordance with this Guarantee. Guarantor shall pay
such Payment Demand within five (5) Business Days. A Payment Demand shall be
in writing and shall reasonably and briefly specify in what manner and
what amount Sellers have failed to pay and an explanation of why such payment
is due, with a specific statement that Beneficiary is calling upon Guarantor
to pay under this Guarantee. A single written Payment Demand shall be
effective as to any specific default during the continuance of such default,
until Sellers or Guarantor has cured such default, and additional written
demands concerning such default shall not be required until such default is
cured. Payment Demand shall be delivered to the Guarantors address set forth
in this agreement or at such other address as the Guarantor may from time to
time designate to the Beneficiary in writing. 

   

9\. Waivers 

  

Guarantor waives notice of acceptance of this Guarantee and waives diligence,
presentment, protest, notice of protest, acceleration or dishonor and all
demands whatsoever other than the demand described in the preceding section
of this Guarantee. Any failure of the Beneficiary to exercise, and any delay
by the Beneficiary (other than a delay that gives rise to a defense under
an applicable statute of limitation) in exercising, any right, remedy or
power under this Guarantee shall not operate as a waiver of such right,
remedy or power. Any single or partial exercise by the Beneficiary of any
right, remedy or power under this Guarantee shall not preclude any other
or future exercise of any right, remedy or power. 

   

10\. Maximum Liability 

  

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Guarantee, Guarantors aggregate
liability (" _Guarantor s Liability Limit_") under this Guarantee is limited
to Fifteen Million United States Dollars (US $15,000,000). This Guarantee
shall cover and Guarantor shall pay, 

  ##### 

  

   

any reasonable enforcement costs and expenses to which the Beneficiary is
entitled under this Guarantee, provided that Guarantors obligation to pay
any such reasonable costs and expenses shall be subject to, and included
within, the Guarantors Liability Limit to the same extent as any
other liability incurred by Guarantor hereunder. 

  

Except to the extent that the Purchase Agreement expressly provides that
Sellers shall have liability for damages other than direct, actual damages,
THE LIABILITY OF THE GUARANTOR SHALL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT, ACTUAL DAMAGES AND
THE GUARANTOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST
BENEFITS, LOSS OF ENTERPRISE VALUE, DIMINUTION IN VALUE OF ANY BUSINESS,
DAMAGE TO REPUTATION OR LOSS TO GOODWILL. 

   

11\. Subrogation rights 

  

Until an Obligation has been paid in full, the Guarantor shall not have any
right to be subrogated to any rights of the Beneficiary with respect to that
Obligation. Upon payment of any of the Obligations, Guarantor shall be
subrogated to the rights of the Beneficiary against Sellers with respect to
that Obligation, and Beneficiary agrees to take, at the Guarantors expense,
such steps as the Guarantor may reasonably request to implement such
subrogation; provided, however, that Guarantor may not exercise any
subrogation right (and Beneficiary shall not be required to take any action
in connection therewith) until the expiration of three years from the date
hereof. 

   

12\. Taxes and Set-off 

  

All amounts payable by the Guarantor shall be paid without any deduction or
withholding (whether for duties, levies or taxes imposed, levied or assessed
by any authority or any other matter whatsoever) whatsoever unless and to the
extent that the Guarantor shall be prohibited by law from doing so, in which
event the Guarantor shall (i) forthwith pay to the Beneficiary an
additional amount so that the amount received by the Beneficiary will equal
the full amount of the Obligations and (ii) pay to the relevant authorities
the full amount of the deduction or withholding (including any deduction or
withholding on any additional amounts payable pursuant to this sentence).
The Guarantor reserves the right to set-off any amounts due by the
Beneficiary to Sellers under the Purchase Agreement against any payment due
under this Guarantee. 

   

13\. Representations and Warranties 

  

Guarantor hereby represents and warrants that (i) it is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its formation, (ii) the execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee
are within Guarantors powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary
action and do not violate Guarantors charter or by-laws or any law, order or
contractual restriction binding on Guarantor, (iii) any governmental and
other consents required with respect to the execution, delivery and
performance of this Guarantee by the Guarantor have been obtained and are in
full force and effect and all conditions of any such consents have been
complied with, and (iv) this Guarantee constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against it in accordance with
its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, 

  ##### 

  

   

insolvency, moratorium and other laws affecting enforcement of creditors
rights in general and general principles of equity). 

   

14\. Additional security 

  

This Guarantee is in addition and without prejudice to any security of any
kind (including, without limitation, any other guarantees, whether or not in
the same form) held by the Beneficiary. 

   

15\. Notices 

  

Notices under this Guarantee shall be provided in writing and shall be deemed
received if sent to the address or fax number specified below: (i) on the day
received if sent by courier delivery, (ii) on the next Business Day if sent
by facsimile transmission when sender has machine confirmation that the
notice was transmitted, or (iii) four Business Days after mailing if sent

else herein set forth, this Guarantee constitutes the entire agreement

understandings between such parties with respect thereto.

19\. Governing law and attornment 

  

This Guarantee shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of Texas. The Guarantor irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction
of the courts of Texas in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Guarantee. The Guarantor waives any objection to such jurisdiction on
the grounds that it is an inconvenient forum or any similar grounds. The
Guarantor consents to the service of process in any action or proceeding
relating to this Guarantee by notice to the Guarantor in accordance with the
notice provisions of this Guarantee. Nothing shall prevent the Beneficiary
from enforcing any related judgment against the Guarantor in any other
jurisdiction. 

  

The Guarantor has executed this Guarantee as of the date first above
written.
