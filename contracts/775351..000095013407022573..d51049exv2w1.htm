(iv)&nbsp;any lack of a written contract or of execution of documents by such Seller if such Seller has
agreed in writing with the Beneficiary to be bound by transactions without such writing or
execution. Any such debts, liabilities and obligations which may not be recoverable from the
Guarantor as guarantor shall be recoverable from the Guarantor as principal debtor upon demand and

Such termination shall not affect the Guarantor&#146;s liability for amounts due pursuant to Obligations

enforceability, perfection or extent of any collateral or security for the Obligations. The
Beneficiary shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Obligations if either Seller
becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding and the failure of the
Beneficiary to do so shall not affect the Guarantor&#146;s obligations under this Guarantee. The
Beneficiary shall not be bound to seek or exhaust its recourse against Sellers or any other person
or to realize on any security it may hold in respect of the Obligations before being entitled to
payment under this Guarantee. The Guarantor renounces all benefits of discussion and division.

Payment Demand shall be in writing and shall reasonably and briefly specify in what manner and what
amount Sellers have failed to pay and an explanation of why such payment is due, with a specific
statement that Beneficiary is calling upon Guarantor to pay under this Guarantee. A single written
Payment Demand shall be effective as to any specific default during the continuance of such
default, until Sellers or Guarantor has cured such default, and additional written demands
concerning such default shall not be required until such default is cured. Payment Demand shall be
delivered to the Guarantor&#146;s address set forth in this agreement or at such other address as the

described in the preceding section of this Guarantee. Any failure of the Beneficiary to exercise,
and any delay by the Beneficiary (other than a delay that gives rise to a defense under an
applicable statute of limitation) in exercising, any right, remedy or power under this Guarantee
shall not operate as a waiver of such right, remedy or power. Any single or partial exercise by
