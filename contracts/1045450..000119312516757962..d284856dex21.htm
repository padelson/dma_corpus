conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and EPR&#146;s current and proposed method of operation, including with the inclusion of the assets acquired as a result of the

retroactively, and to possibly different interpretations. Also, any variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the Prior Registration Statements or the Officers&#146; Certificate may affect the opinions expressed herein. Moreover,
EPR&#146;s continuing qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon EPR&#146;s ability to meet, through actual annual operating results, distribution levels and diversity of share ownership, the various qualification tests imposed under the Code.
We do not undertake to monitor whether EPR actually will satisfy such tests. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of EPR&#146;s operations for any taxable year will satisfy such requirements. </P>
