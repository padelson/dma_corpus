Attractions Purchaser by reducing the Share Consideration (in place of
reducing the Attractions Purchaser Closing Cash Consideration), as is
advisable by the Attractions Purchaser to ensure that the Interest Sale and
the Asset Sale to the Attractions Purchasers contemplated herein are all
taxable transactions for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes. Any adjustment to
the Share Consideration or replacement of the Share Consideration
for additional Attractions Purchaser Closing Cash Consideration pursuant to
this _Section 3.1(e)(iii)_ shall be made using the Closing VWAP as the deemed
value of the Attractions Purchaser Common Shares.

 

(f) The Parties agree that (i) the consideration paid by the Ski Purchaser to
the U.S. Ski Asset Sellers shall first be paid from the Note (or a portion
thereof), (ii) the Attractions Purchasers purchase of the Note (or a portion
thereof) from the U.S. Ski Asset Sellers shall be paid for with Share
Consideration, and (iii) the Attractions Purchaser may allocate its cash
consideration to the Company and/or any of the U.S. Attractions Asset Sellers
as needed to cause each transaction to be a fully taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Any adjustments to the purchase price resulting
from fluctuations in the value of the Attractions Purchaser Common Shares
between signing and Closing, or as a result of adjustments required by
_Sections 3.1(e)_ or _3.2_ , shall be applied to the consideration received by
the Equity Sellers. 

Section 3.2 _Post-Closing Adjustment to Consideration_.

 

Until the forty-fifth (45th) day following the Closing Date, the Seller
Parties and the Purchasers agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to
further adjust the Ski Purchaser Closing Cash Consideration, the Canadian
Purchaser Closing Consideration and the Attractions Purchaser Closing Cash
Consideration in accordance with  _Exhibit J_ as and when more complete and
accurate information becomes available to the Parties, with a final true-up to
occur with respect to all such adjustments as of the forty-fifth (45th) day
following the Closing Date (or such earlier time as may be agreed upon by the
Parties). In connection therewith, the Parties shall provide each other with
reasonable access to the books and records within their control for the
purpose of verifying any adjustments proposed to be made following Closing and
each Party proposing an adjustment following the Closing shall provide the
other Parties with appropriate documentation supporting such adjustment.

 



35 Section 3.3 _Buyback Options_.

 

In the event that between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, any party
to any of the Buyback Options shall have notified any Seller Party of its
intent to exercise its rights to purchase the assets of any Target Company or
any Asset Seller subject to the applicable Buyback Option, the Parties agree
that, to the extent applicable, (a) each of (x) the Ski Purchaser
Closing Cash Consideration, on the one hand, and (y) the Note, on the other
hand, shall be reduced on a _pro rata_ basis by the Net Cash Proceeds received
by the Company or its Affiliates for the applicable assets of such Target
Company or such Asset Seller and (b) each of (i) the Attractions Purchaser
Closing Cash Consideration, on the one hand, and (ii) the Share Consideration,
on the other hand, shall be reduced on a _pro rata_ basis by the Net Cash
Proceeds received by the Company or its Affiliates for the applicable assets
of such Target Company or such Asset Seller. The Company shall give prompt
written notice to the Purchasers of the written notice of exercise of any
Buyback Option. If any Buyback Option is exercised, the Company shall provide
the applicable Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on any proposed definitive purchase agreement or other similar agreement to be
entered into in connection with such exercise. The Company will promptly
provide the Purchasers with an executed copy of any purchase agreement or
other similar agreement entered into in connection with such Buyback Option.

and each Party shall take all positions for Tax purposes consistent

(b) No later than forty-five (45) calendar days after the Effective Date, the
Company and each Canadian Asset Seller shall provide the Canadian Purchaser
with a proposed schedule setting forth an allocation of the Jersey Canadian
Assets and the ULC Canadian Assets. The Company, each Canadian Asset Seller

such real and personal property shall be used solely for Title and transfer
tax purposes and no Party shall be required to agree to any allocation which
in its reasonable belief would result in its failure to qualify as a REIT.

 

Section 3.5 _Canadian Withholding_.

 

(a) The Jersey Trustee on behalf of the Jersey Trust shall take all reasonable
steps to obtain and deliver to the Canadian Purchaser a certificate issued by
the Canada Revenue Agency (the " _CRA_ ") under subsection 116(5.2) of the
_Income Tax Act_ (Canada) (a " _Clearance Certificate_ ") fixing therein an
amount equal to the proceeds of disposition, proposed proceeds of disposition
or such other amount as is reasonable in the circumstances (the " _Certificate
Limit_ ") of no less than the Jersey Canadian Closing Consideration, expressed
in Canadian dollars.

 

(b) The Canadian Purchaser shall be entitled to withhold from the Jersey
Canadian Closing Consideration fifty percent (50%) of the amount, if any, by
which the Jersey Canadian Closing Consideration exceeds the Certificate Limit
of any Clearance Certificate delivered, or if no Clearance Certificate is
delivered, the Canadian Purchaser shall be entitled to withhold from
the Jersey Canadian Closing Consideration an amount equal to fifty percent
(50%) of the Jersey Canadian Closing Consideration (the " _Withheld Amount_
"). The Withheld Amount shall be paid to the Escrow Agent at Closing and held
in trust by the Escrow Agent on the conditions set out in this _Section 3.5_
and an escrow agreement in the form of _Exhibit K_ to be entered into between
the Canadian Purchaser, the Jersey Trustee on behalf of the Jersey Trust and
the Escrow Agent (the " _Canadian Escrow Agreement_ ").

(c) Where the Canadian Purchaser has withheld the Withheld Amount and the
Jersey Trustee on behalf of the Jersey Trust delivers to the Canadian
Purchaser, after the Closing Date and on or before 28 days after the end of
the month in which the Canadian Purchaser acquires the Jersey Canadian Assets
(the " _Remittance Deadline_ "), (i) a Clearance Certificate having a
Certificate Limit of no less than the Jersey Canadian Closing Consideration,
the Canadian Purchaser shall direct the Escrow Agent to release and forthwith
pay to the Jersey Trust, by certified cheque, wire or bank draft, the

certified cheque, wire or bank draft, the Withheld Amount less fifty percent
(50%) of the amount by which the Jersey Canadian Closing Consideration exceeds
the Certificate Limit.

 

(d) Where the Canadian Purchaser has withheld the Withheld Amount and no
Clearance Certificate has been delivered to the Canadian Purchaser on or
before the Remittance Deadline, subject to _Section 3.5(e)_, the Canadian
Purchaser and Jersey Trustee on behalf of the Jersey Trust shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to remit such amount to the Receiver General for Canada (and the
amount so remitted shall be credited as a payment of the Jersey Canadian
Closing Consideration under this Agreement). Where the Canadian Purchaser has
withheld the

 



38  Withheld Amount and a Clearance Certificate has been delivered to the
Canadian Purchaser on or before the Remittance Deadline with a Certificate
Limit that is less than the Jersey Canadian Closing Consideration, subject to
_Section 3.5(e)_, the Canadian Purchaser and Jersey Trustee on behalf of the
Jersey Trust shall instruct the Escrow Agent to remit fifty percent (50%) of
the amount by which the Jersey Canadian Closing Consideration exceeds the
Certificate Limit to the Receiver General for Canada (and the amount so
remitted shall be credited as a payment of the Jersey Canadian Closing
Consideration under this Agreement). The Canadian Purchaser shall promptly
furnish the Jersey Trust with a receipt confirming that such remittance has
been made to the Receiver General for Canada on behalf of the Jersey Trust.

 

(e) Where the Canadian Purchaser has withheld the Withheld Amount and no
Clearance Certificate has been delivered to the Canadian Purchaser by the
Jersey Trustee on behalf of the Jersey Trust on or before the Remittance
Deadline in accordance with _Section 3.5(c)_, no portion of the Withheld
Amount shall be remitted to the Receiver General for Canada if the Jersey
Trustee on behalf of the Jersey Trust delivers to the Canadian Purchaser, on
or before the Remittance Deadline, a comfort letter issued by the CRA
forestalling the Canadian Purchasers remittance obligations under Section 116
of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada).

(f) Where the Canadian Purchaser has withheld the Withheld Amount and the
Jersey Trustee on behalf of the Jersey Trust has delivered to the Canadian
Purchaser a comfort letter as described in _Section 3.5(e)_, the Escrow Agent
shall continue to hold the Withheld Amount on the terms and conditions
outlined in the comfort letter issued by the CRA until either (i) all or a
portion of the Withheld Amount is paid to the Jersey Trust by certified
cheque, wire or bank draft, or (ii) all or a portion of the Withheld Amount is
remitted to the Receiver General for Canada for the account of the Jersey
Trust if notified to do so by the Receiver General for Canada. For greater
certainty, in cases of partial payments or remittances described in (i) and
(ii), respectively, above, any unpaid or unremitted portion of the Withheld
Amount shall continue to be held by the Escrow Agent as provided for under
the terms and conditions outlined in the comfort letter issued by the CRA.

 

(g) The provisions set forth in this _Section 3.5_ shall also apply, _mutatis
mutandis_ , to any positive adjustment to the amount paid by the Canadian
Purchaser and its permitted assigns to the Jersey Trust in consideration for
the purchase of the Jersey Canadian Assets.

 

Section 3.6 _PST_.

(a) Unless any Seller Party delivers on or before Closing:

(i) a certificate (a " _PST Clearance Certificate_ ") issued by the Minister
of Finance of British Columbia (" _Finance Minister_ ") under Section 187 of
the Provincial Sales Tax Act (British Columbia) (the "PST Act") to the effect
that all requisite taxes collectable and payable under the PST Act by Cypress
ULC have been paid, or evidence that Cypress ULC has entered into an
arrangement satisfactory to the Finance Minister for the payment of such
taxes; and

 

(ii) a certificate (a " _SST Clearance Certificate_ ") issued by the Finance
Minister under Section 99 of the Social Service Tax Act (British Columbia)
(the "SST Act") to the effect that all requisite taxes collected by Cypress
ULC have been paid, or evidence that Cypress ULC has entered into an
arrangement satisfactory to the Finance Minister for the payment of such
taxes,

then the Canadian Purchaser shall be entitled to withhold from the Canadian
Purchaser Closing Consideration payable to Cypress ULC an amount equal to
CDN$1,000,000 (the " _Withholding Sales Tax Amount_ "). The Withholding Sales
Tax Amount shall be held in trust on the conditions set out in this _Section
3.6_ and the escrow agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit L (the "
_Sales Tax Escrow Agreement_ ") to be entered into at Closing among the
Canadian Purchaser, Cypress ULC and the Escrow Agent. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Canadian Purchaser shall have no recourse against Cypress ULC in
respect of the Canadian Purchaser PST Liability or the Canadian Purchaser SST
Liability (each as defined below) for any amount in excess of the Withholding
Sales Tax Amount withheld from the Canadian Purchaser Closing Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 3.6_.

(b) Subject to _Section 3.6(c)_ , upon receipt by Canadian Purchaser from
Cypress ULC of the PST Clearance Certificate described in _Section 3.6(a)(i)_
and the SST Clearance Certificate described in _Section 3.6(a)(ii)_ , the
Canadian Purchaser and Cypress ULC shall instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly
pay the Withholding Sales Tax Amount to Cypress ULC.

 



39 (c) Upon receipt of notice by the Canadian Purchaser from the Finance Minister
to the effect that the Canadian Purchaser is liable for an amount (the "
_Canadian Purchaser PST Liability_ ") pursuant to the PST Act that is the
result of the Canadian Purchasers failure to obtain the PST Clearance
Certificate described in  _Section 3.6(a)(i)_ from Cypress ULC, or upon
receipt of notice by the Canadian Purchaser from the Finance Minister to the
effect that the Canadian Purchaser is liable for an amount (the " _Canadian
Purchaser SST Liability_ ") pursuant to the SST Act that is the result of the
Canadian Purchasers failure to obtain the SST Clearance Certificate described
in Section 3.6(a)(ii) from Cypress ULC, then unless alternative arrangements
are made to the reasonable satisfaction of the Canadian Purchaser, the
Canadian Purchaser and Cypress ULC shall instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly
pay an amount equal to the Canadian Purchaser PST Liability or Canadian
Purchaser SST Liability, as applicable, to the Finance Minister.

(d) Where the condition described in _Section 3.6(b)_ has not been satisfied
within twenty-four (24) months of the Closing Date, the Canadian Purchaser
and Cypress ULC shall instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly pay the
Withholding Sales Tax Amount to the Canadian Purchaser.

 

(e) Subject to _Section 3.6(f)_ , where any portion of the Withholding Sales
Tax Amount has been paid to the Canadian Purchaser pursuant to _Section
3.6(d)_ , the Canadian Purchaser agrees to be liable for any and all taxes,
interest and penalties under the PST Act and/or the SST Act for which Cypress
ULC is liable and shall indemnify and hold harmless Cypress ULC,
its successors, Affiliates, assigns, directors, officers, and shareholders,
whether direct or indirect, as applicable, from and against any and all losses
actually incurred by Cypress ULC in respect of such taxes, interest or
penalties.

 

(f) The indemnity obligations of the Canadian Purchaser set out in _Section
3.6(e)_ shall be limited in all respects to the amount of the Withholding
Sales Tax Amount actually remitted by the Escrow Agent to the Canadian
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 3.6(d)_.

(g) To the extent an amount is paid to the Finance Minister pursuant to this
_Section 3.6_ on account of taxes, interests or penalties for which Cypress
ULC is liable (or Canadian Purchaser is liable as a result of the ULC Canadian
Asset Sale), the Canadian Purchaser agrees to cooperate with Cypress ULC to
obtain a refund of such amount for the benefit of Cypress ULC, provided all
expenses in connection therewith are borne by the Cypress ULC.

 

(h) To the extent the Finance Minister seeks to recover at any time amounts
from the Canadian Purchaser in respect of any liability of Cypress ULC for
any taxes, interest and penalties under the PST Act and/or the SST Act and the
total of such amounts exceeds the Withholding Sales Tax Amount (such excess
amount referred to herein as the " _Excess Sales Tax Liability_ "), Cypress
ULC agrees to cooperate with and assist Canadian Purchaser in recovering such
Excess Sales Tax Amount from any third party (including, but not limited to,
Cypress Bowl Recreations Limited Partnership and any of its Affiliates), and
any amounts so recovered on account of any Excess Sales Tax Liability shall
be paid to the Finance Minister on account of any such Excess Sales Tax
Liability or to the Canadian Purchaser to the extent of any amounts previously
paid by the Canadian Purchaser to the Finance Minister on account of an
Excess Sales Tax Liability.

(i) For purposes only of this _Section 3.6_ , all references to "Cypress ULC"
shall be deemed to include Cypress ULC and its successors, Affiliates,
assigns, directors, officers, and shareholders, whether direct or indirect.

Company, their respective operators (including all Tenants and Managers of
each Company Property, as applicable) has complied and is in compliance with
all Laws which affect the Company Properties, and no notice, charge or
assertion has been received by any Seller Party, any Target Company, or, to
the knowledge of the Company, any Tenant or any Manager or, to the Companys
knowledge, threatened against any such Person alleging any non-compliance with
any such Laws, except in each case above for such non-compliance that has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 4.6(b)(1)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, each Target Company and each Asset Seller and, to the knowledge of
the Company, each of their respective operators (including all Tenants and

authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates, approvals, variances,
exemptions, orders, franchises, certifications and clearances of any
Governmental Authority and accreditation and certification agencies, bodies or
other organizations, including building permits, liquor licenses and
certificates of occupancy, necessary for each Target Company and each Asset
Seller to own, lease and, to the extent applicable, operate its properties or
to carry on its respective business substantially as it is being conducted as
of the Effective Date (the " _Target Company Permits_ "), and all such Target
Company Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except where the
failure to be in possession of, or the failure to be valid or in full force

have been duly made on a timely basis with the appropriate Governmental
Authority, except in each case for failures to file which, individually or in

to the knowledge of the Company, their respective operators, as applicable,
has received any claim or notice nor has any knowledge indicating that any
Target Company or any Asset Seller is currently not in compliance with the
terms of any such Target 

 



45  Company Permits. _Section 4.6(b)(2)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets
forth a true and complete list of all liquor licenses that are in the name of
Sellers as of October 28, 2016 as to any Company Property, and the Company
has provided to each Purchaser true and complete copies of all such liquor
licenses.

Section 4.7  _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

(a) The Company has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly available basis)
to, the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents required
to be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, including any amendments or supplements thereto, from and
after January 1, 2014, together with all certificates required pursuant to
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (collectively, the " _Company SEC Filings_ "). Each
Company SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its
date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent
amendment or supplement thereto, complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder and (ii) did not, at the time it was filed (or became effective in
the case of registration statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of
the date of the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or incorporated by
reference in the Company SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented or restated,
if applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was prepared
(except as indicated in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP applied on
a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each
such consolidated financial statement presented fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position, results of operations,
stockholders equity and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective
periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly
financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

 

(c) The Companys system of internal accounting controls is reasonably
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Companys principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the Companys auditors
and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) all significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect
the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
data, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal
controls, and the Company has made available to the Purchasers copies of any
material written materials relating to the foregoing. The Company has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is
defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) reasonably
designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company required
to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others

 



46  within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting the Companys principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer to material information required to be included in
the Companys periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. Since the
enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has made any prohibited loans to any director or executive
officer of the Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the
Exchange Act).

(d) Except as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against on the Companys
most recent balance sheet (or, in the notes thereto) included in the Company
SEC Filings, none of the Company, the Operating Partnership, any Seller or any
Target Company has any material liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities
or obligations (i) expressly contemplated by or under this Agreement,
including _Section 8.1_ hereof, (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since the most recent balance
sheet set forth in the Company SEC Filings made through and including the
Effective Date or (iii) that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Target Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(e) The Company has provided the Purchasers with true and correct copies of
unaudited financial statements for each Asset Seller and each Target Company
consisting of the balance sheet and statements of income (collectively, the "
_Property Financial Statements_ "). The Property Financial Statements fairly
present in all material respects the financial position of each Asset Seller
and each Target Company as of August 31, 2016, the results of their respective
operations for the periods indicated, all in conformity with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis. The Property Financial Statements have been
accurately derived from the books and records of the Asset Sellers and the
Target Companies, and there has been no material adverse change in the
financial condition of any Asset Seller or any Target Company since the most
recent period covered by such Property Financial Statement.

Section 4.8 _Disclosure Documents_.

supplemented or at the time such document is declared effective by the SEC,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, or (ii) the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first
mailed to the stockholders of the Company, at the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting, at the time the Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC
or at the Closing Date, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading. All documents that the Company is responsible for filing
with the SEC in connection with this Agreement, the Sale and the other
Contemplated Transactions, to the extent relating to any Seller Party or any
Target Company or other information supplied by or on behalf of the Company,
any other Seller Party or any Target Company for inclusion therein, will
comply as to form, in all material respects, with the

 



47  provisions of the Securities Act or Exchange Act, as applicable, and each
such document required to be filed with any Governmental Authority (other than
the SEC) will comply in all material respects with the provisions of any
applicable Law as to the information required to be contained therein.

any obligation with respect to, or has resulted in or will be reasonably
expected to result in any liability to, the Purchasers or any of their
Subsidiaries.

 

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a material
liability to any Target Company, no Seller Party or any Target Company or any

the Company Intellectual Property rights owned by or exclusively licensed to
any IP Holder; and (v) to the knowledge of the Company, no Third Party is

infringed or misappropriated, any Company Intellectual Property owned by
or exclusively licensed to any IP Holder. To the extent applicable, the IP

existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
the requisite organizational power and authority and any necessary
governmental authorization to own, lease and, to the extent applicable,
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. The Ski Purchaser is duly qualified or licensed to do business,
and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, operated or leased by it or the nature of its business makes
such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for such
failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that, individually
or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect pursuant to clause (2) of the definition
thereof.

(b) As of the Closing Date, the Canadian Purchaser shall be validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and
shall have the requisite organizational power and authority and any necessary
governmental authorization to own, lease and, to the extent applicable,
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is contemplated
under this Agreement. As of the Closing Date, the Canadian Purchaser will be
duly qualified or licensed to do business, and be in good standing, in each

necessary to authorize this Agreement, the Financing Documents to which it is
a party, the Ski Purchaser Interest Sale, the Ski Purchaser Asset Sale, the
Canadian Asset Sale or to consummate the other Contemplated Transactions to
be consummated by the Ski Purchaser. The Ski Purchaser Manager has duly and

and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the Seller
Parties, this Agreement constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of
the Ski Purchaser, enforceable against the Ski Purchaser in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable

or at law).

 

(c) As of the Closing Date, the Note will be duly executed and delivered by
the Ski Purchaser and each of the other obligors thereunder and the Note will

Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the
Company, the Attractions Purchaser or the Ski Purchaser which, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, the Attractions Purchaser or the Ski
Purchaser, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of

the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give the Company
Stockholder Approval, include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and

Approval (the " _Board Recommendation_ "), except to the extent that the
Company Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by
_Section 8.6(d)_ or _Section 8.6(f)_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to relieve the Company of its obligation to submit the Sale
to its stockholders for a vote on the approval thereof. The Company agrees
that, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
_Section 10.1_, its obligations to hold the Company Stockholder
Meeting pursuant to this _Section 8.4(d)_ shall not be affected by the

Company of any Company Acquisition Proposal or by any Adverse Recommendation
Change.

Section 8.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
contracts, and subject to the reasonable restrictions imposed from time to
time upon advice of outside counsel, the Company shall and shall cause each of
the Target Companies and the Asset Sellers to afford to the Purchasers and
their respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours and upon reasonable advance written notice to all of their respective
properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records. In

other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws, and (ii) all other information (financial
or

 



99  otherwise) concerning its business, properties and personnel either
Purchaser may reasonably request. No Purchaser shall be permitted to conduct
or cause to be conducted any environmental investigation or other invasive
sampling or testing (including but not limited to soil or ground water
sampling) of any Company Property based on information existing (whether known
or unknown) as of the date of this Agreement without the Companys prior
written consent, which consent shall be in the Companys sole discretion to
grant or deny; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company shall promptly notify the
Purchasers in writing of any new discovery of any Hazardous Substances on,
under or about any Company Property or any new knowledge by the Company of
suspected or actual violations of Environmental Laws on any such Company
Property, and the Purchasers shall be permitted to conduct or cause to be
conducted any environmental investigation or other invasive sampling or
testing (including but not limited to soil or ground water sampling) of any
such Company Property upon receipt of such written notice; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company shall provide each Purchaser, at its own
expense, with the right to such reasonable access to each Company Property
during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance written notice in
order to prepare or cause to be prepared surveys, inspections, engineering
studies, environmental assessments and other tests, examination or studies of
environmental matters relating to the Company Property that originates during
the Interim Period that the Company deems to be reasonably necessary, so long
as such access or activities do not unduly interfere with any Target Companys
or Asset Sellers operation of each such Company Property in the ordinary
course of business, and each Purchaser agrees that any information disclosed
or discovered from such activities will be subject to the provisions of the
applicable Confidentiality Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each
Purchaser will use its reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to
any Target Companys or Asset Sellers business that may result from its
requests for access, data and information hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither any Target Company nor any Asset Seller shall be required
by this  _Section 8.5_ to provide the Purchasers, their financing sources or
their respective Representatives with access to or to disclose information (w)
relating to the consideration, negotiation and performance of this Agreement
and related agreements, (x) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a Third Party entered into prior to the Effective Date or
entered into after the Effective Date in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Target
Companies and the Asset Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain the required consent of such Third Party to such access or disclosure),
(y) the disclosure of which would violate any Law or applicable fiduciary
duty ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure not in violation of any Law or applicable fiduciary duty), or (z)
that is subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal
privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Target Companies and the Asset
Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of any such
attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege).

 

(b) The Parties will hold, and will cause their respective Representatives and
Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information of the Company, the Target
Companies, the Asset Sellers or the Purchasers, as the case may be, in
confidence to the extent required by and in accordance with, and will
otherwise comply with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreements.

 

(c) The Company agrees to give prompt written notice to the Purchasers upon
becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or
circumstance relating to it, any of the Target Companies or any of the Asset
Sellers which could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Target Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



100 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and
subject to  _Section 8.21_ below, during the Interim Period, (i) each
Purchaser shall have the right to enter into discussions with any Tenant or
Manager in connection with efforts to enter into new leases to be effective
after the Closing Date with respect to the Company Properties and continue

undertaken prior to the Effective Date, (ii) each Purchaser shall provide the
Company with reasonable updates at reasonable times of its discussions with
such Tenants and Managers and (iii) the Ski Purchaser shall have the right to

be entitled to have a Representative of the Company Financial Advisor present
during such discussions (other than those described in clause (iii) above).
For the avoidance of doubt, the inability to obtain or execute new leases
shall not have any effect on any Purchasers obligations under this Agreement,
including the obligation to close if the conditions under _Article 9_ are met.

 

Section 8.6 _Company Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
during the Interim Period, neither the Seller Parties nor any of the Target
Companies nor any of their respective officers, directors, Affiliates or

encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, discussion, offer or request
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue, conduct, engage, maintain or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish

approve, endorse or recommend a Company Acquisition Proposal, (iv) enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,

purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other
similar definitive agreement providing for or relating to a Company
Acquisition Proposal or requiring the Seller Parties to terminate this
Agreement with any Third Party (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "),

any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in the
Company Charter or Company Bylaws inapplicable to any transactions
contemplated by a Company Acquisition Proposal or to any Third Party, (vi)

request under, any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which the
Company, the Sellers or any of the Target Companies is or becomes a party
(provided that the Company Board may waive any such standstill agreement if
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors duties under applicable Law), or (vii) resolve, agree,
approve, recommend or publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



101 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 8.6(a)_, at any time

unsolicited _bona fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party
made after the Effective Date, (i) furnish non-public information to such
Third Party (and such Third Partys Representatives) making a Company
Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) prior to so
furnishing such information, the Company receives from the Third Party an
executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) any non-public
information concerning the Company, the Sellers or the Target Companies that
is provided to such Third Party shall, to the extent not previously provided
to the Purchasers, be provided to the Purchasers prior to or simultaneously
with providing it to such Third Party) and (ii) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Third Party (and such Third Partys Representatives)
with respect to the Company Acquisition Proposal, in the case of each of
clauses (i) and (ii): if (x) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such
Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result
in, a Superior Proposal, and (y) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law.

_Section 8.6_, the Company shall notify the Purchasers promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours) after (i) receipt of any Company Acquisition
Proposal or any request for non-public information relating to the Company,
any Seller or any Target Company by any Third Party, or any inquiry from any
Person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with the Company relating
to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, a possible Company
Acquisition Proposal (such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in
writing and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Company
Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any Company

thereof if in writing and any related documentation or correspondence), or
(ii) it enters into any discussions or negotiations concerning any Company
Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data to any
Person in accordance with this _Section 8.6(c)_, and, in each case, the
Company shall keep the Purchasers reasonably informed of the status and terms
of any such Company Acquisition Proposals, inquiries, proposals, offers,
discussions or negotiations (including any material change to the financial
terms, conditions or other material terms thereof).

(d) Except as permitted by this _Section 8.6(d)_ and _Section 8.6(f)_, the
Company Board shall not (i) withdraw, amend, change, qualify, or publicly
propose to withdraw, amend, change or qualify, in a manner adverse to the
Purchasers the Board Recommendation or knowingly make any public statement
inconsistent with such Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt, endorse or
recommend (or publicly propose to approve, adopt, endorse or recommend) any
Company Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve, adopt, declare advisable or
recommend (or agree to, resolve or propose to approve, adopt, declare
advisable or recommend), or cause or permit the Company to enter into, any
Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in accordance with this _Section 8.6_) (each of clause
(i), (ii) and (iii), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if the Company Board
has received a _bona fide_ Company Acquisition Proposal (that did not result
from a breach of this _Section 8.6_) that, in the good faith determination of
the Company Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel

 



102  and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after having
complied with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be
offered by the Purchasers pursuant to  _Section 8.6(e)_, and such Company
Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn, and in such case the Company may (i)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)(ii)_, and/or (ii) make
an Adverse Recommendation Change (provided, that in the event of any such
termination, the Company complies with its obligation to pay the Company
Termination Amount pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)(i)_).

 

(e) The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 8.6(d)_ or  _Section 8.6(f)_
unless (i) the Company has provided a written notice (a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ ") to the Purchasers that the Company intends to take such action,
specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor and describing the
material terms and conditions of, and attaching a complete copy of, the
Superior Proposal and the terms of any and all agreements in connection
therewith, including any financing arrangements, that is the basis of
such action, (ii) during the four (4) Business Day period following the
Purchasers receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with the Purchasers in good
faith (to the extent the Purchasers desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (iii)
following the end of the four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, taking into account any changes to this
Agreement proposed in writing by the Purchasers in response to the Notice of
Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the
Notice of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal, and the
Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
_Section 8.6(e)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that references to the four (4)
Business Day period above shall then be deemed to be references to a period
of time that is the longer of (x) two (2) Business Days and (y) the remainder
of the original four (4) Business Day period.

 

(f) Notwithstanding _Section 8.6(a)_, but subject to the provisions of
_Section 8.6(e)_, in response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board
may, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and
other than in response to a Company Acquisition Proposal, effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change if the Company Board has determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that, in light of such
Intervening Event, the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors duties under applicable Law. Subject to the Companys
compliance, in all material respects, with _Section 8.6(d)_, _(e)_ and
_(f)_ the Company may take and/or disclose to the stockholders of the Company
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any such statement(s) (other than a "stop, look and listen communication"
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, and within
the time period contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)(3)) shall be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change, unless the Company Board expressly publicly
reaffirms the Board Recommendation in such statement.

 

(g) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Seller Parties and the Target
Companies and their respective officers, directors and employees shall, and
the Company shall instruct the

 



103  Sellers Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing discussions, negotiations or communications with any Person
conducted prior to the Effective Date with respect to any, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a, Company Acquisition Proposal and shall
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished in connection therewith. From and after the Effective
Date, the Company, the Sellers and the Target Companies and their respective
officers, directors and employees shall, and the Company shall instruct and
cause its and the Target Companies Representatives to, take such action as
is necessary to enforce any confidentiality agreement (including standstill
provisions) or provisions of similar effect to which the Company, the Sellers
or any of the Target Companies is a party or of which the Company, the Sellers
or any of the Target Companies is a beneficiary.

(h) References in this _Section 8.6_ to the "Company Board" shall include a
duly authorized committee thereof.

(i) " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal or offer for
(or expression by a Third Party that it is considering or may engage in),
whether in one transaction or a series of related transactions, (i) any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar
transaction involving the Company (excluding for these purposes, any such
transaction involving assets not contemplated to be transferred, directly or
indirectly, pursuant to this Agreement), the Sellers or the Target Companies,
(ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, license, transfer or
other disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, sale of
equity interests, share exchange, joint venture, business combination or
otherwise, of any assets of the Company, the Sellers or the Target Companies
representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company, the Sellers and the Target Companies, taken as a whole as determined
on a book-value basis (excluding for these purposes, any assets not
contemplated to be transferred, directly or indirectly, pursuant to this
Agreement), (iii) any issue, sale or other disposition of (including by way of
merger, consolidation, joint venture, business combination, share exchange or
any similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase, or securities convertible into, such securities) representing twenty
percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the Company, (iv) any tender
offer or exchange offer in which any Person or "group" (as such term is
defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall seek to
acquire beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act), or the right to acquire beneficial
ownership, of twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding shares of any
class of voting securities of the Company or (v) any recapitalization,
restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other similar type of transaction
with respect to the Company in which a Third Party shall acquire beneficial
ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding shares of any
class of voting securities of the Company, the Sellers or the Target
Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that the term "Company Acquisition
Proposal" shall not include the Sale or the other Contemplated Transactions.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a _bona fide_ written Company
Acquisition Proposal (except that, for purposes of this definition, the
references in the definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" to twenty
percent (20%) shall be replaced by fifty percent

 



104  (50%)) (that did not result from a breach of _Section 8.6_) made by a Third
Party that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and taking into
account all financial, legal, regulatory and any other aspects of the
transaction described in such proposal that the Company Board deems relevant,
as well as any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by any
Purchaser in response to such proposal or otherwise, to be (A) more favorable
to the Company and its stockholders (solely in their capacity as such) from a
financial point of view than the Sale and the other Contemplated
Transactions, and (B) reasonably likely to receive all required approvals on a
timely basis and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on a timely
basis on the terms proposed.

 

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any material event, circumstance, change,
effect, development or condition (other than, and not related in any way to,
a Company Acquisition Proposal) that was not known to, nor reasonably
foreseeable by any member of the Company Board, assuming consultation with the
executive officers of the Company, as of or prior to the Effective Date. For
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall (A) the receipt of, or proposal or
inquiry from any Third Party relating to, a Company Acquisition Proposal or
(B) changes in the market price or trading volume of the
Attractions Purchaser Common Shares, or the fact that any Purchaser fails to
meet or exceed internal or published projections, forecasts or revenue or
earnings predictions for any period, be deemed to be an Intervening Event (it
being understood that the underlying causes of any such changes or failures
may be taken into account in determining whether an Intervening Event has
occurred).

Authority vacated or reversed, the avoidance of each and every impediment
under any antitrust, merger control, competition or trade regulation Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Sale so as
to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, _provided_ that
decisions to defend any lawsuits or other Legal Proceedings based on or
involving antitrust claims will be in the sole discretion of the Ski Purchaser
and

 



105  should the Ski Purchaser decide to defend any such lawsuits or other Legal
Proceedings, it shall have the right to direct all matters related to such

Affiliate thereof) to divest or otherwise dispose of any Purchaser Property or
(y) the Ski Purchaser (or any Affiliate thereof) to divest or otherwise
dispose of any of its property, or otherwise take or commit to take any action
that limits the Ski Purchasers (or its Affiliates) freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, the Ski Assets or any material portion
thereof, or any of its (or their) other assets or businesses, and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate

Agreement (including this  _Section 8.7_), none of (A) the Ski Purchaser,
(B) the Canadian Purchaser, (C) any of their respective Affiliates or
Subsidiaries or (D) any Representative or direct or indirect owner of any of

however, that, to the extent practicable, the Ski Purchaser shall consult with
the appropriate Seller Party and consider in good faith the views of such
Seller Party with respect to the information related to the Seller Parties
that appears in any such filing, application, notification or other document.
Each of the Ski Purchaser and the appropriate Seller Party agree, subject to

to be submitted to, any Governmental Authority by the appropriate Seller Party
in connection with the Sale and the other Contemplated Transaction, and (B)
the appropriate Seller Party and its Representatives shall not participate
independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with
any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other
inquiry without giving the Ski Purchaser or its outside counsel prior notice

consenting to any leasehold mortgage financing secured by the lessees

required with respect to the Sale and the other Contemplated Transactions,
and (iii) such New Forest Service Permits and Ground Lease Approvals have not
been obtained as of the Effective Date. The applicable Purchaser shall pay all
customary administrative fees and expenses charged by any (A) Forest Service
Authority in connection with obtaining any New Forest Service Permit or (B)
Ground Lessor in connection with obtaining any Ground Lease Approval,
including without limitation, any and all Third Party
customary administrative fees and expenses incurred by the Sellers in
connection with obtaining such Ground Lease Approvals, to the extent all such
customary administrative fees and expenses have been previously disclosed and
agreed in writing to be paid by the applicable Purchaser; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all other sums, costs and expenses necessary to obtain the
New Forest Service Permits, the Ground Lease Approvals and/or any other
consents or approvals from Third Parties that exceed the amounts stated in

_Other Costs_ ") shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by the Company and fifty
percent (50%) by the applicable Purchaser (provided that the aggregate amount
paid by each of the Company, on the one hand, and both of the Purchasers
(together on a collective basis), on the other hand, shall not
exceed $500,000, respectively (inclusive of all amounts paid by the Company
and the Purchasers in respect of Release Costs as set forth below)). The
Attractions Purchaser, the Ski Purchaser and the Company shall, and shall
cause their respective Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to

after the Effective Date. The Attractions Purchaser (with respect to the
Attractions Assets) and the Ski Purchaser (with respect to the Ski Assets),
as applicable, will commence and lead all negotiations with the relevant
Persons with respect to obtaining the New Forest Service Permits and the
Ground Lease Approvals. In connection therewith, the Company shall

Representatives to promptly provide, and shall request the Tenants to promptly
provide, all assistance and cooperation reasonably requested by the Purchasers
in connection with obtaining such New Forest Service Permits and Ground Lease

the Attractions Target Companies) from all guarantees or other obligations
relating to the Ground Leases at Wild

 



108  Waves, including, without limitation, by providing such Ground Lessors with
replacement guarantees as of the Closing from the Attractions Purchaser. The
Attractions Purchaser shall pay and be responsible for all costs and Expenses
incurred in connection with the release of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of such guarantees and obligations to the extent such fees and
expenses are required pursuant to the terms of the Ground Leases at Wild
Waves or have been previously disclosed and agreed to be paid by the
Attractions Purchaser in writing (collectively, " _Release Costs_ ").
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (1) no Party shall
pay any sum, expense or cost (or enter into any agreement, instrument or
other understanding to provide any economic benefits or services) pursuant to,
or in connection with, this Agreement (including this _Section 8.7(g)_) that
would be in violation of any applicable Law or reasonably likely to result in
a violation of applicable Law (as reasonably determined by counsel to the
proposed paying Party) and (2) the Parties agree that none of the Ski Parties,
the Attractions Purchaser or the Company shall be subject to any liability or
damages resulting from, or arising out of, and none of the Ski Parties, the
Attractions Purchaser or the Company shall be deemed to have acted
unreasonably in connection with, the Ski Purchasers, the Attraction
Purchasers or the Companys election to not pay Other Costs in excess of the
applicable expenditure cap described in this _Section 8.7(g)_, in each case,
with respect to the Ski Parties, the Attractions Purchaser or the Company,
regardless of whether any such election directly or indirectly results (or
would be reasonably likely to result) in the failure to consummate the Sale
and/or the other Contemplated Transactions.

 

(h) The Ski Purchaser and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Missing Ground
Lessor Estoppel Letters and the Missing Tenant Estoppel Letters. The Ski

obtaining the Missing Tenant Estoppel Letters. In connection therewith,
the Company shall promptly provide, and cause each of its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives to promptly provide, and shall request the
Tenants to promptly provide, all assistance and cooperation reasonably
requested by the Ski Purchaser in connection with obtaining the Missing
Tenant Estoppel Letters, including the preparation and delivery of any
information regarding any Tenant, the Ground Leases, and the Company Leases as

with, and communications from, the relevant Persons. The Company shall
continue to lead all negotiations with the relevant Persons with respect to
obtaining the Missing Ground Lessor Estoppel Letters. In connection
therewith, the Ski Purchaser shall promptly provide, and cause each of its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to promptly provide, all

Ski Purchaser, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
include in the Missing Ground Lessor Estoppels Letters and the Missing Tenant
Estoppel Letters such additional information and certifications as Ski
Purchaser may request ( _i.e_., information and certifications that are in
addition to the criteria set forth on _Schedule 2.11(b)(xviii)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter), provided that the inclusion of such additional information
and certifications in such estoppel letters shall not be a condition to
Closing. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement
(including  _Section 8.7(g)_), no Party shall be required to pay any sum,
expense or cost pursuant to this Agreement (including this _Section 8.7(h)_)
to any Ground Lessor or to any Tenant to obtain the Missing Ground Lessor
Estoppel Letters and/or the Missing Tenant Estoppel Letters.

 



109 (i) If at any time after the Closing any further action is necessary or
reasonably desirable to carry out the purpose of this Agreement, each Party

(b) In addition, without limiting the foregoing, each Party shall give
prompt notice to the other Parties if (i) any representation or warranty made
by it contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that the

, that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,

the Parties under this Agreement.

 

(c) Each Party shall give prompt notice to the other Parties of any Legal
Proceeding commenced or, to such Partys knowledge, threatened against,

Asset Sellers or the Subsidiaries of the Purchasers which relate to this
Agreement, the Sale or the other Contemplated Transactions. The Seller Parties
shall give the Purchasers the opportunity to reasonably participate in the
defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company, the
Sellers and/or its respective directors relating to this Agreement, the Sale
and the other Contemplated Transactions, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without the Purchasers prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

or make any such public statement or filing prior to obtaining the other
Parties consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party may, based on
the advice of outside counsel, without obtaining the other Parties consent,
issue such press release or make such public statement or filing as may be
required by Law, Order or the applicable rules of any stock exchange or the
applicable provisions of any listing agreement of any Party hereto. If for
any reason it is not practicable to consult with the other Party before making
any public statement with respect to this Agreement, the Sale or any of the
other Contemplated Transactions, then the Party making such statement shall
not make a

 



110  statement that is inconsistent with public statements or filings to which

minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes, including, at the request of any
Purchaser causing any Seller or any Purchaser, as applicable, to contribute
some or all assets located in the State of New York being purchased hereto to
one or more new limited liability companies or other entities and selling the
interests in such new entity or entities to any of the Purchasers or its
Affiliates, as the case may be. Notwithstanding _Section 2.5(b)_ hereof, all

this Agreement that are imposed, payable, collectible or incurred shall be
borne by the Attractions Purchaser, the Ski Purchaser, the Canadian Purchaser
or the Company, as the case may be, as set forth on _Exhibit N_ to this
Agreement.

(b) For U.S. federal and applicable state Income Tax purposes, the
Parties agree that the Sale shall be treated as the purchase of the Purchased
Assets and the underlying assets owned by the Target Companies (or any
disregarded entities owned by the Target Companies) in a fully taxable
transaction (and not a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code) and each Party shall file all Income Tax Returns and take
all positions for U.S. federal and applicable state Income Tax purposes
consistent with the foregoing.

 



111 (c) The Company, on the one hand, and the Purchasers, on the other hand, agree
to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly
as practical, such information (including reasonable access to books and
records) and assistance as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax
Return, the conduct of any Tax audit, and for the prosecution or defense of
any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax matter. The Company and the
Purchasers shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Tax audit or
other Tax proceedings and each shall execute and deliver such powers of
attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this
_Section 8.12(c)_.

(d) All Tax sharing or similar agreements to which any Target Company is a

execute an election to have subsection 167(1) of the _Excise Tax Act_ (Canada)
(the " _Section 167 Election_ ") apply to the ULC Canadian Asset Sale such
that no tax is payable under Part IX of the _Excise Tax Act_ (Canada) ("
_GST_ ") in respect of such sale. The Canadian Purchaser will file the 167
Election with the applicable Governmental Authority within the time prescribed
by the _Excise Tax Act_ (Canada).

(ii) The Canadian Purchaser covenants and agrees that, the Jersey Canadian
Asset Sale meets the requirements set forth in paragraphs 221(2) and 228(4)
of the _Excise Tax Act_ (Canada) such that Jersey Trust shall not be required
to collect any GST in connection with the Jersey Canadian Asset Sale, and the
Canadian Purchaser shall be liable for, shall self-assess and remit to the
Canada Revenue Agency within the manner and time prescribed by the _Excise Tax
Act_ (Canada) all GST which is payable in connection with the Jersey Canadian
Asset Sale.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) if it is determined by the CRA (or
any other relevant tax authority) that the Section 167 Election was not
applicable to the ULC Canadian Asset Sale, or (B) if the Canadian Purchaser
fails to satisfy its obligations described in _Section 8.12(e)(ii)_ or if
there exists any inaccuracy, misrepresentation or misstatement therein, then
the Canadian Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Canadian
Asset Sellers, each of their respective successors, Affiliates, assigns,
directors, officers, trustees, shareholders and beneficiaries, whether direct
or indirect, as applicable, from and against any and all losses actually
incurred by such parties as a result and will, immediately upon demand, pay to
the applicable Canadian Asset Seller (or other indemnified party) the
applicable GST (together with any applicable interest or penalties). Each
Canadian Asset Seller (or indemnified party) agrees to remit any such GST
(together with any applicable interest or penalties) to the CRA (or other
relevant tax authority), and assist the Canadian Purchaser, acting
reasonably, with respect to its input tax credit claim.

(f) Where applicable, the Canadian Asset Sellers and the Canadian Purchaser
agree to file an election with respect to the accounts receivable under
Section 22 of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) and the corresponding sections of
any other applicable provincial statute and any regulations under
such statutes in a manner consistent with the purchase price allocation
determined in accordance with _Section 3.4_.

the applicable Management Agreement, effective as of no later than December
1, 2016, and the Company shall enter into new Management Agreements with
Premier Parks, LLC or its Affiliate, in a form acceptable to the Company, upon
the termination of the Old Management Agreements. To the extent that
a termination of an Old Management Agreement results in a termination fee
payable under such Old Management Agreement that would not have been payable
if such Old Management Agreement were not terminated pursuant to this _Section
8.13_, the Attractions Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller Parties for any
such termination fee. The Attractions Purchaser shall pay (or reimburse, as

Companies as in effect on the Effective Date; _provided_ , that, any Covered
Person shall be entitled to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law for any acts or
omissions that occurred on or prior to the Closing Date, notwithstanding the

Covered Persons that were in effect at the time of the act or omission in
question. In addition, for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date,
the applicable Purchasers shall not, and shall not permit any of its

Condemnation. Seller Parties will neither cause, consent to nor permit any
Seller Party or Tenant to: (x) adjust, agree to or settle any such claim or

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, no Seller Party will effect
or consent to any repair, replacement or restoration of a damaged or taken
Company Property or Purchased Assets, other than repairs required to protect

shall be made within five (5) Business Days of termination;

(iv) (A) by the Company pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)(i)_, (B) by the Company
pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)(i)_ if at the date of such termination the
Company was entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
10.1(c)(i)_, or (C) by any Purchaser pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)(ii)_ (in
respect of any Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise

 



123  prohibiting the consummation of the Sale or the other Contemplated
Transactions under the HSR Act), if such termination pursuant to _Section
10.1(b)(ii)_ occurs after the date on which the Proxy Statement is first
mailed to stockholders of the Company, then the Purchasers, on a joint and
several basis, shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company an amount equal

respect to clause (C), (i) the Companys Reimbursable Expenses shall not
exceed $1,500,000, and (ii) the Ski Purchaser shall not have any obligation to
pay any of the Companys Reimbursable Expenses pursuant to this Section

(ii) (x) under no circumstances shall the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Amount on more than one occasion and (y) under no

Termination Amount on more than one occasion.

 

(c) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 10.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) each of the Company Termination Amount and the
Purchaser Termination Amount is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Purchasers or the
Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Sale and the other Contemplated
Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision, and (iii) without these agreements, none of the Attractions
Purchaser, the Ski Purchaser nor the Company would enter into this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including _Section
10.2_), in the circumstance in which the Company is required to pay the
Company Termination Amount, the Purchasers right to receive payment of the
Company Termination Amount and, if applicable, the Purchasers Reimbursable
Expenses from the Company shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Purchasers against the Company, the Sellers and their respective Subsidiaries
and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors,
partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or agents for

 



124  the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Sale to be consummated,
and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company, the Sellers, any of
their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members,
Affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, the Sale or the other
Contemplated Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement (including Section 10.2), in the circumstance in which the
Purchasers are required to pay the Purchaser Termination Amount, the Companys
right to receive payment of the Purchaser Termination Amount and, if
applicable, the Companys Reimbursable Expenses from the Purchasers shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller Parties against the Purchasers,
their permitted assigns, their Subsidiaries and any of their respective
former, current or future officers, directors, trustees, partners,
stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or agents for the loss suffered as
a result of the failure of the Sale to be consummated, and upon payment of
such amount, none of the Purchasers, their permitted assigns, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, trustees, partners, stockholders, managers, members,
Affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, the Sale or the other Contemplated
Transactions.

 

(d) _Payment of Termination Amount_.

 

(i) If either of the Company or the Purchasers is required to pay the
Termination Amount to the other, all or a portion of such Termination Amount
shall, if requested by the applicable payee, be paid into escrow on the date
such payment is required to be paid by the Company or the Purchasers, as
applicable, pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an escrow account designated in writing by the applicable
payee. In the event that either of the Company or the Purchasers is obligated
to pay the Termination Amount, the amount payable in any tax year of the party
receiving the Termination Amount shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the
Termination Amount, and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be
paid to the Party receiving the Termination Amount without causing such Party
to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code
for the relevant tax year, determined as if the payment of such amount did not
constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code ("
_Qualifying Income_ ") and such Party has $1,000,000 of income from unknown
sources during such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any
known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in each case, as
determined by such Partys independent accountants, plus (B) in the event the
Party receiving the Termination Amount receives either (x) a letter from such
Partys counsel indicating that such Party has received a ruling from the IRS
as described below in this  _Section 10.3(d)_ or (y) an opinion from such
Partys outside counsel as described below in this _Section 10.3(d)_, an
amount equal to the excess of the Termination Amount less the amount payable
under clause (A) above.

(ii) To secure the Companys and each Purchasers respective obligations to
pay these amounts, the Company or the Purchasers, as applicable, shall
deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Termination Amount with an
escrow agent selected by the applicable payee on such terms (subject to this
_Section 10.3(d)_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company, the
Purchasers and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the
Termination Amount by the Company and the Purchasers, as applicable, pursuant
to this _Section 10.3(d)_ shall be made at the time the Company or the
Purchasers, as applicable, is obligated to

 



125  pay the other Party such amount pursuant to _Section 10.3_ by wire
transfer. With respect to the Attractions Purchaser or the Company, the escrow
agreement shall provide that the Termination Amount in escrow or any portion
thereof shall not be released to the Company or the Attractions Purchaser, as
applicable, unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the
following: (i) a letter from the independent accountants of the Party
receiving the Termination Amount indicating the maximum amount that can be
paid by the escrow agent to such Party without causing such Party to fail to
meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as
if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and such
Party has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which is
not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which
is not Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow agent shall release such
amount to such Party, or (ii) a letter from counsel to the Party receiving the
Termination Amount indicating that (A) such Party received a ruling from the
IRS holding that the receipt by such Party of the Termination Amount would
either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income
within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (B) such
Partys outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the
receipt by such Party of the Termination Amount should either constitute
Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent
shall release the remainder of the Termination Amount to such Party. Each of
the Company and the Purchasers agrees to amend this _Section 10.3(d)_ at the
reasonable request of the other Party in order to (i) maximize the portion of
the Termination Amount that may be distributed to the Company or the
Purchasers, as applicable, hereunder without causing such Party to fail to
meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (ii) improve
such Partys chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this _Section
10.3(d)_ or (iii) assist such Party in obtaining a favorable legal opinion
from its outside counsel as described in this  _Section 10.3(d)_. Any amount
of the Termination Amount that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year
shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject
to the foregoing limitations of this  _Section 10.3(d)_, _provided_ that the
obligation of the Company or the Purchasers, as applicable, to pay the unpaid
portion of the Termination Amount shall terminate on the December 31 following
the date which is five (5) years from the Effective Date.

Section 10.4 _Amendment; Delegation_.

 

Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended,
modified, and supplemented by mutual agreement of the Parties hereto at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and prior to
the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment of this
Agreement which by applicable Law requires the further approval of the
stockholders of the Company without such further approval of such
stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the Parties hereto. Each Seller hereby grants and
delegates to the Company authority to enter into any amendment, grant any
waiver or provide any consent as the Company shall determine. Each Seller
acknowledges and agrees that any payment to be made to them by the Purchasers
pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid to the Company and the Company shall
receive such payments as agent on behalf of each Seller.

only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party or Parties
to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the
Party or Parties in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any other right hereunder. Any waiver shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given
and shall not constitute a waiver to any subsequent or other exercise of any
right, remedy, power or privilege.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
(x) the Company and the Attractions Purchaser shall share equally all
reasonable Expenses related to the printing, filing and distribution of the
Proxy Statement, if any, other than attorneys and accountants fees, (y) the
Ski Purchaser shall pay all filing fees associated with any filings with
antitrust authorities, and (z) the Attractions Purchaser shall pay all out-of-

Section 11.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions._

 

The Parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting
of this Agreement. Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any provision of this Agreement. References to "this Agreement" shall include
the Seller Disclosure Letter. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article, Section, Appendix or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article
or Section of, or an Appendix or Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings for this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are

 



129  used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms
defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other instrument made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any
Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to herein means such Law as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor Laws. References to a Person are also to its successors and
permitted assigns. All references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the
United States of America.

 

Section 11.4 _Severability_.

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced under any present or future Law, or public policy,
(a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable, (b) this Agreement
shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never comprised a part hereof, and (c) all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable term or other
provision or by its severance herefrom so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Sale or the other Contemplated Transactions is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely
as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Sale and the
other Contemplated Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 11.5 _Assignment_.

Neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or obligations hereunder
shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by any of the Parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that each
Purchasers rights and obligations under this Agreement may be assigned and
delegated in whole or in part, and without the consent of Sellers, to one or
more Subsidiaries or Affiliates of any Purchaser; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that no such assignment shall relieve any Purchaser of its obligations
hereunder. Any attempt to make any such assignment without a consent required
by the preceding sentence (if any) shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentences, but without relieving any Party of any obligation
hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors or assigns. For
the avoidance of doubt, any assignee of rights or delegate of obligations
permitted by this _Section 11.5_ shall be a permitted assign for purposes of
this Agreement.

 



130 Section 11.6 _Entire Agreement_.

 

This Agreement (including the exhibits, annexes and appendices hereto and the
Seller Disclosure Letter) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality
Agreements, the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Notwithstanding the prior
sentence, solely as between the Attractions Purchaser and the Ski Purchaser,
this Agreement (including the exhibits, annexes and appendices hereto and the
Seller Disclosure Letter) and the Joint Buyers Agreement constitute the
entire agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
between the Attractions Purchaser and the Ski Purchaser with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.

Section 11.7 _Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 

This Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer any rights or remedies
upon any Person other than the Parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

Section 11.8 _Miscellaneous_.

 

The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
Parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the Parties hereto in accordance with _Section 10.5_
without notice or liability to any other Person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the Parties hereto. Accordingly, Persons other than the Parties
hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the Effective Date
or as of any other date.

 

Section 11.9 _Remedies; Protection of Trustee_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the Seller
Parties does not perform any of the provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with its specific terms or otherwise breaches such provisions, and
that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article 10_ , each of the Purchasers shall be entitled
to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at Law or in equity. Each of the Seller Parties agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
on the basis that each of the Purchasers has an adequate remedy at Law or
that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at Law or in equity. Each Purchaser seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
The Parties hereto agree that none of the Seller Parties shall be entitled to
an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent

 



131  and/or remedy a breach of this Agreement by the Purchasers or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof and that the Seller Parties sole
and exclusive remedy relating to a breach of this Agreement by the Purchasers
or otherwise shall be the remedy set forth in _Section 10.3(a)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to
prevent any breach by any Purchaser of  _Section 8.5(b)_.

(b) The Parties further agree (i) the seeking of remedies pursuant to _Section
11.9(a)_ shall not in any respect constitute a waiver by any Purchaser
seeking such remedies of its respective right to seek any other form of relief
that may be available to it under this Agreement, including under _Section
10.3_, in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event
that the remedies provided for in _Section 11.9(a)_ are not available or
otherwise not granted and (ii) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall
require any Purchaser to institute any proceeding for (or limit any of such
Purchasers right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under
this _Section 11.9_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination
right under _Article 10_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor
shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding by any Purchaser seeking
remedies pursuant to _Section 11.9(a)_ or anything set forth in this _Section
11.9_ restrict or limit such Purchasers right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of _Article 10_ or pursue any other remedies under
this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
_Section 10.2_), the maximum aggregate liability of the Purchasers and their
permitted assigns together for any losses, damages, costs or expenses of the
Seller Parties or their Affiliates relating to the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, or a breach of
this Agreement by any Purchaser or its permitted assigns or otherwise, shall
be limited to an amount equal to (i) the amount of the Purchaser Termination
Amount, plus (ii) the aggregate amount of Reimbursable Expenses payable
pursuant to  _Section 10.3(a)(v)_ (collectively, the " _Liability
Limitation_ "), and in no event shall the Seller Parties or any of their
Affiliates seek any amount in excess of the Liability Limitation in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of
any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise.

(d) Notwithstanding anything express or implied in this Agreement to the
contrary, the maximum liability of the Jersey Trustee under this Agreement
(including any liability for interest, costs, expenses and/or any other sums
recoverable under this Agreement) shall not exceed the value of the property
held in the Jersey Trust from time to time and which is in the Jersey
Trustees possession or under its control as trustee of the Jersey Trust;
provided that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any breach of trust
by, or fraudulent or criminal acts of, the Jersey Trustee.

 

(e) Each of the Purchasers, jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates (the Company and each such
Person being an " _Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, liabilities and expenses that may be incurred by or asserted
or awarded against any Indemnified Party as a result of, or in
connection with, or arising from owning the Note and will reimburse any
Indemnified Party for all reasonable and documented expenses (including
counsel fees and

 



132  expenses) in connection with the investigation of, preparation for or
defense of any pending or threatened claim or any action or proceeding arising
therefrom, whether or not such Indemnified Party is a party and whether or
not such claim, action or proceeding is initiated or brought by or on behalf
of the Company or any of its Affiliates. Any Indemnified Party entitled to
indemnification under this _Section 11.9(e)_ will, promptly after receipt of
such notice of commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or claim against
it in respect of which a claim for indemnification may be made hereunder,
notify the Purchasers. Failure to so notify the Purchasers shall not relieve
the Purchasers from any other obligation they may have hereunder or otherwise,
unless the Purchasers have been materially prejudiced in their ability to
defend the action as a result of such delay. In case any such action is
brought against any Indemnified Party and it notifies the Purchasers of the
commencement thereof, the Purchasers will be entitled to participate in the
defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the Company. No Purchaser shall
be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written
consent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

Section 11.10  _Counterparts_.

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the
different Parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile transmission
or by e-mail of a pdf attachment shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

Section 11.11  _Governing Law_.

This Agreement and all Legal Proceedings (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the actions of the Purchasers or the Seller Parties in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Maryland, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Laws provision or
rule (whether of the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State
of Maryland.

Section 11.12 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Maryland and to the jurisdiction
of Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) (the " _Maryland Court_ "), for
the purpose of any Legal Proceeding (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the actions of the Parties hereto in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement thereof, and each of the Parties
hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to such Legal
Proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in any Maryland state or
federal court.

(b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees
to request and/or consent to the assignment of any such proceeding to the
Maryland Courts Business and Technology Case Management Program. Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably and

 



133  unconditionally (a) consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Maryland Court for the purpose of any Legal Proceeding brought by any
Party arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any ancillary
agreement, (b) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in
the Maryland Court, (c) agrees that any claim with respect to any such action
or proceeding shall be heard and determined in the Maryland Court, (d)
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to venue of any such action or
proceeding in the Maryland Court, and (e) waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in the Maryland Court. Each of the
Parties agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive, subject to any rights of appeal, and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Nothing in this Agreement shall, however, limit or affect the rights of any
Party to pursue appeals from any judgments or orders of the Maryland Court as
provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 11.2_. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted
by Law.

__Section 11.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_ _._

 

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH
MAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE),
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SALE
OR THE OTHER CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO
IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. EACH
OF THE PARTIES HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE,

THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS

connection herewith which is given or may be given to secure the indebtedness
evidenced hereby shall operate as a waiver of such right, or of any other

occasion be deemed to be a bar to, or waiver of, the same or of any other
right on any future occasion.

During the continuance of any Event of Default, and after the Maturity Date,
or such earlier date on which the entire sum may become due and payable at the
option of the Lender following the occurrence of an Event of Default as set
forth above, this Note shall bear interest, per annum, at the Rate

parties hereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of laws provision or rule (whether by the State of New York or any other

1.2 _Secured Obligations_.

 

(a) Mortgagor makes the grant, conveyance, and mortgage set forth in 
_Section_ _ _ _1.1_ above, and grants the security interest set forth in
_Section_ _ _ _3_ below for the purpose of securing the following obligations
(the " _Secured Obligations_ ") in any order of priority that Mortgagee may
choose:

(i) Payment and performance by the Borrowers of all of their obligations
under the Note, in the manner and with interest all as more fully described in
the Note; and

 



-3- (ii) Payment and performance of all obligations of each of the Borrowers
under each of the Mortgages; and

(iii) Payment and performance of all obligations that Mortgagor or any
successor in ownership of all or part of the Property may agree to pay and/or
perform (whether as principal, surety or guarantor) for the benefit of
Mortgagee, when a writing evidences the parties agreement that the advance
or obligation be secured by this Mortgage; and

(iv) Payment and performance of all modifications, amendments, extensions,
and renewals, however evidenced, of any of the Secured Obligations.

 

(ix) Payment of any and all loan commissions, service charges, liquidated
damages, expenses and advances due to or incurred by Mortgagee as provided
for in _Section_ _ _ _7.13_ of this Mortgage.

 

(b) All Persons who may have or acquire an interest in all or any part of
the Property will be considered to have notice of, and will be bound by, the
terms of the Secured Obligations and each other agreement or instrument made
or entered into in connection with each of the Secured Obligations.

 

2. _Assignment of Rents and Leases_. 

 

2.1 _Assignment_. Mortgagor hereby irrevocably, absolutely, presently and
unconditionally assigns to Mortgagee (i) all rents, royalties, issues,
profits, revenue, income, accounts, proceeds and other benefits of the
Property, whether now due, past due or to become due, including all prepaid
rents and security deposits (some or all collectively, as the context may
require, " _Rents_ ") and (ii) all of Mortgagors rights in and under all
Leases. This is an absolute assignment, not an assignment for security only.
Such assignment shall not be construed to bind Mortgagee to the performance
of any of the covenants or provisions contained in any Lease or otherwise
impose any obligation upon Mortgagee.

 

2.2 _Grant of License_. Mortgagee hereby confers upon Mortgagor a license
(" _License_ ") to collect and retain the Rents as they become due and
payable, so long as no Event of Default, as defined in _Section_ _ _ _6.2_
below, shall exist and be continuing. If an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, Mortgagee shall have the right, which it may choose to
exercise in its sole discretion, to terminate this License without notice to
or demand upon Mortgagor, and without regard to the adequacy of Mortgagees
security under this Mortgage.

 

2.3 _Collection and Application of Rents_. Subject to the License granted
to Mortgagor under  _Section_ _ _ _2.2_ above, Mortgagee has the right, power
and authority to collect any and all Rents. Mortgagor hereby appoints
Mortgagee its attorney-in-fact to perform any and all of the following acts,
if and at the times when Mortgagee in its sole discretion may so choose:

 

(a) Demand, receive and enforce payment of any and all Rents; or

 

(b) Give receipts, releases and satisfactions for any and all Rents; or

 



-4- (c) Sue either in the name of Mortgagor or in the name of Mortgagee for
any and all Rents.

Mortgagee and Mortgagor agree that the mere recordation of the assignment
granted herein entitles Mortgagee immediately to collect and receive rents
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, as defined in _Section_ _ _ _6.2_
, without first taking any acts of enforcement under applicable law, such as,
but not limited to, providing notice to Mortgagor, filing foreclosure
proceedings, or seeking and/or obtaining the appointment of a receiver.
Further, Mortgagees right to the Rents does not depend on whether or not
Mortgagee takes possession of the Property as permitted under  _Subsection
6.3(c)_. In Mortgagees sole discretion, Mortgagee may choose to collect Rents
either with or without taking possession of the Property. Mortgagee shall
apply all Rents collected by it in the manner provided under  _Section_ _ _
_6.6_. If an Event of Default occurs while Mortgagee is in possession of all
or part of the Property and is collecting and applying Rents as permitted
under this Mortgage, Mortgagee and any receiver shall nevertheless be
entitled to exercise and invoke every right and remedy afforded any of them
under this Mortgage and at law or in equity.

 

2.4 _Mortgagee Not Responsible_. Under no circumstances shall Mortgagee
have any duty to produce Rents from the Property. Regardless of whether or
not Mortgagee, in person or by agent, takes actual possession of the Premises
and Improvements, unless Mortgagee agrees in writing to the contrary,
Mortgagee is not and shall not be deemed to be:

 

(a) A "mortgagee in possession" for any purpose; or

 

(b) Responsible for performing any of the obligations of the lessor or
lessee under any lease; or

 

(c) Responsible for any waste committed by lessees or any other parties,
any dangerous or defective condition of the Property, or any negligence in
the management, upkeep, repair or control of the Property; or

 

(d) Liable in any manner for the Property or the use, occupancy, enjoyment
or operation of all or any part of it.

2.5 _Reserved_.

 

3. _Grant of Security Interest_. 

 

3.1 _Security Agreement_. The parties intend for this Mortgage to create a
lien on the Property, and an absolute assignment of the Rents and Leases, all
in favor of Mortgagee. The parties acknowledge that some of the Property and
some or all of the Rents may be determined under applicable law to be personal
property or fixtures. To the extent that any Property or Rents may be or be
determined to be personal property, Mortgagor as debtor hereby grants
Mortgagee as secured party a security interest in all such Property and Rents,
to secure payment and performance of the Secured Obligations. Also, included
in the definition of Property for purposes of this security agreement are all
Mortgagors personal property located on or used in connection with the leased
premises and Mortgagors interests in the Leases. This security interest
includes all personal property and rights of Mortgagor in personal property
that is intended to be

 



-5-  incorporated into the Property, regardless of where such personal property
is located. This Mortgage constitutes a security agreement under the Uniform
Commercial Code of the [insert state of situs of Property], covering all such
Property and Rents.

3.2 _Financing Statements_. Mortgagor shall authorize the filing or
recording of one or more financing statements and such other documents as
Mortgagee may from time to time require to perfect or continue the perfection
of Mortgagees security interest in any Property or Rents. As provided in
_Section_ _ _ _5.9_ below, Mortgagor shall pay all fees and costs that
Mortgagee may incur in filing such documents in public offices and in
obtaining such record searches as Mortgagee may reasonably require. In case
Mortgagor fails to authorize any financing statements or other documents for
the perfection or continuation of any security interest, Mortgagor hereby
appoints Mortgagee as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact to authorize any
such documents on its behalf. If any financing statement or other document is
filed in the records normally pertaining to personal property, that filing
shall never be construed as in any way derogating from or impairing this
Mortgage or the rights or obligations of the parties under it.

 

4. _Fixture Filing_. 

 

This Mortgage constitutes a financing statement filed as a fixture filing
under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in the [insert state of situs
of Property], as amended or recodified from time to time, covering any
Property which now is or later may become fixtures attached to the Premises or
Improvements. Also included as fixtures, to the extent same are deemed
fixtures, for the purpose of this fixture filing are leasehold improvements,
and located on the property more particularly described on _Schedule A_. For
this purpose, the respective addresses of Mortgagor, as debtor, and Mortgagee,
as secured party, are as set forth in the preambles of this Mortgage.

5. _Rights and Duties of the Parties_. 

 

5.1 _Representations and Warranties_. "to Mortgagors knowledge," and
words or phrases of similar import shall not include knowledge of Mortgagor,
direct or indirect owners of Mortgagor, or officers of Mortgagor existing
prior to the date hereof and the knowledge of such Persons shall not be
imputed to the Mortgagor. Mortgagor represents and warrants that, to

permitted liens;

 

(f) Other than permitted liens, Mortgagor owns any Property which is

(h) Mortgagor is an entity as described above, organized and in good
standing in the jurisdiction first set forth above, and Mortgagors place of

5.5 _Continuing Use Restrictions_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Mortgage to the contrary, Mortgagor shall not have the right to use the
Premises, or any part thereof, for any use or purpose which is not permitted
by, or which results in violation of any agreement, covenant or restriction to
which the Premises is subject as of the date of this Mortgage. Subject to the
terms of any applicable Lease, the Premises shall not be used for any use
inconsistent with the customary character of a destination ski resort. [NTD-

Mortgagor agrees not to permit any unlawful or immoral practice to be carried
on at or committed in the Premises, or a use which would injure the reputation
of the Premises, or the local community.

5.6 _Prohibition of Use_. If at any time, (i) any Law prohibits the use of

Mortgage (the " _Prohibition_ "), then immediately

 



-7-  upon the earlier to occur of (a) Mortgagor becoming aware of any proposed
Prohibition, or (b) Mortgagors receipt of any notice from any governmental
authority of any Prohibition, Mortgagor shall promptly notify Mortgagee of
such fact, and Mortgagor may proceed in its or Mortgagees name, and at
Mortgagors sole cost and expense, to take such action as Mortgagee determines
is necessary or desirable to contest or challenge the Prohibition. If a
Prohibition should occur or be imposed, nothing in this Mortgage shall be
deemed to impair Mortgagors obligations to comply with all Laws and this

the Premises for the purposes permitted in this Mortgage.

a title insurance endorsement acceptable to Mortgagee that provides coverage
for such lien.

 

5.9 _Damages and Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds_.

 

(a) _Casualty_. Subject to the terms of any applicable Lease, in the event
of any casualty, Mortgagor shall promptly notify Mortgagee of any loss to the
Premises, Improvements or the Property in excess of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND
DOLLARS ($100,000), whether covered by insurance or not. Subject to the terms
of any applicable Lease, in case of loss or damage by fire or other casualty
to the Premises, Improvements, or Property, Mortgagee agrees, if no Event of
Default exists, that such insurance proceeds may be applied to the costs of
reconstruction or repair of the Premises, Improvements, or Property to the
extent required under the terms of any operating lease. Any such
reconstruction or repair must be of least equal value and of substantially the
same character as prior to such damage or destruction. Upon completion of
such reconstruction or repair permitted under this _Section_ _ _ _5.9_ ,
Mortgagee shall apply any excess proceeds in its possession to the payment of
the Secured Obligations to the extent permitted by the applicable operating
lease.

(b) _Condemnation_. Subject to the terms of any applicable Lease, in
the event of condemnation, Mortgagor hereby assigns, transfers and sets over

award and any claim for damages for any of the Improvements, the Premises, or
the Property taken or damaged under the power of eminent domain or by
condemnation or by sale in lieu thereof. After

 



-8-  deducting therefrom all reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees
Mortgagee may, at its option, elect to apply the proceeds of the award upon or
in reduction of the indebtedness secured hereby, whether due or not, or hold
said proceeds in any account and make said proceeds available for restoration
or rebuilding of the Improvements or Premises, or the repair and replacement
of Property, all at Mortgagees discretion, and such proceeds shall be made
available in such manner and under such conditions as Mortgagee may require.

 

5.10 _Maintenance and Preservation of Property_.

 

(a) To the extent not already required by any applicable Lease, Mortgagor
shall keep the Premises, the Improvements and the Property insured against
loss by fire and such other casualties and contingencies as reasonably
required by Mortgagee.

 

(b) Mortgagor shall, or shall enforce the provisions of any applicable
Lease requiring the applicable tenant to, keep the Improvements, the Premises
and the Property in good condition. During the continuance of an Event of
Default Mortgagor shall not remove or demolish the Property or any part of it,

orders, common law rules, statutes, acts, laws, codes, ordinances, permits,
licenses, rules or regulations and sound building practices regardless of

costs of work of repair or reconstruction, unless Mortgagor determines in its
reasonable business discretion that it is not prudent to continue with such
work or repair.

 

(d) Mortgagor shall not commit or, subject to the terms of any applicable
Lease, allow any act upon or use of the Property which would violate: (i) any

to be enacted and whether foreseen or unforeseen; or (ii) any public or
private covenant, condition, restriction or equitable servitude affecting the
Property. Mortgagor shall use diligent efforts to not bring or keep any
article on the Property or cause or allow any condition to exist on it, if

required to be maintained by Mortgagor on the Property or any part of it.

 

(e) Mortgagor shall not commit or, subject to any applicable Lease, allow
waste of the Property.

 

(f) Subject to the terms of any applicable Lease, Mortgagor shall not

portion thereof) without the express prior written consent of Mortgagee.

amounts due and owing under any Lease.

all notes and instruments evidencing the Secured Obligations. Mortgagor shall
pay any costs of preparation and recordation of such release.

 

5.13 _Compensation, Exculpation_.

 

(a) If Mortgagee chooses to dispose of Property through more than one
Foreclosure Sale, Mortgagor shall pay all costs, expenses or other advances
that may be incurred or made Mortgagee in each of such Foreclosure Sales.

 



-10- (b) Mortgagee shall not be directly or indirectly liable to Mortgagor or
any other person as a consequence of any of the following (except to the
extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Mortgagee):

 

(i) The exercise of or failure by Mortgagee to exercise any rights,
remedies or powers granted to Mortgagee in this Mortgage;

(ii) Mortgagees failure or refusal to perform or discharge any obligation
or liability of Mortgagor under any agreement related to the Property or under
this Mortgage; or

 

(iii) Any loss sustained by Mortgagor or any third party resulting from any
failure by Mortgagee to lease the Property, or from any other act or omission
of Mortgagee in managing the Property, after an Event of Default, unless the
loss is caused by the willful misconduct and bad faith of Mortgagee.

 

Mortgagor hereby expressly waives and releases all liability of the types
described above, and agrees that no such liability shall be asserted against
or imposed upon Mortgagee.

5.14 _Defense and Notice of Claims and Actions_. At Mortgagors sole
expense, Mortgagor shall protect, preserve and defend the Property and title
to and right of possession of the Property, and the security of this Mortgage
and the rights and powers of Mortgagee created under it, against all

any claim is asserted which does or could affect any such matters, or if any
action or proceeding is commenced which alleges or relates to any such claim.

 

5.15 _Subrogation_. Mortgagee shall be subrogated to the liens of all
encumbrances, whether released of record or not, which are discharged in
whole or in part by Mortgagee in accordance with this Mortgage or with the
proceeds of any loan secured by this Mortgage.

 

5.16 _Site Visits, Observation and Testing_. Subject to the terms of any
applicable Lease, Mortgagee and its agents and representatives shall have the
right at any reasonable time to enter and visit the Property for the purpose
of performing appraisals, observing the Property, taking and removing soil or

an Event of Default exists that has not been waived in writing by Mortgagee,
Mortgagee shall not have the right without the consent of Mortgagor to visit
the Property for such purposes more than twice in any calendar year.
Mortgagee has no duty, however, to visit or observe the Property or to conduct
tests, and no site visit, observation or testing by Mortgagee, its agents or
representatives shall impose any liability on any of Mortgagee, its agents or
representatives. In no event shall any site visit, observation or testing by
Mortgagee, its agents or representatives be a representation that Hazardous
Material are or are not present in, on or under the Property, or that there
has been or shall be compliance with any law, regulation or ordinance
pertaining to Hazardous Material or any other applicable governmental law.
Neither Mortgagor nor any other party is entitled to rely on any site visit,
observation or testing by any of Mortgagee, its agents or representatives.
Neither Mortgagee, its agents or representatives owe any duty of care to
protect Mortgagor or any other party against, or to inform Mortgagor or any
other party of, any Hazardous Material or any other adverse condition
affecting the Property.

 



-11-  Mortgagee shall give Mortgagor reasonable notice before entering the
Property. Mortgagee shall make reasonable efforts to avoid interfering with
Mortgagors use of the Property in exercising any rights provided in this
_Section_ _ _ _5.16_. For purposes of this _Section_ _ _ _5.16_ , "Hazardous
Material" means any pollutant, contaminant, toxic substance, chemical
substance or mixture, hazardous waste, hazardous material, or hazardous
substance, or any oil, petroleum, or petroleum product, as defined in or
pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as

than one place of business.

 

6. _Default and Remedies_. 

 

6.1 Intentionally Omitted.

 

6.2 _Events of Default_. This Mortgage is upon the [STATUTORY CONDITIONS,
for any breach of which the Mortgagee shall have the STATUTORY POWER OF
SALE]3. Mortgagor will be in default under this Mortgage upon the occurrence
of any one or more of the following events (some or all collectively, "
_Events of Default_ ;" any one singly, an " _Event of Default_ ").

(a) Failure of any of the Borrowers (i) (x) to pay any of the principal,
fee or interest of the Secured Obligations when due or (y) to observe or
perform any of the other covenants or conditions by any of the Borrowers to be
performed under the terms of the Mortgages concerning the payment of money
for a period of five (5) days after written notice from Mortgagee that the
same is due and payable; or (ii) for a period of thirty (30) days after
written notice from Mortgagee, to observe or perform any non-
monetary covenant or condition contained in the Mortgages; provided that if
any such failure concerning a non-monetary covenant or condition is
susceptible to cure but cannot reasonably be cured within said thirty (30) day
period, then Mortgagor shall have an additional thirty (30) day period to
cure such failure and no Event of Default shall be deemed to exist hereunder
so long as (x) Mortgagor commences such cure within the initial thirty (30)
day period and diligently and in good faith pursues such cure to completion
within such resulting sixty (60) day period from the date of Mortgagees
notice, and (y) the existence of such uncured default will not result in any
tenant under a Lease having the right to terminate such Lease due to
such uncured default.

-12- 6.3 _Remedies_. At any time after an Event of Default, Mortgagee shall be
entitled to invoke any and all of the rights and remedies described below, in
addition to all other rights and remedies available to Mortgagee at law or in
equity. All of such rights and remedies shall be cumulative, and the
exercise of any one or more of them shall not constitute an election of
remedies.

 

(a) _Acceleration_. Mortgagee may declare any or all of the Secured
Obligations to be due and payable immediately.

(b) _Receiver_. Mortgagee shall, as a matter of right, without notice and
without giving bond to Mortgagor or anyone claiming by, under or through
Mortgagor, and without regard for the solvency or insolvency of Mortgagor or
the then value of the Property, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be
entitled to have a receiver appointed for all or any part of the Property and
the Rents, and the proceeds, issues and profits thereof, with the rights and
powers referenced below and such other rights and powers as the court making
such appointment shall confer, and Mortgagor hereby consents to the
appointment of such receiver and shall not oppose any such appointment. Such
receiver shall have all powers and duties prescribed by applicable law, all
other powers which are necessary or usual in such cases for the protection,
possession, control, management and operation of the Property, and such rights
and powers as Mortgagee would have, upon entering and taking possession of the
Property under subsection (c) below.

 

(c) _Entry_. Mortgagee, in person, by agent or by court-appointed
receiver, may enter, take possession of, manage and operate all or any part
of the Property (which may be subject to the provisions of applicable Leases),
and may also do any and all other things in connection with those actions that
Mortgagee may in its sole discretion consider necessary and appropriate to
protect the security of this Mortgage. Such other things may include: taking
and possessing all of Mortgagors or the then owners Books and Records;
entering into, enforcing, modifying or canceling leases on such terms and
conditions as Mortgagee may consider proper; obtaining and evicting tenants;
fixing or modifying Rents; collecting and receiving any payment of money owing
to Mortgagee; completing any unfinished construction; and/or contracting for
and making repairs and alterations. If Mortgagee so requests, Mortgagor shall
assemble all of the Property that is still owned by Mortgagor and has been
removed from the Premises and make all of it available to Mortgagee at the
site of the Premises. Mortgagor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints
Mortgagee as Mortgagors attorney-in-fact to perform such acts and execute
such documents as Mortgagee in its sole discretion may consider to be
appropriate in connection with taking these measures, including endorsement
of Mortgagors name on any instruments.

 

(d) _Cure; Protection of Security_. Mortgagee may cure any breach or
default of Mortgagor, and if it chooses to do so in connection with any such
cure, Mortgagee may also enter the Property and/or do any and all other things
which it may in its sole

 



-13-  discretion consider necessary and appropriate to protect the security of
this Mortgage. Such other things may include: appearing in and/or defending
any action or proceeding which purports to affect the security of, or the
rights or powers of Mortgagee under, this Mortgage; paying, purchasing,
contesting or compromising any encumbrance, charge, lien, claim of lien or
imposition which in Mortgagees sole judgment is or may be senior in priority
to this Mortgage, such judgment of Mortgagee or to be conclusive as among the
parties to this Mortgage; obtaining insurance and/or paying any premiums or
charges for insurance; otherwise caring for and protecting any and all of the
Property; and/or employing counsel, accountants, contractors and other
appropriate persons to assist Mortgagee. Mortgagee may take any of the actions
permitted under this _Subsection 6.3(d)_ either with or without giving notice
to any person. Any reasonable amounts expended by Mortgagee under this
_Subsection 6.3(d)_ shall be secured by this Mortgage.

 

(e) _Uniform Commercial Code Remedies_. Mortgagee may exercise any or all
of the remedies granted to a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code
in the State in which the Property is located.

 

(f) _Foreclosure; Lawsuits_. Mortgagee shall have the right, in one or
several concurrent or consecutive proceedings, to foreclose the lien hereof
upon the Property or any part thereof, for the Secured Obligations, or any
part thereof, by any proceedings appropriate under applicable law. Mortgagee
or its nominee may bid and become the purchaser of all or any part of the
Property at any foreclosure or other sale hereunder, and the amount of
Mortgagees successful bid shall be credited on the Secured Obligations.
Without limiting the foregoing, Mortgagee may proceed by a suit or suits in
law or equity, whether for specific performance of any covenant or agreement
herein contained or in aid of the execution of any power herein granted, or
for any foreclosure under the judgment or decree of any court of
competent jurisdiction.

(g) _Other Remedies_. Mortgagee may exercise all rights and
remedies contained in any other instrument, document, agreement or other
writing heretofore, concurrently or in the future executed by Mortgagor or any
other person or entity in favor of Mortgagee in connection with the Secured
Obligations or any part thereof, without prejudice to the right of Mortgagee
thereafter to enforce any appropriate remedy against Mortgagor. Mortgagee
shall have the right to pursue all remedies afforded to a mortgagee under
applicable law, and shall have the benefit of all of the provisions of such
applicable law, including all amendments thereto which may become effective
from time to time after the date hereof.

 

(h) _Sale of Personal Property_. Mortgagee shall have the discretionary
right to cause some or all of the Property, which constitutes personal
property, to be sold or otherwise disposed of in any combination in accordance
with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in the state in which the
Property is situated or in any other manner permitted by applicable law.

(i) For purposes of this power of sale, Mortgagee may elect to treat as
personal property any Property which is intangible or which can be severed
from the Premises or Improvements without causing structural damage. If it
chooses to

 



-14-  do so, Mortgagee may dispose of any personal property, in any manner
permitted by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code of the State in which
the Property is located, including any public or private sale, or in any
manner permitted by any other applicable law.

(ii) In connection with any sale or other disposition of such Property,
Mortgagor agrees compliance with the Uniform Commercial Code, as the same may
be amended from time to time, shall constitute a commercially reasonable sale:
Mortgagee shall mail written notice of the sale to Mortgagor not later than
thirty (30) days prior to such sale. Mortgagee will publish notice of the sale
in a local daily newspaper of general circulation. Upon receipt of any written
request, Mortgagor will make the Property available to any bona fide
prospective purchaser for inspection during reasonable business hours.
Notwithstanding, Mortgagee shall be under no obligation to consummate a sale
if, in its judgment, none of the offers received by it equals the fair value
of the Property offered for sale. The foregoing procedures do not constitute
the only procedures that may be commercially reasonable, and

 

(iii) _Single or Multiple Foreclosure Sales_. If the Property consists of
more than one lot, parcel or item of property, Mortgagee may:

(iv) Designate the order in which the lots, parcels and/or items shall be
sold or disposed of or offered for sale or disposition; and

(v) Elect to dispose of the lots, parcels and/or items through a single
consolidated sale or disposition to be held or made under or in connection
with judicial proceedings, or by virtue of a judgment and decree of
foreclosure and sale; or through two or more such sales or dispositions; or
in any other manner Mortgagee may deem to be in its best interests (any such
sale or disposition, a " _Foreclosure Sale_ ;" and any two or more, "
_Foreclosure Sales_ ").

 

If Mortgagee chooses to have more than one Foreclosure Sale, Mortgagee at its
option may cause the Foreclosure Sales to be held simultaneously or
successively, on the same day, or on such different days and at such different
times and in such order as Mortgagee may deem to be in its best interests. No
Foreclosure Sale shall terminate or affect the liens of this Mortgage on any
part of the Property which has not been sold, until all of the Secured
Obligations have been paid in full.

6.4 _Credit Bids_. At any Foreclosure Sale, any person, including
Mortgagor or Mortgagee, may bid for and acquire the Property or any part of it
to the extent permitted by then applicable law. Instead of paying cash for
such property, Mortgagee may settle for the purchase price by crediting the
sales price of the property against the following obligations:

 

(a) First, the portion of the Secured Obligations attributable to the
expenses of sale, costs of any action and any other sums for which Mortgagor
is obligated to pay or reimburse Mortgagee under _Section_ _ _ _5.13_ of this
Mortgage; and

 



-15- (b) Second, all other Secured Obligations in any order and proportions as
Mortgagee in its sole discretion may choose.

6.5 _Application of Foreclosure Sale Proceeds_. Mortgagee shall apply the
proceeds of any Foreclosure Sale in the following manner:

 

(a) First, to pay the portion of the Secured Obligations attributable to
the expenses of sale, costs of any action and any other sums for which
Mortgagor is obligated to reimburse Mortgagee under _Section_ _ _ _5.13_ of
this Mortgage;

 

(b) Second, to pay the portion of the Secured Obligations attributable to
any sums expended or advanced by Mortgagee under the terms of this Mortgage
which then remain unpaid;

(c) Third, to pay all other Secured Obligations in any order and
proportions as Mortgagee in its sole discretion may choose; and

 

(d) Fourth, to remit the remainder, if any, to the person or persons
entitled to it or to pay such funds into a court having jurisdiction over
such funds.

6.6 _Application of Rents and Other Sums_. Upon the occurrence of and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, Mortgagee shall apply any and
all Rents collected by it, and any and all sums other than proceeds of a
Foreclosure Sale which Mortgagee may receive or collect under  _Section_ _ _
_6.3_ above, in the following manner:

(a) First, to pay the portion of the Secured Obligations attributable to
the costs and expenses of operation and collection that may be incurred by
Mortgagee or any receiver;

 

(b) Second, to pay all other Secured Obligations in any order and
proportions as Mortgagee in its sole discretion may choose; and

(c) Third, to remit the remainder, if any, to the person or
persons entitled to it or to pay such funds into a court having jurisdiction
over such funds.

Mortgagee shall have no liability for any funds which it does not actually
receive.

7. _Miscellaneous Provisions_. 

 

7.1 _No Waiver or Cure_.

 

(a) Each waiver by Mortgagee must be in writing, and no waiver shall be
construed as a continuing waiver. No waiver shall be implied from any delay
or failure by Mortgagee to take action on account of any default of Mortgagor.
Consent by Mortgagee to any act or omission by Mortgagor shall not be
construed as a consent to any other or subsequent act or omission or to waive
the requirement for Mortgagees consent to be obtained in any future or other
instance.

 



-16- (b) If any of the events described below occurs, that event alone shall
not: cure or waive any breach, Event of Default or notice of default under
this Mortgage or invalidate any act performed pursuant to any such default or
notice; or nullify the effect of any notice of default or sale (unless all
Secured Obligations then due have been paid and performed and all other
defaults have been cured); or impair the security of this Mortgage; or
prejudice Mortgagee or any receiver in the exercise of any right or remedy
afforded any of them under this Mortgage; or be construed as an affirmation
by Mortgagee of any tenancy, lease or option, or a subordination of the lien
of this Mortgage.

 

(i) Mortgagee, its agent or a receiver takes possession of all or any part
of the Property in the manner provided in _Subsection 6.3(c)_.

(ii) Mortgagee collects and applies Rents as permitted under  _Sections_ _
_ _2.3_ and _6.6_ above, either with or without taking possession of all or
any part of the Property.

 

(iii) Mortgagee receives and applies to any Secured Obligation any proceeds
of any Property, including any proceeds of insurance policies, condemnation
awards, or other claims, property or rights assigned to Mortgagee under
_Section_ _ _ _5.9_ above.

 

(iv) Mortgagee makes a site visit, observes the Property and/or conducts
tests as permitted under  _Section_ _ _ _5.16_ above.

(v) Mortgagee receives any sums under this Mortgage or any proceeds of any
collateral held for any of the Secured Obligations, and applies them to one or
more Secured Obligations.

 

(vi) Mortgagee or any receiver invokes any right or remedy provided under
this Mortgage.

 

7.2 _Powers of Mortgagee_.

 

(a) If Mortgagee performs any act which it is empowered or authorized to
perform under this Mortgage, including any act permitted by _Section_ _ _
_5.13_ or _Subsection_ _6.3(d)_ of this Mortgage, that act alone shall not
release or change the personal liability of any Person for the payment and
performance of the Secured Obligations then outstanding, or the lien of this
Mortgage on all or the remainder of the Property for full payment and
performance of all outstanding Secured Obligations. The liability of the
original Mortgagor shall not be released or changed if Mortgagee grants any
successor in interest to Mortgagor any extension of time for payment, or
modification of the terms of payment, of any Secured Obligation. Mortgagee
shall not be required to comply with any demand by the original Mortgagor
that Mortgagee refuse to grant such an extension or modification to, or
commence proceedings against, any such successor in interest.

 

(b) Mortgagee may take any of the actions permitted under _Subsections_ _ _
_6.3(b)_  and/or _6.3(c)_ regardless of the adequacy of the security for the
Secured Obligations, or

 



-17-  whether any or all of the Secured Obligations have been declared to be
immediately due and payable, or whether notice of default and election to sell
has been given under this Mortgage.

 

(c) From time to time, Mortgagee may apply to any court of competent
jurisdiction for aid and direction in executing and enforcing the rights and
remedies created under this Mortgage. Mortgagee may from time to time obtain
orders or decrees directing, confirming or approving acts in executing and
enforcing these rights and remedies.

 

7.3 _Merger_. No merger shall occur as a result of Mortgagees acquiring
any other estate in or any other lien on the Property unless Mortgagee
consents to a merger in writing.

7.4 _Joint and Several Liability_. If Mortgagor consists of more than one
Person, each shall be jointly and severally liable for the faithful
performance of all of Mortgagors obligations under this Mortgage.

 

7.5 _Applicable Law_. The creation, perfection and enforcement of the lien
of this Mortgage shall be governed by the law of the [State of location of
Property] without reference to the principles of conflicts of laws. Subject to
the foregoing, in all other respects, this Mortgage shall be governed by the
substantive laws of the State of New York without reference to the principles
of conflicts of laws that would require the application of the laws of another
jurisdiction. Wherever possible, each provision of this Mortgage shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provisions of this Mortgage shall conflict with, be prohibited by
or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Mortgage. In the event
that any provision or clause of this Mortgage conflicts with applicable law,
such conflict shall not affect other provisions which can be given effect
without the conflicting provision, and to this end, the provisions of this
Mortgage are declared to be severable.

7.6 _ Successors in Interest_. The terms, covenants and conditions of
this Mortgage shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs,
successors and assigns of the parties. However, this _Section_ _ _ _7.6_
does not waive the provisions of _Section_ _ _ _6.1_ above.

7.7 _Interpretation_.

 

(a) Whenever the context requires, all words used in the singular will be
construed to have been used in the plural, and vice versa, and each gender
will include any other gender. The captions of the sections of this Mortgage
are for convenience only and do not define or limit any terms or provisions.
The word "include(s)" means "include(s), without limitation," and the word
"including" means "including, but not limited to."

 

(b) The word "obligations" is used in its broadest and most comprehensive
sense, and includes all primary, secondary, direct, indirect, fixed and
contingent obligations. It further includes all principal, interest,
prepayment charges, late charges, loan fees and any other fees and charges
accruing or assessed at any time, as well as all obligations to perform acts
or satisfy conditions.

 



-18- (c) No listing of specific instances, items or matters in any way limits
the scope or generality of any language of this Mortgage. The Exhibits to this
Mortgage are hereby incorporated in this Mortgage.

 

7.8 _Documentary Stamps and Other Taxes_. In addition to (and without
limiting the generality of) the foregoing, Mortgagor hereby agrees to defend,
indemnify, and hold Mortgagee harmless from and against any and all liability
for transfer taxes, documentary stamp taxes and intangible taxes (together
with all interest, penalties, costs, and attorneys fees incurred in
connection therewith) that at any time may be levied, assessed, or imposed by
the State of or any other governmental entity or agency
upon the transfer of title to the real property encumbered hereby, this
Mortgage, the Note or any of the other Loan Documents evidencing or securing
the loan which is the subject of the Note, or any amendment, extension, or
renewal of any of the foregoing, or upon Mortgagee by virtue of owning or
holding any of the foregoing instruments or documents, all of which shall be
secured by the lien and security interest of the loan documents (as from time
to time amended). Whenever attorneys fees are provided to be paid, the term
shall include any and all attorneys fees, attorneys accountant fees,
paralegals and law clerks (and similar persons) fees, including but not
limited to, fees at the pretrial, trial and appellate levels, and in
collection proceedings, incurred or paid by Mortgagee in protecting its
interest in the collateral and enforcing its rights hereunder based on the
actual market hourly rates for the persons providing services to Mortgagee.
The provisions of this Section shall survive the repayment of the indebtedness
secured hereby and the satisfaction of this Mortgage and the other Loan
Documents for so long as any claim may be asserted by the State of
or any such other governmental entity or agency.

 

7.9 _Waiver of Statutory Rights_. To the extent permitted by law,
Mortgagor hereby agrees that it shall not and will not apply for or avail
itself of any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension or exemption laws, or
any so-called "Moratorium Laws," now existing or hereafter enacted, in order
to prevent or hinder the enforcement or foreclosure of this Mortgage, but
hereby waives the benefit of such laws, to the extent waivable. Mortgagor for
itself and all who may claim through or under it waives any and all right to
have the property and estates comprising the Property marshaled upon any
foreclosure of the lien hereof and agrees that any court having jurisdiction
to foreclose such lien may order the Property sold as an entirety. Mortgagor
hereby waives any and all rights of redemption from sale under any judgment
of foreclosure of this Mortgage on behalf of Mortgagor and on behalf of each
and every person acquiring any interest in or title to the Property of any
nature whatsoever, subsequent to the date of this Mortgage. The foregoing
waiver of right of redemption is made pursuant to, and to the extent
permitted, the provisions of applicable law.

 

7.10 _Severability_. If any provision of this Mortgage should be held
unenforceable or void, that provision shall be deemed severable from the
remaining provisions and shall in no way affect the validity of this Mortgage
except that if such provision relates to the payment of any monetary sum, then
Mortgagee may, at its option, declare all Secured Obligations immediately due
and payable.

 



-19- 7.11 _Notices_. Any notice or demand which is made hereunder shall
be delivered by (a) certified mail, return receipt requested, (b) hand

ENTITYS CERTIFICATE OF NON-FOREIGN STATUS

 

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that a transferee of a U.S.
real property interest must withhold tax if the transferor is a
foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes (including section 1445), the owner of
a disregarded entity (which has legal title to a U.S. real property interest
under local law) will be the transferor of the property and not the
disregarded entity. To inform the transferee that withholding of tax is not
required upon the disposition of a U.S. real property interest by [name of
transferor / the disregarded entity of [insert name of regarded Seller]
("Transferor"), the undersigned hereby certifies the following on behalf of
Transferor:



   1. | Transferor is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership,
foreign trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Internal
Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations); 
---|--- 
 



   2. | Transferor is not a disregarded entity as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii); 
---|--- 
 



   3. | Transferors U.S. employer identification number is _
_; and 
---|--- 
 



   4. | Transferors office address is 450 South Orange Avenue, Orlando,
FL, 32801. 
---|--- 

Transferor understands that this certification may be disclosed to the
Internal Revenue Service by the transferee and that any false statement
contained herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.

 

Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this certification
and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct and complete,
and I further declare that I have the authority to sign this document on
behalf of Transferor and am a [responsible officer / general manager / trustee
/ executor][CHOOSE APPLICABLE] within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(i).

WHEREAS, each Purchaser and each of the Seller Parties are parties to that
certain Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of [●], 2016 (as may be
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Purchase
Agreement_ "), pursuant to which each Purchaser is acquiring certain assets of

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises set forth herein and in the
Purchase Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

1\. _Representations and Warranties of the Seller Parties_. Each Seller Party
hereby jointly and severally represents and warrants to each Purchaser as
follows:

 

1.1 _Authority_. Each Seller Party is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization or
incorporation, as the case may be. Each Seller Party has the requisite power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and perform its
obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
each Seller Party and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
by each Purchaser and the Seller Parties, constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of each Seller Party enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, except to the extent that such enforceability may be subject to, and
limited by, applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
receivership or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights generally and general equitable principles. 1.2 _No Conflict_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Seller
Parties and the performance of this Agreement will not (a) conflict with or
violate any provision of the organizational documents of any Seller Party, (b)
violate in any material respect any law or order to which any Seller Party is
subject or by which such Seller Partys properties or assets are bound, (c)
require any Seller Party to obtain any material consent or approval from, or
give any notice to, or make any material filing with, any governmental
authority on or prior to the Closing, (d) result in a material violation or
breach of, constitute a material default, conflict with (with or without due
notice or lapse of time or both), give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration under, result in a material loss of benefit
under, accelerate or create any material obligation under, or require the
consent of any third party to, any material contract to which any Seller Party
is party or by which its properties or assets are bound or (v) result in the
imposition or creation of any material lien upon or with respect to any of the
assets or properties of or by which its properties or assets are bound.

 

1.3 _No Litigation_. There is no action, or to the knowledge of the Company,
litigation or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened in writing against any Seller Party seeking to enjoin, challenge or
prevent the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

2\. _General Release of Claims_. Effective as of the Closing, each Seller
Party acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and each of its agents,
trustees, beneficiaries, directors, officers, affiliates, Subsidiaries,
estates, successors, assigns, members and partners (each a " _Releasor_ ")
that:

 

2.1 Each Releasor, jointly and severally, hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally releases each Purchaser, its permitted assigns,
their respective Subsidiaries, the Target Companies, or any of their
respective employees, directors, partners, trustees, managers, stockholders,
officers, agents, attorneys, representatives (collectively, the " _Releasees_
") from any and all costs and expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, Liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, which relate to or arise out of the
operations of a Target Company or an Asset Seller prior to Closing; _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall affect the rights or
obligations of (i) any party hereto under the Purchase Agreement (including
any rights of a Releasor to bring a claim against a Releasee for breach of the
Purchase Agreement), (ii) the obligations of the Target Companies to any
natural person that constitutes a Covered Person (as defined in the Purchase
Agreement) under the indemnification provisions of the Organizational
Documents of the Target Companies (in effect as of the Effective Date) to the
extent required under Section 8.14 of the Purchase Agreement, or (iii)
a Releasors ability to seek recovery from a Target Company (including any
applicable liability insurance carrier) for damages asserted or adjudged in a
Legal Proceeding against such Releasor arising out of, in connection with or
related to the operations of a Target Company or an Asset Seller and for
which such Releasor is liable because of its prior capacity as a director,
officer, partner, manager, stockholder, member, trustee, employee or agent of
any of the Target Companies or any of the Asset Sellers, provided that either
(y) such damages are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a
final non-appealable judgment to be owed by such Releasor to a Third Party or
(z) such damages are payable pursuant to a settlement of such Legal
Proceeding to which the Purchasers have consented, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Release is
intended to affect the Target Companies rights or obligations (including any
Liabilities assumed pursuant to Section 2.5(a) or 2.9(a) of the Purchase
Agreement) with respect to any Person other than a Releasor.

 



2 2.2 _Covenant Not To Sue_. Each Releasor further agrees not to institute any
Legal Proceeding against any Releasee with respect to any and all Claims
released in this Agreement.

2.3 _No Assignment of Claims_. Each Releasor hereby represents and warrants
that it has not assigned, transferred, conveyed or otherwise disposed of any
Claim against any of the Releasees, or any direct or indirect interest in any
such Claim, in whole or in part, and that no other person or entity has any
interest in any of the Claims released in this Agreement.

2.4 _Adequacy of Information_. Each Releasor hereby represents and warrants
that it has adequate information regarding the terms of this Agreement, the
scope and effect of the releases set forth herein, and all other matters
encompassed by this Agreement to make an informed and knowledgeable decision
with regard to entering into this Agreement, and that it has independently and
without reliance upon the Releasees or any statements or information from the
Releasees, made its own analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.

 

2.5 _Advice of Counsel_. Each Releasor acknowledges that it has had the
benefit of advice of competent legal counsel with respect to his decision to
enter into this Agreement.

2.6 _Sufficiency of Consideration_. Each Releasor acknowledges that the
consideration payable to it pursuant to the Purchase Agreement provides good
and sufficient consideration for every promise, duty, release, obligation,
agreement and right contained in this Agreement.

 

3\. _Miscellaneous_.

irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
Maryland, specifically the exclusive jurisdiction of Circuit Court for
Baltimore City (Maryland) (the " _Maryland Court_ ") . Any action arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, any documents referred to in this Agreement,
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be brought in
the Maryland Court. The parties hereby waive, and agree not to assert, any
objection or defense to suit in the Maryland Court based on venue, _forum non
conveniens_ , or jurisdiction. The parties further waive, and agree not to

jurisdiction or authority to hear disputes or enforce documents arising out of
or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The parties irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such
action shall be heard and determined in the Maryland Court. The parties agree
that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action in
the manner provided in _Section 3.7_ hereof or in such other manner as may

3 3.2 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

3.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect. Any such term or provision held invalid, illegal, or
incapable of being enforced only in part or degree will remain in full force
and effect to the extent not held invalid, illegal, or incapable of being
enforced. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced, such term or provision is hereby
deemed modified to give effect to the original written intent of the parties
to the greatest extent consistent with being valid and enforceable under
applicable law.

 

3.4 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of each of the parties hereto, the Releasees and their respective
successors and assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party hereto may
assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder (by
operation of law or otherwise) to any person without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, and any assignment or transfer in
violation of this proviso shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the prior
sentence, each Purchasers rights and obligations under this Agreement may be
assigned and delegated in whole or in part, and without the consent of the
Seller Parties, to (i) one or more Subsidiaries of such Purchaser or (ii) in
the case of the Ski Purchaser, to Och-Ziff Real Estate Acquisitions LP;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment shall relieve such Purchaser
of its obligations hereunder.

3.5 _Acknowledgement_. Each Seller Party acknowledges that (a) this Agreement
is a material inducement for the Purchasers to enter into the Purchase
Agreement and effect the transactions contemplated thereby, and (b) the
Purchasers will be relying on such Seller Partys execution and delivery of
this Agreement and such Seller Partys agreement to be bound by the terms
hereof.

3.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail of a pdf attachment shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 

3.7 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications
hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given, delivered and received if
delivered or sent in accordance with Section 11.2 of the Purchase Agreement.

   (a) | Adjustments Related to the Leased Attractions 
---|--- 

(i) _Taxes_.

 

(1) Each Tenant under a Company Lease for a Leased Attraction is responsible
for paying all Taxes with respect to such Leased Attraction directly to the
Governmental Authority or applicable owners association, utility district or
any other body, therefore Taxes shall not be subject to proration under this
Section.

 

(2) If the Tenant at Hawaiian Falls  The Colony or Hawaiian Falls  Garland
has not paid all personal and real property Taxes with respect to either
Hawaiian Falls  The Colony or Hawaiian Falls  Garland as contemplated in
Section (1) above, the following shall apply: (x) the Attractions Purchaser
Closing Cash Consideration shall be decreased by the amount of all delinquent
Taxes assessed against both Hawaiian Falls  The Colony and Hawaiian Falls 
Garland for all prior years and all delinquent current year Taxes that are due
and payable on or before the Closing Date. and (y) to the extent that all
personal and real property Taxes for the current year or any prior year have
accrued but are not yet due and payable, such amounts shall be paid by the
Attractions Purchaser when such Taxes become due and payable following the
Closing Date, and the Attractions Purchaser Closing Cash Consideration shall
be decreased by the amount thereof that is attributable to the period prior to
the Closing Date, based on prorating such Taxes using a 365-day year (with
such decrease determined using the most recent bill for such Taxes available
at Closing, as adjusted by any known changes relating to the period during
which the Closing occurs).

 



2 (ii) _Seasonal Rent_. For each Leased Attraction,

 

(1) The Attractions Purchaser Closing Cash Consideration shall be increased by
the amount equal to the product of (a) the aggregate annual seasonal rent due
under the applicable Company Leases for all Leased Attractions other than
Hawaiian Falls  The Colony or Hawaiian Falls  Garland for the period from
January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 divided by 365, _multiplied_ _by_
(b) the number of days between January 1, 2017 and the actual Closing Date
(excluding the Closing Date);

 

(2) If prior to the Closing Date, the Seller Parties actually receive a
payment of annual seasonal rent from any Tenant relating to any period
commencing on or after January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, the
Attractions Purchaser Closing Cash Consideration shall be decreased by the
amount of such payment actually received; and

 

(3) If, as of the Closing Date, the Tenant at Hawaiian Falls  The Colony or
Hawaiian Falls  Garland is not in payment default (i.e., all rent, ground
rent and required capital expenditure payments have been paid, and all
security deposits contain the amounts required under the applicable Company
Leases), the Attractions Purchaser Closing Cash Consideration shall be
increased by the amount equal to the product of (a) the portion, if any, of
the annual seasonal rent due under the applicable Company Leases for Hawaiian
Falls  The Colony or Hawaiian Falls  Garland for the period from January 1,
2017 through December 31, 2017 divided by 365, multiplied by (b) the number of
days between January 1, 2017 and the actual Closing Date (excluding the
Closing Date). If, as of the Closing Date, the Tenant at Hawaiian Falls  The
Colony or Hawaiian Falls  Garland is in payment default (i.e., any of the
rent, ground rent or required capital expenditure payments have not been paid,
or the applicable security deposit contains less than the amount
required under the applicable Company Leases), any 2017 rental payments for
such properties actually received by the Attractions Purchaser after the
Closing in excess of the amount required to restore the security deposits
relating to such properties shall be delivered to the Company until all such
payments equal the product of (a) the portion, if any, of the annual seasonal
rent due under the applicable Company Leases for Hawaiian Falls  The Colony
or Hawaiian Falls  Garland for the period from January 1, 2017 through
December 31, 2017 divided by 365, multiplied by (b) the number of days between
January 1, 2017 and the actual Closing Date (excluding the Closing Date).

 

(iii) _Ground Rent_. If the Ground Lease rent at either Hawaiian Falls  The
Colony or Hawaiian Falls  Garland is delinquent as of the Closing Date, the
Attractions Purchaser Closing Cash Consideration shall be decreased by the
amount of all delinquent Ground Lease rent for such Company Properties as of
the Closing Date. If, following Closing, the Attractions Purchaser or the
Ground Lessor receives reimbursement of any such delinquent ground lease
payments from the Tenant at Hawaiian Falls  The Colony or Hawaiian Falls 
Garland, the Attractions Purchaser shall remit any such payment actually
collected to the Company promptly following receipt thereof.

(iv) _Percentage Rent_. Notwithstanding any other language set forth herein to
the contrary,

 



3 (1) The Seller Parties shall be entitled to all percentage rent paid under
any Company Leases for a Leased Attraction with a calculation date of
December 31, 2016 or earlier (which percentage rent is set forth on _Schedule
(a)(iv)(1)_ attached hereto) if, when and to the extent actually received. The
Attractions Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect
such percentage rent on behalf of the Seller Parties following Closing to the
extent the same is not received by the applicable Seller Party prior to
Closing and shall remit any such payments actually collected to the Company
promptly following receipt thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Attractions Purchaser shall not have any obligation to commence any legal
action or proceeding to collect such percentage rent on behalf of the Seller
Parties; _provided_ _further_ that the Seller Parties shall have the right to
pursue any legal action, proceeding or remedy (other than eviction) against
the Tenants for past due and unpaid percentage rent as provided in the
applicable Company Lease.

(2) The Attractions Purchaser shall be entitled to all percentage rent
paid under any Company Lease for a Leased Attraction with a calculation date
of January 1, 2017 or later (which percentage rent is set forth on _Schedule
(a)(iv)(2)_ attached hereto). The Seller Parties shall promptly remit to the
Attractions Purchaser any such payments of percentage rent actually received
by the Seller Parties on or after the Closing Date.

(3) If prior to the Closing Date, the Seller Parties actually receive a
payment of percentage rent with a calculation date of January 1, 2017 or later
from any Tenant, the Attractions Purchaser Closing Cash Consideration shall be
decreased by the amount of such payment actually received.

(v) _Accounts Receivable_. No adjustment to the Attractions Purchaser Closing
Cash Consideration shall be made to reflect any accounts receivable relating
to any of the Leased Attractions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller
Parties shall be entitled to draw upon any available security deposits without
deduction under clause (vi) below and/or to commence any legal action or
proceeding against any Tenant to collect any past due and unpaid accounts
receivable.

 

(vi) _Security Deposits_.

 

(1) The Attractions Purchaser Closing Cash Consideration shall be decreased by
the amount of all cash security deposits that are held by any Seller Party or
Target Company pursuant to a Company Lease relating to the Leased Attractions
as of the Effective Date, which cash security deposits are set forth on
_Schedule (a)(vi)(1)_ attached hereto. For Hawaiian Falls  The Colony and
Hawaiian Falls  Garland, if the amount of the security deposit increases
between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, the Attractions Purchaser
Closing Cash Consideration shall be decreased by the amount of
security deposit in place at Closing instead of the amount set forth on
_Schedule (a)(vi)(1)_ on the Effective Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Seller Party or Target Company may utilize the amount of any increase in
security deposit for any purpose permissible under the Company Leases for
Hawaiian Falls  The Colony and Hawaiian Falls  Garland. _Schedule
(a)(vi)(1)_ will be updated as of the Closing Date. Following Closing, the
Attractions Purchaser shall be responsible for the return of such deposits in
accordance with the applicable Company Lease.

 



4 (2) The Attractions Purchaser Closing Cash Consideration shall be increased
by the amount of all security deposits relating to the Leased Attractions
that are held by any Ground Lessor pursuant to the applicable Ground Lease,

hereto;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent such security deposits
or any portions thereof are applied prior to the Closing Date pursuant to the
terms of the applicable Ground Lease, the Attractions Purchaser Closing Cash
Consideration shall not be increased for the same. Following Closing, the
Attractions Purchaser shall be entitled to the return of such deposits in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Ground Lease.

 

(3) Additionally, the Seller Parties agree to transfer to the Attractions
Purchaser or its permitted assigns those certain letters of credit set forth
on _Schedule (a)(vi)(3)_ , which letters of credit are held as security
deposits by one or more of the Seller Parties pursuant to the applicable
Company Leases relating to the Leased Attractions. In no event shall
any Seller Party draw down on any such letter of credit prior to the Closing
Date.

(4) No later than three Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
the Seller Parties shall deliver to the Attractions Purchaser updated versions
of the schedules referred to in Sections (a)(vi)(2) and (3) above, which shall
provide the Seller Parties best estimates of the amount of each such
security deposit and letter of credit as of the Closing Date.

applies a cash security deposit to payment of any delinquent sums due and
payable under a Company Lease, and after the Closing Date the applicable
Tenant delivers a replacement security deposit to the Attractions Purchaser
or to the applicable Target Company (as the case may be), then the Attractions
Purchaser shall remit (or shall cause the applicable Target Company to so
remit) to the Seller Parties an amount equal to such replacement security
deposit. 

(vii) _Capital Expenditure Commitments_. The Attractions Purchaser Closing
Cash Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to the lesser of (1)

agreement with the landlord, or other reasonable and customary
documentation).

(1) _Schedule (a)(viii)(1)_ sets forth a list of each capital expenditure

to the Attractions Purchaser an updated version of this schedule, which shall
provide the Seller Parties best estimates of the amount contained in each
such account as of the Closing Date.

 



5 (2) The Attractions Purchaser Closing Cash Consideration shall be decreased by
an amount equal to the amount held as of Closing in the Leased Attractions
Reserve Accounts described on _Schedule (a)(viii)(1)_ attached hereto.

 

(3) The Attractions Purchaser acknowledges that, effective as of the Closing,
the Attractions Purchaser shall be responsible for payment of all unpaid
invoices that relate to any capital expenditures, goods delivered or services
performed in connection with the Leased Attractions which are payable from the
Leased Attractions Reserve Accounts in accordance with the terms of the
Company Leases for the Attractions, without regard to when such services were
performed or such goods were delivered.

(ix)  _Other Liabilities_. Without duplication of any of the foregoing
adjustments, the Attractions Purchaser Closing Cash Consideration will be
decreased by the aggregate amount of all Other Liabilities of the Target
Companies that own Leased Attractions or the U.S. Asset Sellers that own
assets relating to the Leased Attractions.



   (b) | Adjustments Related to the Ski Properties 
---|--- 

(i) _Taxes_. Each Tenant under a Company Lease for a Ski Property is
responsible for paying all Taxes with respect to such Ski Property directly to
the Governmental Authority or applicable owners association, utility district

(1) The Ski Purchaser Closing Cash Consideration shall be increased by the
amount equal to the product of (a) the aggregate annual seasonal rent due

of such payment actually received.

(3) If after the Closing Date, the Ski Purchaser receives a payment of
any annual seasonal rent from the Tenant for the Seasonal Leased Ski Property
commonly known as Mountain High on or after January 1, 2017, then the Ski

the numerator of which is equal to the number of days in the period commencing
on January 1, 2017 and ending on the day

 



6  immediately preceding the Closing Date and the denominator of which is equal
to 365. Conversely, if prior to the Closing Date a Seller Party receives a
payment of any annual seasonal rent from the Tenant for the Seasonal Leased
Ski Property commonly known as Mountain High specifically relating to any
period commencing on or after January 1, 2017, then the Ski Purchaser Closing

this schedule. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if
and to the extent that any of the delinquent rents and loan amounts shown on

prior to the Closing Date, then the Ski Purchaser Closing Cash Consideration
shall be decreased by the amount so collected. At the Closing the Seller
Parties shall cause CLP Lending I, LLC to assign the Mountain High Loan (and

without limitation, that certain Loan Agreement and Guaranty dated June 12,

from the Closing Date through the last day of the applicable month
(including the Closing Date).

 



7 (2) If, prior to the Closing Date, the Seller Parties have not actually
received payment of the Monthly Rent from a Tenant with respect to the month

Purchaser Closing Consideration, as the case may be, shall be increased by
the amount equal to the product of (a) the aggregate amount of Monthly Rent
due from all applicable Tenants for such month divided by the number of
calendar days in such month, _multiplied by_  (b) the number of days from the
first day of the applicable month through the Closing Date (excluding the
Closing Date).

 

(3) If, prior to the Closing Date, the Seller Parties have not actually

delinquent Monthly Rent for such month, and thereafter there shall not be any
further adjustment to the Ski Purchaser Closing Cash Consideration or the

have been appointed with due care by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent, its

cases, they act in good faith in accordance with any opinions, instructions or

OF THE THIRD PART. 

 

WHEREAS:



   A. | Pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement made as of the _ _
day of November, 2016 among, _inter alia_ , Cypress ULC and the Canadian
Purchaser, (as amended from time to time, the "Purchase Agreement"), Cypress
ULC agreed to sell and the Canadian Purchaser agreed to purchase the ULC
Canadian Assets; 
---|--- 



   B. | The parties hereto have directed payment to the Escrow Agent on
the Closing of an amount in respect of that portion of the Canadian Purchase
Closing Consideration that is due on Closing and that is applicable to the
ULC Canadian Assets, as more particularly set out in Schedule "A" hereto (the
"Withheld Amount"), to be held in escrow pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement; and 
---|--- 
 



   C. | All capitalized terms which are used in this Agreement, which are
not otherwise defined herein, shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the
Purchase Agreement. NOW THEREFORE in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable
consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged)
the parties hereby agree and declare as follows:



   1. | INTERPRETATION 
---|--- 

(a) _General_

 

Headings contained herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and
are not to be considered for the purposes of interpretation. All monetary
references are to Canadian dollars and all references to time are to Toronto
time. References to sections, subsections and parts are to those of this
Agreement. If anything herein is to be done or held on a day which is not a
Business Day, the same shall be done or held on the next succeeding Business
Day. Words importing the singular shall include the plural and vice versa.

(b)  _Governing Law_

This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of
the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein and the
parties shall attorn exclusively to the jurisdiction of the Courts of the
Province of Ontario.

(c) _Entire Agreement_

This Agreement, together with the Purchase Agreement and other documents to be
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between
the parties pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede
all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether
oral, written or otherwise, of the parties. There are no representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements between the parties in connection
with the subject matter of this Agreement except as specifically set forth in
this Agreement. No supplement, modification, amendment, waiver or
termination of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by
the party to be bound thereby.



   2. | APPOINTMENT OF ESCROW AGENT 
---|--- 

(a) Canadian Purchaser and Cypress ULC (together, the "Transaction Parties")
hereby appoint the Escrow Agent to act in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment on the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

 

(b) The Escrow Agent hereby acknowledges receipt on the date hereof of the
Withheld Amount. The Withheld Amount, together with the interest earned
thereon, shall be released by the Escrow Agent from escrow in the manner
hereinafter prescribed.



   3. | INVESTMENT OF WITHHELD AMOUNT 
---|--- 

(a) _Direction re Investment_

 

Each of the Transaction Parties hereby authorizes and directs the Escrow Agent
to invest the Withheld Amount with all interest accrued thereon in an
interest-bearing account, a bankers acceptance, other short term interest
bearing instrument of a bank listed in Schedule I of the _Bank Act_ (Canada)
or such other investments permitted by the Law Society of Upper Canada as
the Transaction Parties and the Escrow Agent shall agree upon with all
interest thereon to be credited in the manner hereafter prescribed.

(b) _Interest on the Withheld Amount_

The Transaction Parties agree that any interest earned on the Withheld Amount
(including interest on interest) (collectively the "Escrow Interest") shall
be held in escrow and be released or returned in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. The Escrow Interest shall be retained by the Escrow Agent
until the date when the balance of the Withheld Amount is fully released
pursuant to Section 4 hereof. Each of

 



\- 2 -  Cypress ULC and the Canadian Purchaser represents and warrants to the Escrow
Agent that it is not a non-resident for the purposes of the _Income Tax Act_
(Canada) (the "ITA") and, accordingly, no income tax is required to be
withheld by the Escrow Agent on the release of any interest to Cypress ULC or
the Canadian Purchaser, as the case may be.

 

(c) _Benefit of Interest_

To the extent that the Withheld Amount is not required to be released
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, such Withheld Amount will be
considered to be owned by Cypress ULC and Escrow Interest earned on such
Withheld Amount shall be for the benefit of Cypress ULC.

(d) _Investment_

The amounts held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Agreement are at the
sole risk of the Transaction Parties and, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility or liability for
any diminution of the Withheld Amount which may result from any investment
made pursuant to this Agreement.



   4. | RELEASE OF WITHHELD AMOUNT AND ESCROW INTEREST 
---|--- 



     | (a) | _Mutual Release_ 
---|---|--- 

Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the Escrow Agent shall, at
any time it holds the Withheld Amount and Escrow Interest or any part thereof,
release and distribute the Withheld Amount and Escrow Interest or any part
thereof in accordance with (i) a written direction delivered to the Escrow
Agent which has been executed by each of the Transaction Parties; or (ii) a
direction or order of the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division) (the
"Court") in any proceedings between the Transaction Parties, with any
applicable appeal periods having expired.



     | (b) | _Cypress ULC Release_ 
---|---|--- 

The Escrow Agent is irrevocably authorized and directed by each of the
Transaction Parties to remit all of the Withheld Amount to the Canadian
Purchaser and the Escrow Interest to Cypress ULC following receipt of a
written direction delivered to the Escrow Agent by Cypress ULC (with a copy to
the Canadian Purchaser) to such effect.



     | (c) | _Other Release_ 
---|---|--- 

Where the Escrow Agent has not been provided with either a mutual release or
a Cypress ULC release pursuant to Section 4(a) or 4(b) hereof, respectively,
prior to the day that is 24 months following Closing, the Escrow Agent is
irrevocably authorized and directed by each of the Transaction Parties, to
remit on or after the day that is 24 months following Closing, all of the
Withheld Amount to the Canadian Purchaser and all of the Escrow Interest to
Cypress ULC.



   5. | REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
---|---

and warrants to the other parties hereto, with respect to itself only, as
follows: (a) it has full legal right, power and authority to enter into and
perform all of its respective obligations under this Agreement; (b) the

the transactions contemplated hereby, do not and will not violate any other
agreement to which it is a party; (c) this Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and

 



\- 3 -  delivered and constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms except as (i) the enforceability
hereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar
applicable laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, and
(ii) the availability of equitable remedies may be limited by equitable
principles of general applicability; and (d) its execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do
not require the consent, waiver, approval, licence or authorization of or any
filing with and governmental authority or other person and will not violate,
result in a breach of, or the acceleration of any obligation under, or
constitute a default under, any provision of its constating documents, or any
indenture, mortgage, lien, lease, agreement, contract, instrument, order,
law, rule, regulation, judgement, ordinance, decree, or restriction by which
it or any of its properties or assets is bound.



   6. | ESCROW AGENT DUTIES AND LIABILITIES 
---|--- 

(a) The Escrow Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities other than
those expressly set forth in this Agreement, and no implied duties or
obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall have no duty to enforce any obligation of any person, other
than as provided herein.

(b) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by
it, or any action suffered by it to be taken or omitted, in good faith, and
in the exercise of its own best judgment, and shall not be held liable for any
error in judgment made in good faith, unless it shall be proved that the
Escrow Agent was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts or acted
intentionally in bad faith.

(c) The Escrow Agent may rely, and shall be protected in acting, upon any
judgment, order, notice, demand, direction, certificate or other instrument,
paper or document which may be submitted to it in connection with its duties
hereunder and the directions incorporated therein and which is believed by the
Escrow Agent to be genuine and signed or presented by the proper person(s),
and may accept the same as sufficient evidence of the facts stated therein.
The Escrow Agent shall in no way be bound to call for further evidence
(whether as to due execution, validity or effectiveness, or the jurisdiction
of any court, or as to the truth of any fact), and shall not be responsible
for any loss that may be occasioned by its failing to do so.

(d) In the event that the Escrow Agent shall become involved in any
arbitration or litigation relating to any amount held in escrow, the Escrow
Agent is authorized to comply with any decision reached through such
arbitration or litigation.

 

(e) If the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights
hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any party
hereto or from a third person with respect to any matter arising pursuant to
this Agreement which, in its opinion, are in conflict with any provision of
this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action
authorized and directed hereunder until it shall be authorized or directed
otherwise in writing by both Canadian Purchaser and Cypress ULC, or by an
order of a court of competent jurisdiction from which no further appeal may be
taken.

 

(f) The Escrow Agent shall not be required to use, advance or risk its own
funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of
its duties or the exercise of any of its rights under this Agreement other
than any such liability as may arise from the failure of the Escrow Agent to
perform such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement or as a
result of the wilful misconduct, fraud or negligent acts or omissions on the
part of the Escrow Agent or its representatives.

 



\- 4 - ---|--- 

Cypress ULC agrees to pay to the Escrow Agent reasonable legal fees, plus
applicable harmonized sales tax, for the time spent by the Escrow Agent in
carrying out its obligations under this Agreement together with disbursements
incurred by the Escrow Agent in respect of this Agreement. Any amount owing
hereunder and remaining unpaid after thirty (30) days from the invoice date
will bear interest at the then current rate charged by the Escrow Agent
against unpaid invoices, shall be payable on demand and shall form part of
the Escrow Agents remuneration hereunder.



   8. | INDEMNIFICATION OF ESCROW AGENT 
---|--- 

In addition to, and without limiting any other protection of the Escrow Agent
hereunder or otherwise by law, each of the Transaction Parties shall, on a
joint and several basis, defend, indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent, and its
partners, harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, claims,
damages, penalties, actions, suits, demands, levies, costs, expenses and
disbursements including any and all legal and adviser fees and disbursements
of whatever kind or nature which may at any time be suffered by, imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against the Escrow Agent whether groundless or
otherwise, howsoever arising from or out of any act or omission of the Escrow
Agent unless arising from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the
part of the Escrow Agent. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, this
indemnity shall survive the removal or resignation of the Escrow Agent or
termination of this Agreement.



   9. | RESIGNATION, REMOVAL OF ESCROW AGENT 
---|--- 

The Escrow Agent may resign its trust and be discharged from all further
duties and liabilities hereunder after giving thirty (30) days notice in
writing to each of the Transaction Parties provided, however, that such
shorter notice may be given as such parties shall accept as sufficient. In
case of the resignation of the Escrow Agent or its removal from office or
incapacity to act, its successors shall be at once appointed by the
Transaction Parties provided that such successor so appointed shall be either
a law firm comprised of lawyers authorized to practise law in the Province of
Ontario or a trust company qualified to carry on trust business in the
Province of Ontario and there shall not exist a material conflict of interest
in its role as a fiduciary under this Agreement; but should the Transaction
Parties fail to make such appointment then such successor shall be appointed
by a Judge of the Ontario Court (General Division) upon the application of any
party hereto at the expense of the Transaction Parties and given in such
manner as the said Judge may direct. On any new appointment the new Escrow
Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and
responsibilities as if it had been originally named as the Escrow Agent
without any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed, but there shall be
immediately executed, at the expense of the Transaction Parties, all such
instruments (if any) as the new Escrow Agent may be advised by counsel to the
Escrow Agent, acting reasonably, are necessary or advisable. Any such new
successor Escrow Agent shall, forthwith upon appointment, become vested with
all the estates, properties, rights, powers and trusts of its predecessors in
the trusts hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Escrow Agent
herein and upon receipt of a written authorization and direction from each of
the Transaction Parties to such effect, the Escrow Agent shall promptly
deliver the balance of the Withheld Amount and all interest earned thereon to
the successor Escrow Agent.



   10. | DELIVERY OF FUNDS TO COURT 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding any other term in this Agreement or the Purchase Agreement,
the Escrow Agent shall have the right to deliver the Withheld Amount and
Escrow Interest into a court of competent jurisdiction and, if such deposit is
made, the Escrow Agent shall be relieved of and discharged from any
further obligations under this Agreement whatsoever.

 



\- 5 - ---|--- 

The Escrow Agent may employ or retain such counsel, experts or advisers as it
may reasonably require for the purpose of discharging or determining its
duties, obligations or rights hereunder and may pay reasonable remuneration
for all services so performed by any of them, and shall not be responsible for
any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such experts or advisers who
have been appointed with due care by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent, its
partners, officers, directors, employees and agents shall incur no liability
and shall be fully protected in acting or not acting in accordance with any
opinion, instruction or advice of counsel or such expert so long as, in all
cases, they act in good faith in accordance with any opinions, instructions or
advice. The cost of such services shall be added to and be part of the Escrow
Agents fees hereunder.



   12. | ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

Attn: Chief Financial Officer and Deputy General Counsel



   Re: | REIT Opinion required under Purchase and Sale Agreement dated _
_  _ _, 2016 
---|--- 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

In connection with and pursuant to Section 9.3(g) of the Purchase and Sale
Agreement by and among CNL Lifestyle Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation
(" _CNL_ "), CLP Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, EPR Properties,
a Maryland real estate investment trust (" _EPR_ "), Ski Resort Holdings LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company, and the other Sellers named in such
agreement dated _ _ _ _, 2016 (the "Purchase and
Sale Agreement"), CNL has requested certain opinions as to EPRs
qualification as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (a " _REIT_ ") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ ").

You have requested that we express our opinion as to the qualification of EPR
as a REIT under the provisions of Sections 856 through 860 of the Code
commencing with EPRs taxable year that ended on December 31, 2006, as well as
EPRs continued qualification as a REIT after the consummation of the
"Attractions Purchaser Interest Sale," the "Attractions Purchaser Asset Sale"
and the other "Contemplated Transactions" as such terms are defined in the
Purchase and Sale Agreement (collectively, the "Transactions"). With your
consent, for purposes of this opinion, we assume that the Transactions will
be recognized as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes in
accordance with Section 8.12(b) of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.

 

The opinions expressed herein are based on certain representations made by EPR
as to factual matters as set forth in EPRs registration statements on Forms
S-3 and S-11 most recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _Prior Registration Statements_ "). In connection with the opinion
expressed herein, we have reviewed such documents and made such inquiries as
we have deemed necessary as a basis for such opinion. In addition, EPR has
made certain factual representations to us as set forth in an Officers
Certificate dated _ _ _ _, 2017 (the " _Officers
 Certificate_"), as referenced in Section 8.22 of the Purchase and Sale
Agreement, and, with EPRs permission, we have relied upon such factual
representations in expressing our opinions herein. In expressing our opinion
herein, we have assumed, with your consent, that (i) the statements and
representations set forth in the Prior Registration Statements and the
Officers Certificate are true and correct, (ii) the Officers Certificate has
been executed by appropriate and authorized officers of EPR and (iii) no
action has been taken that is inconsistent with the representations in such



 

   ![LOGO](g284856g43b24.jpg)  CNL Lifestyle Properties, Inc.

 

 _ _  _ _, 2017

Page  2 



 

 Officers Certificate or will be taken by EPR subsequent to the date hereof
that is inconsistent with EPRs status as a REIT. Although we have not
independently investigated the factual basis for the representations set
forth in the Prior Registration Statements or set forth in the Officers
Certificate, nothing has come to our attention that would lead us to question
the accuracy of any such representation.

 

Based on the foregoing and subject to the limitations and assumptions set
forth herein, we are of the opinion that:

 

Beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2006 and through the date
of this opinion, EPR has been organized and operated in conformity with the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, and EPRs current and proposed method of operation, including
with the inclusion of the assets acquired as a result of the Transactions,
will enable EPR to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and
taxation as a REIT for its current and subsequent taxable years.

 

The opinions expressed herein are based on existing law as contained in the
Code and regulations promulgated thereunder, in effect on the date hereof,
and the interpretations of such provisions and regulations by the Internal
Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") and the courts having jurisdiction over such
matters, all of which are subject to change either prospectively
or retroactively, and to possibly different interpretations. Also, any
variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the Prior
Registration Statements or the Officers Certificate may affect the opinions
expressed herein. Moreover, EPRs continuing qualification and taxation as a
REIT depend upon EPRs ability to meet, through actual annual operating
results, distribution levels and diversity of share ownership, the various
qualification tests imposed under the Code. We do not undertake to monitor
whether EPR actually will satisfy such tests. Accordingly, no assurance can be
given that the actual results of EPRs operations for any taxable year will
satisfy such requirements.

 

The opinions expressed herein are limited to the specific issues addressed
herein, and we express no opinion, whether by implication or otherwise, as to
any matters beyond that expressly stated herein. The opinions expressed herein
represent our legal judgment, but they have no binding effect or official
status of any kind, and no assurance can be given that contrary positions
may not be successfully asserted by the IRS or a court. This letter shall not
be construed as or deemed to be a guaranty or insuring agreement. The opinions
expressed herein are rendered as of the date first written above and we have
no continuing obligation hereunder to inform you of changes of law, including
judicial interpretations of law, or of facts, circumstances, events or
developments of which we become aware after the date hereof and which may
alter, affect or modify the opinions expressed herein.

Very truly yours, Exhibit S
