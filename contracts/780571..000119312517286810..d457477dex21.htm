provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_ the certificate of incorporation of
the Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read identically
to the certificate of incorporation of Acquisition Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such amended and
restated certificate of incorporation shall become the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and such certificate of
incorporation (subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_);
_provided_ that at the Effective Time the certificate of incorporation of the

19 (b) _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of  _Section_
__ _ 6.10(a)_, the bylaws of Acquisition Sub, as in effect immediately prior

(subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_).

2.6 _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the directors of Acquisition Sub

certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 

(b) _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall become the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation (other than as set forth in _Schedule 2.6_ , as such

each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are
duly appointed.

2.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, or the holders
of any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

 

(i) _Company Common Stock_. Each Share that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than (A) Cancelled Company Shares and (B) any
Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to
the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon the surrender of
the certificate formerly representing such Share (or, in the case of
Uncertificated Shares, surrender of such Uncertificated Shares) in the manner
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the manner provided
in _Section_ __ _ 2.10_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shares subject to
outstanding Company RSUs, Company 2015 PSUs or Company 2017 PSUs shall be
treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.7(e)_, _Section_ __ _ 2.7(f)_
and _Section_ __ _ 2.7(g)_, respectively.

 

(ii) _Excluded Company Common Stock_. Each Share owned by Parent, Acquisition
Sub or the Company, or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent or Acquisition Sub or by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the
Company, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Cancelled
Company Shares"), shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof or consideration paid therefor.

(iii) _Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub_. Each share of common stock of
Acquisition Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into

 



20  one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such
shares of common stock of Acquisition Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership
of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock but excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, the granting or other issuance of Company Options, Company
RSUs or Company PSUs in the ordinary course of business), reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or
other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after
the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time, and to provide to the
converting holders herein the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action, provided, that nothing in this Section 2.7(b)
shall be construed as permitting the Company to take any action or enter into
any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

 

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by Company Stockholders who shall neither have voted in favor of
the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly and
validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such
Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, "Dissenting
Company Shares") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to
receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)_, but
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder
of Dissenting Company Shares. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Company
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
cease to exist, and each Company Stockholder who holds Dissenting Company
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ that
all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights
to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the
DGCL shall no longer be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or
certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares in the manner provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.8_.

 

(ii) The Company shall provide Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to consult with
the Company concerning, and to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to, demands for appraisal under Delaware Law in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any such demands for
payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

 



21 (d) _Company Options_.

 

(i) _Unvested In-the-Money Company Options_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and without any action on the part
of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any holder of a Company Option,
each Company Option, other than a Non-Employee Director Option, that remains
outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that has a per share exercise price that is less than the Merger
Consideration, and that is held by a then-current service provider, shall be
assumed by Parent at the Effective Time and shall be converted into and become
an option to acquire Parent Common Stock (each, an "Adjusted Option"), on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under the corresponding Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, as follows:

(A) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Adjusted
Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of Shares that were
subject to the corresponding unvested Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down
to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock;

(B) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of each Adjusted Option shall be determined by dividing the
applicable per share exercise price of the corresponding Company Option, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Exchange Ratio,
and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; and

(C) any restriction on the exercise of any Adjusted Option shall continue in
full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule,
accelerated vesting rights, and other provisions of such Company Option shall
otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption of such Company
Option, in each case except to the extent otherwise provided in any Stock
Plan, or any stock option, employment, change of control or other agreement
between the holder of a Company Option and the Company; _provided_ that
Parents board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed as to the
authority and responsibility of the Company Board or any committee thereof
with respect to any Adjusted Option.

 

The adjustments to the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to the Adjusted Options determined under the mechanic set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)(i)_ shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 424 and Section 409A of the Code.

 

(ii) _Vested In-the-Money Company Options. _Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and without any action on the part of
Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any holder of a Company Option, each
Company Option that remains outstanding and is vested as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time and that has a per share exercise price that is less
than the Merger Consideration, shall not be assumed by Parent and shall
instead be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for a payment by Parent
of an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of
Shares subject to such vested Company Option multiplied by (y) the excess of
the Merger Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price under
such vested Company Option. As of the Effective Time, each holder of a vested

 



22  Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the foregoing consideration.

 

(iii)  _Out-of-the-Money Company Options._ Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and without any action on the part of
Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any holder of a Company Option, each
Company Option that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, and that has a per share exercise
price that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, become vested and exercisable by the
holder thereof and, each such Company Option shall, to the extent not
exercised as of the Effective Time, be cancelled at the Effective Time with
no payment made therefor.

(iv) _Unvested In-the-Money Non-Employee Director Options_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and without any action
on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any holder of a
Company Option, each Company Option that is held by a non-employee member of
the Company Board, that is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and that has a per share exercise price that is less than
the Merger Consideration (each, a "Non-Employee Director Option"), shall not
be assumed by Parent and shall instead be cancelled at the Effective Time in
exchange for a payment by Parent of an amount in cash equal to the product of
(x) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Non-Employee Director
Option multiplied by (y) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the per
share exercise price under such Non-Employee Director Option. As of the
Effective Time, each holder of a Non-Employee Director Option shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
foregoing consideration.

 

(e) _Company Restricted Stock Units_.

 

(i) _Unvested RSUs_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition
Sub, the Company or any holder of Company RSUs, each unvested Company RSU,
other than a Non-Employee Director RSU, that remains outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including each Company 2017 PSU as
to which the performance criteria has been satisfied or deemed satisfied under
Section 2.7(g) of this Agreement and that is held by a then-current service
provider) shall be assumed by Parent at the Effective Time, (each, an
"Adjusted RSU") and shall be converted into a restricted stock unit to
receive, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under the corresponding Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time,
a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of Shares that
were subject to the corresponding Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting
number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock. Any
restriction on the settlement of any Adjusted RSU shall continue in full force
and effect and the term, settlement terms, vesting schedule (subject to any
vesting acceleration terms contained in an applicable Employee Plan set forth
on Section 3.17(k) of the Company Disclosure Letter) and other material
provisions of the corresponding Company RSU or Company 2017 PSU shall
otherwise remain unchanged in all material respects as a result of the
assumption and conversion of such Adjusted RSU, except that Parents board of
directors or a committee thereof shall succeed as to the authority and
responsibility of the Company Board or any committee thereof with respect
to any Adjusted RSU.

 



23 (ii) _Vested RSUs_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition
Sub, the Company or any holder of Company RSUs, each Company RSU (or portion
thereof) that remains outstanding and is fully vested as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall not be assumed by Parent and shall be cancelled
and automatically be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in cash for each Share subject to such Company RSU.
As of the Effective Time, each holder of a vested Company RSU shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash for each share subject to such vested Company RSU.

 

(iii) _Non-Employee Director RSUs_. Any Company RSU held by a non-employee
member of the Company Board that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a "Non-Employee Director RSU"), whether vested or
unvested, shall not be assumed by Parent and shall instead become fully vested
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and then cancelled and
automatically be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in cash for each Share subject to such Non-Employee
Director RSU. As of the Effective Time, each holder of a Non-Employee Director
RSU shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in cash for each Share subject to such Non-
Employee Director RSU.

 

(f) _Company 2015 PSUs_. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, all outstanding Company 2015 PSUs shall terminate without the payment
of any consideration therefor and the holders of such terminated Company 2015
PSUs shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto.

 

(g) _Company 2017 PSUs_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
performance conditions of the Company 2017 PSUs that are outstanding as of
immediately prior the Effective Time shall be deemed satisfied at 100% of the
target level of achievement (notwithstanding any contrary provision in any
agreement or document governing or evidencing the relevant Company 2017
PSU and regardless of whether the Effective Time occurs in 2017 or 2018).
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any
holder of Company 2017 PSUs, (i) the portion of each Company 2017 PSU that
remains outstanding and unvested as to service-based vesting conditions as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as an Adjusted RSU in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(e)_ and (ii) the portion of each Company
2017 PSU (if any) that is outstanding and vested as to both performance
conditions and service-based conditions as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and automatically be converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash for
each Share subject to such fully-vested Company 2017 PSU, and as of the
Effective Time, the holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except to receive the Merger Consideration in cash for each
Share subject to such fully-vested Company 2017 PSU.

 

(h) _Company ESPP_. From and after the Agreement Date, the Company will not
establish any new offering period under the Company ESPP. Participation in
the Company ESPP shall be limited to those employees who were participants on
the Agreement Date and each individual participating in any current purchase
period will not be permitted to (i) increase his or her payroll contribution
rate pursuant to the Company ESPP from the rate in effect immediately

 



24  prior to the Agreement Date; or (ii) make separate non-payroll contributions
to the Company ESPP that has the effect of increasing his or her contribution
rate in effect immediately prior to the Agreement Date, except, in each case,
as may be required by applicable Law. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will take all action that may be necessary to, effective upon the
consummation of the Merger, (A) cause any Purchase Period (as defined in the
Company ESPP) that would otherwise be outstanding at the Effective Time to be
terminated no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date; (B)
make any adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the
shortened Purchase Period, but otherwise treat such shortened Purchase Period
as a fully effective and completed Purchase Period for all purposes pursuant
to the Company ESPP; (C) cause the exercise (as of no later than three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date) of each outstanding purchase right
pursuant to the Company ESPP; and (D) provide that no further Purchase Period
or purchase offer period will commence pursuant to the Company ESPP after the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding any restrictions on transfer of stock in the
Company ESPP, all Shares purchased under the Company ESPP shall be treated
identically to all other Shares in the Merger and the payment described in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)_. On such exercise date, the Company will apply the
funds credited as of such date pursuant to the Company ESPP within each
participants payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole Shares
in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP. Immediately prior to and
effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the
Merger), the Company will terminate the Company ESPP.

 

(i) _Further Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Company shall take
all actions reasonably necessary to (x) effect the transactions contemplated
by _Sections_ __ _ 2.7(d)_, _(e)_ , _(f)_ , _(g)_ and _(h)_ under all
Company Option, Company RSU, and Company PSU agreements, the Stock Plans, the
Company ESPP, and any other plan or arrangement of the Company, including
delivering all required notices and obtaining any required Consent, (y)
terminate, without consideration therefor, all outstanding compensatory equity
awards that are not Adjusted RSUs or Adjusted Options as of the Effective
Time (including awards held by then-former service providers), and (z) ensure
that, after the Effective Time, no Person shall have any right with respect to
outstanding equity-based awards of the Company or otherwise to acquire any
equity interest (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights)
in the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or the Surviving Corporation except,
as to this clause (z), as provided in _Sections 2.7(d), (e)_ and (g), and
(ii) if requested by Parent, the Company Board shall adopt any resolutions as
may be necessary to terminate any or all of the Stock Plans, effective as of
the Effective Time.

 

2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the "Payment Agent").

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or promptly following the Closing, but on the Closing
Date, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent,
for payment to the holders of Shares pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_ , an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to
which holders of Company Common Stock (other than Cancelled Shares, Dissenting
Shares and Shares subject to Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs)
become entitled under this _Article II_. Until disbursed in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such funds shall be invested by
the Payment Agent, as directed by

 



25  Parent or the Surviving Corporation (such cash amount being referred to
herein as the "Exchange Fund"). Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent that there are any
losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange
Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent
to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by this _Article II_ , Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to
make such payments contemplated by this _Article II_.

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder
of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate
or certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding Shares and (ii) uncertificated Shares (the
"Uncertificated Shares"), in each case, whose Shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_
(A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent),
and/or (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Shares represented by such
Certificate that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, by (y) the Merger
Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect
thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in
the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of
such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
aggregate number of Shares represented by such holders
transferred Uncertificated Shares that were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, by (y) the
Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect
thereof), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates and
transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.

 

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated

 



26  Shares surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer
books or ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated
Share so surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of
the Company only if such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the
Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by
Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger

the Company ESPP such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that such amounts are so
deducted, withheld and remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Shares for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned

automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in

Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement
procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the

claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

2.11 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and

the Surviving Corporation and Acquisition Sub shall take all such lawful and
necessary action.

Companys standard form for the relevant jurisdiction that may be terminated
for convenience by the Company with less than 35 days of advance notice, or by
the Company without liability for advance notice or severance in excess of
any statutory requirements. "International Employee Plans" shall mean each
Employee Plan that is maintained in any non-U.S. jurisdiction or
provides compensation or benefits primarily for the benefit of any current or
former employee or non-employee service provider of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their ERISA Affiliates. With respect to each Employee

Governmental Authority with respect to such plan and (y) any document

necessary to obtain the most favorable Tax treatment.

(b) No Employee Plan is, and none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
any of its or their ERISA Affiliates, or any of their respective predecessors

former ERISA Affiliate, to any material (1) Tax, penalty, fine, (2) lien or
(3) other liability imposed by applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code.

 

(c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a liability material to the Company and

maintained, operated and administered, in compliance with its terms and with
all applicable Law, including the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code.
Since January 1, 2014, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
taken any corrective action or made a filing under any voluntary correction

(f) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents
has, with respect to any Employee Plan, engaged in or been a party to any non-
exempt "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which could reasonably be expected to
result in the imposition of a material penalty assessed pursuant to Section
502(i) of ERISA or a material Tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, in each
case applicable to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Employee Plan
or for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any indemnification
obligation.

(g) No Employee Plan provides for any post-employment or post-retirement
welfare benefits to former employees or service providers of the Company or
its ERISA Affiliates (or their respective beneficiaries or dependents) beyond
their retirement or other separation from service, other than pursuant to
Section 4980B of the Code or any similar Law (and, except as set forth on
_Section_ __ _ 3.17(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, with the
participant bearing the premium costs). With respect to each Employee Plan
that is subject to Section 4980B of the Code, the Company and its Subsidiaries
have complied in all material respects with the continuation coverage
requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I

48  No Employee Plan that provides health insurance or medical coverage is self-
funded or self-insured.

 

(h) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be "qualified" under Section 401 of
the Code may rely on a prototype opinion letter or has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
fact, circumstance, or event has occurred or exists since the date of such
favorable prototype opinion letter or determination letter that
would reasonably be expected to affect the qualified status of any such
Employee Plan.

(i) Except as could not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a
liability material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, each
International Employee Plan (1) that is intended to qualify for special Tax

unfunded liabilities or liabilities that could reasonably be imposed upon the
assets of the Company or any Subsidiary by reason of such International
Employee Plan, (3) is and has been operated in compliance with its terms, any
applicable collective bargaining or other works council agreements, and all
applicable Laws, and (4) if intended or required to be qualified, approved or
registered with a Governmental Authority, is and has been so
qualified, approved or registered and nothing has occurred that could
reasonably be expected to result in the loss of such qualification, approval
or registration, as applicable.

 

(j) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a liability material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, all contributions, premiums and other
payments required to be made with respect to any Employee Plan by applicable
Law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and all premiums
due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any Employee Plan,
have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be
made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been accrued or reserved for
on the books and records of the Company in accordance with GAAP.

(k) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.17(k)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the execution or delivery of this Agreement, all other agreements and
documents contemplated hereby to which the Company is a party, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not,
either alone or in connection with any termination of employment (whether
voluntary, involuntary, with or without good reason, or with or without cause,
as a result of disability, death, retirement, or otherwise) or any other
employment-related event (1) result in any severance or payment or benefit
becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any current or former
director, officer, employee, or individual independent contractor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (2) trigger or accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or increase the amount or value of any benefit or
compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such current
or former director, officer, employee, or individual independent contractor,
(3) accelerate the timing of any funding obligation under any Employee Plan,
or (4) result in the forgiveness of Indebtedness for the benefit of any
current or former director, officer, employee or individual independent
contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(l) Neither the execution by the Company of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or upon
the occurrence of any additional or subsequent event) could reasonably be
expected to result in the payment of any

 



49  amount that would, individually or in combination with any other payment,
constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code. No Employee Plan provides for, and no Person is entitled to receive
any additional payment (including any Tax gross-up payment) from the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the imposition of additional
Taxes under Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code.

or incurred any liability or obligation under WARN or any similar foreign,

4.10 _Financial_ _Capacity_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, accurate and complete copy of
the executed commitment letter, dated as of the Agreement Date, by and among
Parent and the lenders party thereto (the "Lenders"), including all exhibits,
schedules, annexes and amendments thereto (the "Financing Commitments") and
the related fee letters (the "Fee Letters") with respect to fees and related
arrangements with respect to the Financing Commitments (provided that the
provisions in the Financing Commitments and Fee Letters relating to fee
amounts, pricing caps, 

 



61  market flex provisions and related provisions may be redacted so long as no
redaction covers terms that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the amount or availability or conditionality of the Financing), pursuant to
which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, the Lenders have
committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent for the purpose of
funding the Merger (such committed financing, together with (if applicable),
unless the context otherwise requires, any debt securities issued in lieu
thereof, the "Financing").

 

(b) As of the Agreement Date, (i) the Financing Commitments are in full force
and effect (subject to the Enforceability Limitations), and have not been
withdrawn, rescinded or terminated, or otherwise amended or modified in any
respect, and (ii) each of the Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable against it or
them, as the case may be, in accordance with its terms except as
enforceability may be affected by the Enforceability Limitations. As of the
Agreement Date there are, and, subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _
6.16_, as of the Closing there will be, no other agreements, side letters, or
arrangements relating to the Financing Commitments that could affect the
amount, availability or conditionality of the Financing other than as
expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments and the Fee Letters.

(c) As of the Agreement Date, no event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a material default or breach
on the part of Parent under any term or condition of the Financing Commitments
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, would (i) result in any of the conditions in
the Financing Commitments not being satisfied by the Closing Date or (ii)
otherwise result in the Financing not being available on the Closing Date. As
of the Agreement Date, assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ , and based on facts and events that Parent has Knowledge of,
Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely
basis all material terms and conditions of the Financing Commitments to be
satisfied by it or the Lenders, or that the Financing will not be available on
the Closing Date. As of the Agreement Date, no Lender party to any Financing
Commitment has notified Parent of its intention to terminate any of the
Financing Commitments or not to provide the Financing.

(d) Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees
or other fees required by the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before
the Agreement Date. The aggregate net proceeds from the Financing constitute
all of the financing required for the consummation of the Merger and, together
with cash and cash equivalents of Parent, are sufficient in amount for Parent
to (i) pay all amounts payable by it or Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Merger
under this Agreement, (ii) pay all associated fees, costs and expenses in
connection with the Merger, including the Financing, (iii) repay (or
refinance pursuant to a credit facility that will permit the Merger and
Financing) all outstanding borrowings and other payment obligations under the
Existing Parent Credit Agreement if the consent or waiver described in
_Section_ __ _ 6.16(b)_ is not obtained, and (iv) repay, retire and redeem in
full all Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 3.12(a)(viii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Required
Amount"). The Financing Commitments and Fee Letters contain all of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the
Financing available to Parent on the terms set forth therein. Parent
acknowledges that its obligation to consummate the Merger is not contingent on
Parents ability to obtain any financing whether pursuant to the
Financing Commitments or otherwise.

 



62 4.11 _Non-Reliance; Exclusivity of Representations_. 

(a) In connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company by
Parent and Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates, stockholders,
Representatives, or advisors, Parent and Acquisition Sub and their respective
Affiliates, stockholders, Representatives, and advisors have received and may
continue to receive after the Agreement Date (including pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 6.8_) from the Company and its Affiliates, stockholders,
Representatives, and advisors certain estimates, projections, forecasts and
other forward-looking information, as well as certain business plan
information, regarding the Company and its business and operations. Parent
and Acquisition Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent
in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking statements, as well as in such business plans, that Parent
and Acquisition Sub are making their own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to them (including
the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information or business plans). Accordingly, Parent
and Acquisition Sub hereby acknowledge and agree that none of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective Affiliates,
stockholders, Representatives, or advisors, nor any other Person, has made or
is making any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or
business plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business
plans).

 

(b) Except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this
_Article IV_ , (i) neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub (or any other Person)
makes, or has made, any representation or warranty relating to Parent or
Acquisition Sub or any of their Affiliates or any of their respective
businesses or operations or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) no Person has been authorized
by Parent or Acquisition Sub to make any representation or warranty relating
to Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of their Affiliates or any of their
respective businesses or operations or otherwise in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including as to the
accuracy or completeness thereof, and if made, such representation or warranty
must not be relied upon by the Company or any of its Affiliates or any
Representatives of any of the foregoing as having been authorized by Parent or
Acquisition Sub or any of their Affiliates (or any other Person on their
behalf).

6.3 _Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable (and in any event within 30 Business Days)
following the Agreement Date, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC
in preliminary form the Proxy Statement for use in connection with the
solicitation of proxies from the Company Stockholders for use at the Company
Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall also include the Fairness Opinion (in
its entirety) in the Proxy Statement together with a summary thereof. The
Company shall provide a true and complete signed copy of the Fairness Opinion
to Parent for information purposes as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Agreement Date. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules of the SEC and the NYSE. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall
furnish in writing to the Company all information concerning Parent and
Acquisition Sub as the Company may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement. If at any time
prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, any information relating to the
Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub, or any of their respective directors,
officers or other Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company, Parent or
Acquisition Sub which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other, and the Company shall prepare an appropriate
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement describing such information and
file such amendment or supplement with the SEC and,

 



74  to the extent required by applicable Law or the SEC or its staff,
disseminate such amendment or supplement to the Company Stockholders.

 

(b) Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to
be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable (and
in any event within five Business Days) following the earlier to occur of (i)
the 10th Business Day after the filing thereof with the SEC if the SEC or its
staff has not indicated that it will review the Proxy Statement and (ii)
confirmation from the SEC that it will not comment on, or that it has no
additional comments on, the Proxy Statement.

 

(c) Except for disclosures made that relate to a Company Board Recommendation
Change made by the Company Board or any authorized committee thereof in
accordance with the terms of _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, (i) the Company shall not
file with the SEC the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto,
and (ii) the Company shall not correspond or otherwise communicate with the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement, in any such case
referenced in the preceding clause (i) or (ii) without providing Parent and
Acquisition Sub a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon or
participate therein, as the case may be, and the Company shall include in the
Proxy Statement or any such amendment or supplement thereto all such
reasonable comments proposed by Parent in good faith.

 

(d) The Company shall advise Parent and Acquisition Sub, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff
for an amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, any receipt of comments
from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement, or any receipt of a request
by the SEC or its staff for additional information in connection therewith,
and shall as promptly as practicable provide Parent with copies of all
written correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or the staff thereof, on the other hand, with respect to the
Proxy Statement and as promptly as practicable provide Parent with a
reasonably detailed description of any oral comments received in connection
therewith. The Company also shall provide Parent with copies of any written
comments or responses to be submitted by the Company in response to any
comments or inquiries from the SEC or the staff thereof and shall provide
Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any
written response to any such written comments of the SEC or its
staff relating to the Proxy Statement and include in such response all
reasonable comments proposed by Parent in good faith. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the
Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable.

(e) Unless the Company Board or any authorized committee thereof shall have
effected a Company Board Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 6.5_, the Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement.

 

6.4 _Company Stockholder Meeting_.

 

(a) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall establish a record
date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the
Company Stockholders (or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "Company
Stockholder Meeting"), for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval and approve the Merger in accordance with the DGCL. Once the Company
has established the record date for the Company Stockholder

 



75  Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date without the prior
written consent of Parent, unless required by applicable Law. The Company
shall consult with Parent regarding the date of the Company Stockholder
Meeting, shall cooperate with Parent to initially schedule the Company
Stockholder Meeting to be held no earlier than 30 days and no later than 50
days after the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the
stockholders of the Company, and shall not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent; _provided_
that nothing herein shall prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning
the Company Stockholder Meeting:

(i) For sequential periods of up to five Business Days each, if there are
holders of insufficient Shares present or represented by a proxy at the
Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder
Meeting;

(ii) For so long as the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law, or an Order from the SEC or its
staff;

(iii) For up to five Business Days, if the Company Board or any authorized
committee thereof shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that it is necessary or appropriate to postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting in order to give Company Stockholders
sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has
sent to Company Stockholders or otherwise made available to Company
Stockholders by issuing a press release, filing materials with the SEC or
otherwise (including in connection with any Company Board Recommendation
Change); or

(iv) For one time only, for up to 10 Business Days from the date on which the
Company Stockholder Meeting was initially scheduled if, on a date for which
the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares to obtain the Requisite
Stockholder Approval.

(b) Without the prior written consent of Parent, a proposal for the adoption
of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger), and any matters related thereto,
shall be the only matters which the Company shall propose to be acted on at
the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 

(c) Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 8.1_, the Company shall solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger in
accordance with Delaware Law, submit this Agreement for adoption by the
Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting and, unless
the Company Board or any authorized committee thereof shall have effected a
Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_, use
its reasonable best efforts to secure the Requisite Stockholder Approval for
the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

6.5 _Company Board Recommendation_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.5(c)_, the Company Board shall make the
Company Board Recommendation.

 



76 (b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (x) withhold,
withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (y) approve, endorse or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal or (z) fail to recommend against acceptance of any
tender offer or exchange offer for Shares within 10 Business Days after the
commencement of such offer (each of clauses (x), (y) and (z), a "Company Board
Recommendation Change"); _provided_ that a "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Company Board to the Company Stockholders pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any substantially similar
communication, shall not be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation
Change.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval,
the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof may make a Company
Board Recommendation Change if and only if:

 

(i) (A) the Company has received an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that did not arise or result from a breach of  _Section_ __ _ 5.2_,
that constitutes a Superior Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal has not
been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal;

 

(B) the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that the failure to enter into a definitive agreement
relating to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law;

 

(C) the Company shall have notified Parent in writing of the Superior Proposal
and that it intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change,
including providing Parent with the identity of the Person making such
Superior Proposal and a copy of the then-current forms of all of the relevant
proposed transaction documents related thereto, including definitive
agreements (including financing agreements, if any) with respect to such
Superior Proposal (a "Superior Proposal Notice"); _provided_ that with respect
to any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such
Superior Proposal, Parent shall be entitled to a new written notice by the
Company (a "Superior Proposal Amendment Notice");

(D) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have made its Representatives
available to discuss with Parents Representatives any proposed modifications
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the period beginning as
soon as practicable on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such
Superior Proposal Notice or such Superior Proposal Amendment Notice, as
applicable, and ending at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on, in the case of a Superior
Proposal Notice, the fourth Business Day following the day of such delivery
or, in the case of a Superior Proposal Amendment Notice, the second Business
Day following the day of such delivery ( _provided_ that such two Business day
period shall be extended if applicable through the end of the original four
(4) Business Day period);

(E) the Company has during such four Business Day period or such two Business
Day period, as applicable, negotiated, and caused its financial and legal
advisors

 



77  to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) with respect to proposed adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal; and

(F) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company during such four Business
Day period or such two Business Day period, as applicable, a written offer to
modify the terms of this Agreement that if accepted by the Company in
accordance with the terms thereof would be binding upon Parent, the Company
Board and/or any authorized committee thereof shall have determined in good
faith, after considering the terms of such offer by Parent, that the Superior
Proposal giving rise to such Superior Proposal Notice or such Superior
Proposal Amendment Notice, as applicable, still constitutes a Superior
Proposal and that, in light of such Superior Proposal and the results of any
negotiations with Parent and any offer from Parent, that the failure of the
Company Board to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to
such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under Delaware Law; or

 

(ii) (A) an Intervening Event has occurred;

 

(B) the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in light of
such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the Company Board members
fiduciary duties under Delaware Law;

 

(C) the Company shall have notified Parent in writing of such Intervening
Event, including a reasonable description of such Intervening Event, and that
it intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change (an "Intervening
Event Notice");

(D) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have made its Representatives
available to discuss with Parents Representatives the Intervening Event and
any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
during the period beginning as soon as practicable on the day of delivery by
the Company to Parent of such Intervening Event Notice and ending at 5:00 p.m.
Pacific Time on the fourth Business Day following the day of such delivery;

 

(E) the Company has during such four Business Day period negotiated, and
caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to proposed
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the failure
to make such Company Board Recommendation Change is no longer a breach of the
Company Boards fiduciary duties; and

(F) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company during such four Business
Day period a written offer to modify the terms of this Agreement that if
accepted by the Company in accordance with the terms thereof would be binding
upon Parent, the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof shall
have determined in good faith, after considering the terms of such offer by
Parent, that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in
light of such Intervening Event would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Delaware Law.

 



78 (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board and/or any
authorized committee thereof from taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act (including making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
pending disclosure of its position thereunder); _provided_ __ that, (x) _
Section_ __ _ 6.5(d)_ shall not in and of itself permit the Company Board
and/or any authorized committee thereof to make a Company Board Recommendation
Change that would not otherwise be permitted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.5_, and (y) in any such case, any such statement(s) or disclosures made by
the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof will be subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_ and _Article VIII_.

 

6.6 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. The initial press release with respect
to the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press
release reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company prior to the
Agreement Date. None of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and
Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall issue any public release or make any
public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or
the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange
or regulatory or Governmental Authority to which the relevant party is subject
or submits, wherever situated, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the
other party or parties hereto reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance and shall give due consideration to
such comments (it being understood that the final form and content of any
such release or announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or
announcement, shall be at the final reasonable discretion of the disclosing
party); _provided_ that the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _
6.6_ shall not apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to be
made by the Company or Parent in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, a
Company Board Recommendation Change or Superior Proposal.

6.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any anti-takeover or other similar
Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

6.8 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the
properties, books and records and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and the Companys outside accountant); _provided_ that the
Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or
information (i) to the extent that any applicable Law requires the Company to
restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information, (ii)
to the extent that access to such documents or information would give rise to
a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to such documents or
information, or (iii) pursuant to mutually agreed

 



79  "clean team" procedures established by the parties, to the extent that
access to such documents or information could potentially be used by Parent in
a manner that would materially alter the competitive dynamic between Company
and Parent if the Merger were not consummated; _provided_ _,_ _further_ , that
no information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth
in this Agreement or otherwise impair the rights and remedies available to
Parent and Acquisition Sub hereunder. In the event that the Company does not
provide access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall
use its reasonable best efforts to communicate the applicable information to
Parent in a way that would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or
obligation or to waive such a privilege, including, to the extent practicable,
by providing such information in redacted form as necessary to preserve such a
privilege or comply with such Law or otherwise make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements, to the extent possible. Any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall be
conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct
of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage
or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be subject to the terms and conditions of any
applicable Lease and the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance
requirements and shall not include the right to perform invasive Phase 1 or
Phase 2 environmental assessments or other invasive testing. The terms and
conditions of the confidentiality letter agreement dated May 8, 2017 between
the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), shall apply to
any information obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in
connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _
6.8_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to require the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Representatives of any of the
foregoing to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other
information.

 

6.9 _Section_ __ _ 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is a director or executive officer of
the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

6.10 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects the
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all (i)
indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
identified in Section 3.12(a)(xiv) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and (x)
any of their respective current or former directors and officers as of the
Agreement Date pursuant to the terms of such agreements as in effect as of the
Agreement Date, and (y) any person who becomes a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and executes an
indemnification agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company and no
more favorable to such person than the current form of indemnification
agreement with its directors that has been made available to Parent (the
"Indemnified Persons") and (ii) indemnification, expense advancement and
exculpation provisions in any certificate of incorporation or bylaws or
comparable organizational

 



80  document of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the
Agreement Date. In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation
and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least
as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses
provisions contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or
other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of the Agreement Date, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall
not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner adverse to the
Indemnified Persons except as required by applicable Law. Any claims for
indemnification made under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10 _on or prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time shall survive such anniversary until
the final resolution thereof, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its applicable Subsidiaries to maintain sufficient funds for the payment
of their respective obligations to the Indemnified Persons under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall bind and purchase
directors and officers runoff insurance coverage in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time ("DandO Runoff
Insurance"), which by its terms shall survive the Merger for not less than
six years and covering each Person covered by the Companys current directors
and officers liability insurance policy in effect as of the Agreement Date
(which has been made available to Parent) (the "Current DandO Insurance"). The
DandO Runoff Insurance shall be on terms with respect to the coverage and
amounts that are substantially equivalent to those of the Current DandO
Insurance or, if substantially equivalent insurance is unavailable, the best
available coverage. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to) maintain the DandO Runoff Insurance in full force
and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as
such DandO Runoff Insurance shall be maintained in full force and effect.
Neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall be permitted or
required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Runoff Insurance in excess of
300% (the "Maximum Amount") of the last annual premium paid prior to the
Agreement Date for the Current DandO Insurance (it being understood and agreed
that in the event the cost of such DandO Runoff Insurance exceeds the Maximum
Amount, in the aggregate, the Company shall remain obligated to provide, and
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to maintain, the broadest DandO
Runoff Insurance coverage as may be obtained for the Maximum Amount). The
Company and Indemnified Parties may be required to make reasonable
application and provide reasonable and customary representations and
warranties to applicable insurance carriers for the purpose of obtaining such
DandO Runoff Insurance.

 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume
all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_.

 

(d) The obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ shall not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely
affects any Indemnified Person (or

 



81  any other Person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Runoff Insurance (and
their heirs and Representatives)) without the prior written consent of such
affected Indemnified Person or other Person who is a beneficiary under the
DandO Runoff Insurance (and their heirs and Representatives). The rights of the
Indemnified Persons (and other Persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Runoff Insurance (and their heirs and Representatives)) under this _Section_
__ _ 6.10_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights that such Persons may have under the certificates of incorporation,
bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all
indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ is not prior
to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

(f) Each of the Indemnified Persons or other Persons who are beneficiaries
under the DandO Runoff Insurance (and their heirs and Representatives) are
intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, with
full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto.

 

(g) This _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger.

 

6.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
thereof to, for a period ending on the date that is 12 months following the
Effective Time (or, if earlier, the date of termination of the applicable
Continuing Employee), provide the Continuing Employees with (i) at least the
same level of base salary or base hourly wage levels, if applicable, that
were provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) target cash incentive compensation opportunities (excluding any
one-time stay, retention, transaction or other discretionary bonuses) that
are at least equal with respect to individual target bonus levels to that
provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(iii) subject to the requirements of applicable Law in jurisdictions outside
of the United States, employee health, welfare and tax-qualified defined
contribution retirement benefits (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
equity-based awards, defined benefit, and non-qualified arrangements) that
are in the aggregate substantially comparable to either (A) the employee
health, welfare and tax-qualified defined contribution retirement benefits
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, equity-based awards, defined benefit,
and non-qualified arrangements) offered to similarly situated employees of
Parent or Parents Affiliates (each, a "Parent Plan"), or (B) the employee
health, welfare and tax-qualified defined contribution retirement benefits
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, equity-based awards, defined benefit,
and non-qualified arrangements) offered to such Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time, as disclosed in _Section_ __ _
6.11(a)(iii)(B)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, with the determination of
the employee benefits and their comparability under this clause (iii) to be
reasonably made by Parent from time to time, and (iv) upon an involuntary
termination without cause of a Continuing Employee, severance benefits that
are required by applicable Law, or, if none, that are no less favorable than
those that

 



82  would have been provided to each such Continuing Employee under the
applicable Employee Plans that are severance benefit plans, programs, policies
or arrangements as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, as
disclosed in _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)(iv)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
(such payments and benefits, the "Transaction Severance Benefits"), in all
cases (i) through (iv), as measured on an individual basis. In the event the
Company has not then made a determination of bonus amounts to be paid and paid
such amounts due under its 2017 annual bonus or incentive plan as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause each employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is a participant in the Companys
2017 annual bonus or incentive plan to be paid a bonus in respect of the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 in accordance with the terms of such
plan as in effect on the Agreement Date, as if the applicable performance
targets were fully achieved at target levels, except that Parent reserves the
right to cause such bonuses to be paid solely in cash.

 

(b) With respect to the employee health and welfare benefit plans and defined
contribution retirement plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries in which
Continuing Employees participate following the Closing, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to, cause to be
granted to each Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and any predecessor employer (to the extent the Company
and its Subsidiaries recognized or provided such past service credit) prior to
the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
entitled, before the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and, with respect to vacation, sick time or paid time
off, accrual and severance pay entitlement); _provided_ that such service will
not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage
or benefits, or with respect to employees outside of the United States if
applicable foreign Law would forbid the provision of such service credit. For
purposes of each Parent Plan in which any Continuing Employee is eligible to
participate after Closing, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to use
commercially reasonable efforts to, cause its third party administrators or
third party insurance providers to (x) cause all waiting periods, pre-
existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements
and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such Parent Plan to be waived
for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent
it would have been waived under the comparable Company Employee Plan, and (y)
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents under a comparable Company Employee Plan during the
plan year of the Company Employee Plan in which the Closing Date occurs to be

any reason; (ii) prevent the amendment, modification, or termination 

 



83  of any agreement with a Continuing Employee after the Effective Time; or

dependents thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with
respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and benefits
that may be provided to any officer, director, consultant, or other service
provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of the Affiliates or under any benefit plan which any of
them may maintain, or otherwise, except that the Company may enforce these

Closing Date. The Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k)
Plan(s) have been timely terminated pursuant to resolutions of the
Company Board and, as applicable, any ERISA Affiliate of the Company. The
form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the prior review

and, if applicable, such other appropriate form of registration statement)
with respect to those shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to
the Adjusted Options and Adjusted RSUs, and (ii) shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so
long as such Adjusted Options and Adjusted RSUs remain outstanding; and (iii)

notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant to such Adjusted Option or
Adjusted RSU.

Subsidiaries), and (iii) make any and all required filings and notices and any
and all required communications with Company Employees and obtaining any

to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in any such case
if and only to the extent that such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure,

contemplated hereby set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ and _Section_ __ _
7.2(b)_ to not be satisfied at the Closing;  _provided_ that no such
information or notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any

conditions to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies available to the
parties hereunder; _provided_ , ___further_ , that the terms and conditions of

failure of Parent or Acquisition Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that
such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to
cause any of the conditions to the obligations of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.3(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ to not be satisfied at the Closing;
_provided_ that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any

the parties hereunder; _provided_ , ___further_ , that the Company shall
maintain the confidentiality of information provided to the Company pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.13(b)_ in the same manner as Parent would be
required to maintain the confidentiality of such information under the
Confidentiality Agreement if such information had been disclosed to it by the
Company.

borrowings and other payment obligations pursuant to a credit facility that

Parent to satisfy its obligations under _ Section 6.16(a)_, any portion of
the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms (including any market flex
provisions) and subject to the conditions contemplated in the Financing

increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount in
respect of the Financing) below the amount required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) add conditions precedent to
the Financing or amend, replace, supplement or modify any existing conditions

expects to have a material and adverse impact on the ability of Parent to
obtain all or any material portion of the Financings contemplated by the
Financing Commitments sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement on the terms, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Financing Commitments or the definitive documents related
to the Financing, or Parent, for any reason, otherwise no longer believes in
good faith that it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on
the terms described in the Financing Commitments. As soon as reasonably
practicable, Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by
the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i) through

_Section_ __ _ 6.16(f)_ to the contrary, Parent is not required to disclose
or provide any information the disclosure of which in Parents reasonable
good faith judgment is prohibited by applicable Law or Order, is subject to
attorney-client privilege, or would reasonably be expected to result in the
disclosure of any Trade Secrets of third parties or violate any obligation of
Parent with respect to confidentiality not entered into to avoid the
disclosure obligations of this _Section_ __ _ 6.16(f)_.

Competing Acquisition Transaction was the same Competing Acquisition
Transaction referred to in clause (B) of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_. For
purposes of the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(i)_ only,
a "Competing Acquisition Transaction" shall have the same meaning as an

to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination
Fee concurrently with and as a condition to the effectiveness of such

circumstance in which Parent receives payment of the Termination Fee pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, the receipt of the Termination Fee in such
circumstance shall, except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach of this
Agreement by the Company, constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent,
Acquisition Sub, Parents Subsidiaries and any of their respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees
("Parent Related Parties") against the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of
its or their former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Affiliates or assignees (collectively, the "Company Related Parties") for any
and all losses and damages suffered or incurred as a result of the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder prior to the date of such termination,
and, upon Parents receipt of the Termination Fee in such circumstance, none
of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby or in respect of any other document, theory of law or
equity or oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith or therewith, in contract, in tort or otherwise (except that (x) the
Company shall be obligated pursuant those provisions that expressly survive
such termination in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, (y) the obligations
under the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue to survive, and (z) the
Company shall also be obligated with respect to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_).
Except as expressly provided in this clause (iv), following the receipt of the
Termination Fee in such circumstance, and, except in the case of fraud or
Willful Breach of this Agreement by the Company, (A) none of Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any Parent Related Party shall be entitled to bring,
maintain or support any Legal Proceedings against the Company or any Company
Related Party arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof or the transactions contemplated
hereby (or the

 



97  abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for
such termination, and (B) Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause any Legal Proceedings pending in connection
with this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or the
transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent maintained by Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any Parent Related Party against the Company or any
Company Related Party to be dismissed with prejudice promptly.

(v) The Company shall make any required payment of the Termination Fee by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent.

(c) _Equitable Relief_. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in
this Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to
obtain an injunction, or other appropriate form of equitable relief, to cause
Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the Merger at any time if, and only
if, and the Company shall not otherwise be entitled to obtain any injunction
or other form of equitable relief to cause Parent and Acquisition Sub to
effectuate the Merger, unless, each of the following conditions has been
satisfied: (A) all conditions in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_
(other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until
the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions)
have been satisfied, and remain satisfied, at the time when the Closing would
have occurred, (B) Parent and Acquisition Sub fail to complete the Closing by
the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.3_ (taking into account any extension of the Termination Date in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(i))_, and (C) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed that if specific performance is granted, then the Closing will
occur. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_
shall prohibit the Company from seeking an injunction, specific performance
and/or other equitable relief pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.7_ prior to the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _
7.2_ being satisfied or waived.

 

(d) _Single Payment Only_. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable
under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different
times and the occurrence of different events.

 

(e) _Liquidated Damages_. Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub
acknowledges and agrees that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section_
__ _ 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated
damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent, in the
circumstances in which such fee is payable, and which do not involve fraud or
Willful Breach of this Agreement, for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision and (iii) without these agreements, the Parent would not have
entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay
any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_,
the Company shall pay Parent its costs and expenses in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of two percent
plus the prime rate as published in _The_

 



98   _Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate
as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

(f) _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Company, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, (i) agrees that none of
the Financing Sources or their respective current, former, or future
Affiliates and Representatives shall have any liability or obligation (whether
at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates relating to this Agreement or the breach,
termination, or validity hereof or any transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Financing and the Financing Commitments) (ii) waives
any rights or claims against any of the Financing Sources and their
respective current, former, or future Affiliates and Representatives in any
way relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, or validity hereof
or any transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing
and the Financing Commitments), whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise and (iii) agrees not to, and shall not, seek to enforce this
Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement, or seek to
recovery monetary damages (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any special,
consequential, punitive, indirect, speculative, or exemplary damages or
damages of a tortious nature) from, any Financing Source or any of their
respective current, former. or future Affiliates and Representatives (in each
case without limitation to any rights the Company may have against Parent
and/or Acquisition Sub).

9.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments
and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred
to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter, the Annexes hereto, and
the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement among the

validly terminated by the parties thereto.

9.5 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and

third-party beneficiaries of, and are entitled to rely on and enforce
directly,  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, _Section_ __ _
9.8_, _Section_ __ _ 9.9_, _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, _Section_ __ _ 9.11_,

(e) this _Article IX_ in respect of the Sections set forth under the foregoing
clauses (a) through (d). The representations and warranties in this Agreement
are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto, without notice
or liability to any other Person. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of the

rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this

9.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, such
provisions in other jurisdictions will remain in effect and, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further

valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_, and
except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and
the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that, in the
event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one

 



101  hand, or Parent and/or Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement, by the other (as applicable), and to

breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement. The Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand hereby agree
not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement by such party (or parties), and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such party (or parties) under this Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such Order or
injunction.

 

9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law

9.11 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company; _provided_ that (a) in the

9.3_, _Section_ __ _ 9.8_, _Section_ __ _ 9.9_, _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, this

Representatives without the prior written consent of such Financing Source.

party or parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or
parties, as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this
Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.
