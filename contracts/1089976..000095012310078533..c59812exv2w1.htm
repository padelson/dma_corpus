CONVERSION OF SHARES 

  

 Section 3.1 _Conversion of Shares_. 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, each share of the Companys common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ hereof and Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive $33.25 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") without any interest thereon. 

  

 (b) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (c) All shares of Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall, at the Effective 

    ##### 

 

  

Time, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (d) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time of shares of outstanding Common Stock not represented by certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and the holders of certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of outstanding Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Book-Entry Shares or Certificates in accordance with _Section 3.2_ , the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, for each such share of Common Stock held by them. 

  

 Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates Representing Common Stock_. 

  

 (a) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deliver or cause to be delivered, in trust, to a paying agent selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock at the Effective Time, sufficient funds for timely payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Consideration Fund_ ") to be paid pursuant to this _Section 3.2_ in exchange for all outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares). 

  

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (i) a letter of transmittal that shall specify that delivery of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have occurred, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, the form and substance of which letter of transmittal and instructions shall be substantially as reasonably agreed to by the Company and Parent and prepared prior to the Closing. Upon surrender of a Book-Entry Share or a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and with such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_ , and the Book-Entry Share or Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than a Person in whose name the Book-Entry Share or Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is 

   ##### 

  

 

registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Book-Entry Share or Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

   

 (c) The Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that any such investments shall be in (i) securities issued or directly and fully guaranteed or insured by the United States government or any agency or instrumentality thereof and having maturities of not more than one month from the date of investment or (ii) money market mutual or similar funds having assets in excess of $1,000,000,000. Earnings on the Consideration Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Surviving Corporation and shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation, as the Surviving Corporation directs. No investment of the Consideration Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this _Article III_, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Consideration Fund. If, at any time prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or loses such holders right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL, Parent shall promptly provide, or cause the Company to promptly provide, additional funds to the Paying Agent in the amount of the Merger Consideration payable with respect to Dissenting Shares held by such holder. 

  

 (d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article III_, except as otherwise provided by Law. 

  

 (e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the Consideration Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such 

   ##### 

  

    

Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, and any holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
who has not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with respect
thereto shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of
its claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof. 

  

 (g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent) by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which such Person is entitled in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this _Article III_. 

  

 (h) Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. 

  

 (i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 3.3 _Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_. 

  

 (a) Each outstanding option, whether or not vested or exercisable, granted under the Equity Plans (each, a " _Company Option_ "), shall be cancelled and converted into a right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of each such Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock covered by such holders Company Option (the " _Option Payment_ "), with such payment to be subject to applicable Tax withholding. Prior to the Effective Time, the committee of the Companys board of directors responsible for administering the Equity Plans shall have exercised its interpretive authority under the applicable adjustment provisions of the applicable Equity Plan to provide for the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of each holder of a Company Option to the cancellation of such holders Company Options in exchange for the Option Payment and such option holders acknowledgement that, upon receipt of the Option Payment, such holder will no longer have any rights with respect to any Company Option. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Not later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such actions as may be required to cause each restricted stock award granted under the Equity Plans and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (each, a " _Restricted Stock Award_ "), to fully vest as of the Effective Time and such Restricted Stock Award shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in the same manner as shares of Common Stock under _Section 3.1_, with such payment to be subject to applicable Tax withholding. 

  

 (c) Each outstanding performance share award or performance unit award granted under the Equity Plans (each a " _Performance Share Award_ ") shall be cancelled effective as of the Effective Time in exchange for a cash payment to be made by the Company to the holder of each Performance Share Award as of the Effective Time. The cash payment payable to each holder of a Performance Share Award shall be equal to the product of the (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) that number of shares determined as the sum of (x) with respect to any completed calendar year(s) or other measuring period(s) for a Performance Share Award, the number of shares notionally or conditionally vested by the Company for the portion of the holders Performance Share Award related to such year(s) or period(s) plus (y) with respect to any calendar year(s) or other measuring period(s) for which the Company has not allocated a notional or conditional number of shares (including the current and future years), the number of shares determined as if one hundred percent (100%) of any performance targets or goals were achieved during such year(s) or period(s) and assuming satisfaction of all other conditions for receiving the target amount with respect to all such awards had been met (the " _Performance Award Consideration_ "), with such payment to be subject to applicable Tax withholding. Except as otherwise required under the terms of the applicable award or as necessary to avoid the imposition of any additional taxes or penalties on any Performance Award Consideration pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, all amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 3.3(c)_ shall be paid as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, without interest. 

  

 (d) The Company shall cause each Equity Plan to be terminated, effective as of and conditioned upon, the Effective Time, subject to the satisfaction of the obligations set forth in this  _Section 3.3_. 

  

 Section 3.4 _Payout of Bonus, SERP and Deferred Compensation Plans_. 

  

 (a) Except as provided below, at the time the 2010 annual cash bonuses would have been paid under the terms of the applicable plan (or on the Closing Date for participants of the Amended and Restated Pactiv Corporation Change-in-Control Severance Benefit Plan for Key Executives), the Company shall pay to each participant who has been granted an annual cash bonus award in respect of the 2010 calendar year under each of the Companys Executive Incentive Compensation Plan and 2002 Incentive Compensation Plan a minimum bonus equal to a pro rata portion (based on elapsed time) of the cash payment that would have been made thereunder if one hundred percent (100%) of any performance targets or goals for the 2010 calendar year were achieved and assuming satisfaction of all other conditions for receiving payment had been met. 

   ##### 

  

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any participant who voluntarily terminates his
or her employment with the Company prior to the end of the 2010 calendar year
shall forfeit the right to any such minimum bonus. In the event the Closing
Date occurs in the 2011 calendar year, the principles set forth in this
_Section 3.4(a)_ shall apply to the same extent and in the same manner to
each participant who has been granted an annual cash bonus award in respect of
the 2011 calendar year. Any such bonus payments will be subject to applicable
Tax withholding. 

   

 (b) The Company shall pay to each participant under each of the Companys Deferred Compensation Plan and Deferred Retirement Savings Plan (collectively, the " _Deferred Compensation Plans_ "), the balance of each such participants deferred compensation account (whether vested or unvested) in a lump sum cash payment in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Deferred Compensation Plans. Any payment made under the Deferred Compensation Plans pursuant to this _Section 3.4(b)_ shall be subject to applicable Tax withholding and, if applicable, holding periods required by Section 409A of the Code. As of the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the Deferred Compensation Plans. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall adopt the amendment to the Pactiv Corporation Rabbi Trust substantially in the form set forth on Schedule 3.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (c) As of or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the Companys Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and pay to each participant thereof such participants accrued benefit in a lump sum cash payment, in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B). 

  

 Section 3.5 _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised his appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall cease to be outstanding and be cancelled. Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as set forth herein, unless and until the holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, his right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL and to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the DGCL. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Common Stock, and Parent shall have the opportunity to reasonably participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by Law, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

  

 Section 3.6 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes the number of shares of Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or stock dividend or stock distribution, or declares or pays any cash or other 

   ##### 

  

 

dividend or makes any other distribution, the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change or distribution and as so adjusted
shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration,
subject to further adjustment in accordance with this sentence.

 Section 5.8 _Proxy Statement_. None of the information supplied by Investor, Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, at the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

   

 Section 5.9 _Brokers or Finders_. No investment banker, broker, finder, consultant or intermediary is entitled to any investment banking, brokerage, finders or similar fee or commission in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Investor or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries. 

   

 Section 5.10 _Sufficient Funds_. Parent has delivered to the Company complete and accurate copies of (a) an executed commitment letter (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Credit Suisse AG, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., HSBC Bank USA, National Association, and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (the " _Lenders_ "), pursuant to which the Lenders have committed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth therein to Polaris Bridge Finance 1 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of an Affiliate of Parent (" _Bridge Finco_ "), a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Bridge Finco, Reynolds Group Issuer Inc., Reynolds Group Issuer LLC and Reynolds Group Issuer (Luxembourg) S.A. (collectively, the " _Bridge Loan Borrowers_ ") for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ "), (b) an executed commitment letter (the " _Affiliate Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Financing Commitments_ ") from Investor, pursuant to which Investor has committed to invest the amounts set forth therein, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein (the " _Affiliate Financing_ " and, together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ ") and (c) the fee letter associated with the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Fee Letter_ ") (it being understood that such letter has been redacted to omit the fee amounts provided therein). The Affiliate Commitment Letter provides, and will continue to provide, that the Company is a third-party beneficiary thereof. Bridge Finco is an Affiliate, but not a direct or indirect Subsidiary, of Parent. As of the date hereof, and, to Parents knowledge as of the date hereof of existing plans and intentions, as of the Closing, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the Merger set forth in  _Article VII_ hereof and the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties set forth in the penultimate sentence of _Section 4.5(a)_, the funds provided by the Financing, together with Parents and the Companys consolidated cash on hand (as of the date hereof and as of the Effective Time), will be, if funded at Closing, sufficient to fully fund all of Parents and Subs obligations under this Agreement in compliance with 

      ##### 

  

    

the terms hereof and the terms of the indebtedness of Parent or the Company or
their respective Subsidiaries, including payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration and payment of all fees and expenses related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any refinancing
of indebtedness of Parent or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries in
connection therewith. Except as set forth in (i) the Financing Commitments
and (ii) Section 2 of the Affiliate Commitment Letter, there are no
conditions precedent to the respective obligations of the Lenders to fund
the Debt Financing or of Investor to fund the Affiliate Financing. There are
no other agreements, side letters or arrangements that would permit the
Lenders to reduce the amount of the Debt Financing, that would permit
Investor to reduce the amount of the Affiliate Financing or that could
otherwise affect the availability of the Debt Financing or the Affiliate
Financing. The Affiliate Commitment Letter has been duly executed and
delivered by, and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of, Parent and
Investor and the Debt Commitment Letter has been duly executed and delivered
by, and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of, Parent and Bridge Finco
and, to the knowledge of Parent, all other parties thereto. There are no
contractual or, as of the date hereof, legal restrictions that would prohibit
the Bridge Note Issuers (as defined in Annex III to Exhibit B of the
Debt Commitment Letter) from causing the full amount of the proceeds of the
unsecured bridge loans and the proceeds of the Bridge Notes (as defined in
Annex III to Exhibit B of the Debt Commitment Letter), if received by the
Bridge Note Issuers, to be made available to Merger Sub in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The administrative
agent fee letter associated with the Debt Commitment Letter does not contain
any conditions precedent to the funding of the bridge facilities contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter or the issuance by certain Subsidiaries of
Parent of senior secured notes and senior notes as contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, each of the Financing
Commitments is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn or
terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect. All commitment
and other fees required to be paid under the Financing Commitments on or prior
to the date hereof have been paid and, as of the date hereof, to the
knowledge of Parent, there is no fact or occurrence existing that would make
any of the statements (including assumptions) set forth in any of the
Financing Commitments inaccurate in any material respect. Assuming no breach
or default by the Company under this Agreement, there is no fact or
occurrence known to Parent or Sub as of the date of this Agreement that would
cause the conditions to funding of the Financing not to be satisfied at or
before the Effective Time, and, subject to such assumption, neither Parent
nor Sub has reason to believe as of the date hereof that it will be unable to
satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by
it contained in the Financing Commitments. 

   

 Section 5.11 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the Merger, (b) the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement as of the Closing Date and compliance by the Company in all material respects with the covenants contained in this Agreement, and (c) the reasonability of any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries that were provided to Parent, immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any 

      ##### 

  

    

financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby), (i) the
fair value of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated
basis) will be in excess of their debts and liabilities, subordinated,
contingent or otherwise (on a consolidated basis), (ii) the present fair
saleable value of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated
basis) will be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the
probable liability of their debts and other liabilities, subordinated,
contingent or otherwise (on a consolidated basis), as such debts and other
liabilities become absolute and matured, (iii) Parent and its Subsidiaries (on
a consolidated basis) will be able to pay their debts and liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise (on a consolidated basis), as such
debts and liabilities become absolute and matured, and (iv) Parent and its
Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) will not have unreasonably small
capital with which to conduct the businesses in which they are engaged as
such businesses are now conducted and proposed to be conducted following the
Closing Date. Parent and Sub are not causing a transfer of property or
incurrence of an obligation in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of Parent, Sub, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. 

   

 Section 5.12 _Share Ownership_. None of Investor, Parent, Sub or any of their respective Affiliates beneficially owns any Common Stock. 

   

 Section 5.13 _Interested Stockholder_. Prior to the board of directors of the Company approving this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby for purposes of the applicable provisions of the DGCL, none of Investor, Parent, Sub or their respective Affiliates was at any time an "interested stockholder" (as defined in section 203 of the DGCL) with respect to the Company. 

   

 Section 5.14 _Absences of Arrangements with Management_. Other than this Agreement, as of the date hereof, there are no contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements or obligations or understandings between Investor, Parent or Sub or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys management or board of directors, on the other hand, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Company after the Effective Time. 

   

 Section 5.15 _Investigation by Parent and Sub_. Each of Investor, Parent and Sub has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the businesses, assets, condition, operations and prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries and acknowledges that each of Investor, Parent and Sub has been provided access to the records of the Company and its Subsidiaries for this purpose. In entering into this Agreement, each of Investor, Parent and Sub has relied solely upon the representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ and its own investigation and analysis, and each of Parent and Sub acknowledges that, except for the representations and warranties of the Company expressly set forth in _Article IV_, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Representatives makes any representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information provided or made available to Investor, Parent or Sub or any of their Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as expressly and specifically covered by a representation or warranty set forth in _Article IV_, none of the Company or its 

      ##### 

  

    

Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Representatives or any other Person
has made a representation or warranty to Investor, Parent or Sub with respect
to (a) any projections, estimates or budgets for the Company or its
Subsidiaries or (b) any material, documents or information relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries made available to each of Investor, Parent or Sub
or their Representatives in any "data room," confidential information
memorandum or otherwise.

 Section 6.2 _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to officers, employees, counsel, investment bankers, accountants, Financing Sources and other authorized representatives (" _Representatives_ ") of Parent reasonable access, in a manner not 

      ##### 

  

    

unreasonably disruptive to the operations of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to the properties, books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, during such period,
shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to
such Representatives all information concerning the business, properties,
Contracts, assets, liabilities and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may reasonably be requested; _provided_ _,_   _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to disclose any information to Parent or Sub if such disclosure would, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) violate applicable Law or the
provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party so long as the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to
obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure or
(ii) waive any attorney-client or other legal privilege so long as the
Company shall have used its reasonable best efforts to disclose such
information in a way that would not waive such privilege; _provided_  
_further_ _,_ _however_ , that nothing herein shall authorize Parent or its
Representatives to undertake any environmental investigations or sampling at
any of the properties owned, operated or leased by the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Parent agrees that it will not, and will cause
its Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this
_Section 6.2_ for any competitive or other purpose unrelated to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
confidentiality agreement, dated May 25, 2010 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between the Company and Investor shall apply
with respect to information furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries and
the Companys officers, employees and other Representatives hereunder. 

   

 Section 6.3 _Acquisition Proposals_. 

   

 (a) The Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, and will instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective officers, directors, employees and other Representatives not to, (i) initiate or solicit or knowingly encourage, directly or indirectly, any inquiries with respect to, or the making of, any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) except as permitted below, (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with, or furnish access to its properties, books and records or provide any information or data to, any Person(s) relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (B) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (C) execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in connection with the actions contemplated by _Section 6.3(b)_ that contains confidentiality provisions that are no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement) or (D) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill obligation. The Company shall, and shall direct each of its Representatives to, immediately cease any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent or Sub) that has made or indicated an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, in the event that the Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, the Company and its board of directors may participate in discussions or negotiations (including, as a part thereof, making any counterproposal) with, or furnish any information to, any Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives or potential sources of financing (provided that (i) such Person shall have first entered into a confidentiality agreement that contains confidentiality provisions that are no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) all such information has previously been provided or made available to Parent or is provided or made available to Parent substantially concurrently with the time it is so furnished) if, prior to taking any action described in this _Section 6.3(b)_, the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such Person is reasonably likely to submit to the Company an Acquisition Proposal that is a Superior Proposal. 

  

 (c) The Company will promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) notify Parent of the receipt by the Company of any Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include the material terms of and identity of the Person(s) making such Acquisition Proposal (including furnishing copies of any written materials evidencing such Acquisition Proposal). The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal and of any material amendments or proposed material amendments thereto (including promptly furnishing copies of any written materials evidencing such material amendments or proposed amendments) and will promptly notify Parent of any determination by the Companys board of directors that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. 

  

 (d) The board of directors of the Company shall not (i) approve, endorse or recommend a Superior Proposal or enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal or (ii) qualify, modify or amend in a manner adverse to Parent or withhold or withdraw (or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing) the Company Recommendation ((i) or (ii) above being referred to as a " _Change in Recommendation_ "); _provided_ that the board of directors of the Company may, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, make a Change in Recommendation (x) if an event, fact, development or occurrence that affects the business, assets or operations of the Company that is unknown to the Companys board of directors as of the date of this Agreement (an " _Intervening Event_ ") becomes known to the Companys board of directors if the Companys board of directors has, as a result thereof, determined, in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor), that the failure to make a Change in Recommendation would be reasonably likely to violate the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (y) in response to a Superior Proposal. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may not make a Change in Recommendation (including any disclosure pursuant to _Section 6.3(f)_ that would constitute a Change in Recommendation) unless (i) it notifies Parent in writing of its intention to take such action at least five (5) 

   ##### 

  

 

Business Days prior to taking such action, specifying the basis for the Change
in Recommendation in the case of an Intervening Event and, in the case of a
Superior Proposal, the material terms thereof, the identity of the Person(s)
making such Superior Proposal and copies of all relevant documents from such
Person(s) relating to such Superior Proposal, and (ii) Parent does not make,
after being provided with reasonable opportunity to negotiate with the Company
and its Representatives, within such five (5) Business Day period, an offer
that the board of directors of the Company determines, in good faith after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors, is at least as
favorable to the Companys stockholders as such Superior Proposal or, in the
case of a proposed Change in Recommendation as a result of an Intervening
Event, obviates the need for such a Change in Recommendation. Any material
amendment or modification to any Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section 6.3_;  _provided_ that
the notice period and the period during which the Company and
its Representatives are required to negotiate in good faith with Parent
regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
response to such new Acquisition Proposal pursuant to this paragraph (e)
above shall expire on the later to occur of (x) two (2) Business Days after
the Company provides written notice of such new Acquisition Proposal to
Parent and (y) the end of the original five (5) Business Day period described
above in this paragraph (e). 

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Companys board of directors from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders), or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the board of directors of the Company has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with any applicable Law; _provided_ that any such disclosure (other than a "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or any similar communication to the stockholders of the Company) shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to be a Change in Recommendation unless the Companys board of directors publicly states that it has not changed its previous recommendation with respect to the Merger within three (3) Business Days following any request by Parent. 

  

 Section 6.4 _Employee Benefits_. 

   

 (a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "), except as may otherwise be agreed, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who is not represented by a union or labor organization (each, a " _Non-Union Employee_ ") (i) compensation (including base salary, incentive compensation opportunities, and cash amounts equal to the value of equity compensation (determined based on the grant-date fair value) granted in the ordinary course (as opposed to special, one-time grants) and employee benefits to such Non-Union Employees for 2010, but excluding any compensation triggered in whole or in part by the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) that is no less favorable in the aggregate to the compensation and employee benefits provided to such Non-Union Employee immediately prior to the 

   ##### 

  

 

Effective Time, provided that neither the base salary nor the incentive
compensation opportunities shall be reduced from the levels provided to the
Non-Union Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the Non-Union Employees will not
participate in any stock based compensation plans or programs following the
Effective Time. Subject to the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the
Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement following the Effective Time to the extent permitted
under the terms of any such employee benefit plan, program or arrangement.
With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries following the Effective
Time and in which Non-Union Employees participate (the " _Parent Plans_ "),
for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits (but not for accrual of pension benefits)
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to
the extent the Company provides past service credit) shall be treated as
service with Parent or its Subsidiaries, as applicable;  _provided_ _however_
, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Such service also
shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods or evidence of
insurability requirements. Each Parent Plan shall waive pre-existing
condition limitations to the extent waived or not applicable under
the applicable Benefit Plan. Non-Union Employees shall be given credit under
the applicable Parent Plan for amounts paid prior to the Effective Time
during the year in which the Effective Time occurs under a corresponding
Benefit Plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent Plan. 

   

 (b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the appropriate Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation to assume (as appropriate) and honor in accordance with their terms the employment, employment termination, severance and other compensation agreements, plans and arrangements (collectively, the " _Continuing Company Plans_ "), in each case existing immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 6.4(a)_, nothing herein shall prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any Continuing Company Plan to the extent permitted under the terms of the applicable Continuing Company Plan. 

  

 (c) With respect to any Non-Union Employee not covered by the Companys Amended and Restated Change in Control Severance Benefit Plan for Key Executives, if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates the employment of such Non-Union Employee during the Continuation Period, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to such Non-Union Employee severance benefits as set forth in _Section 6.4(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (d) With respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are represented by a union or labor organization (the " _Union Employees_ "), Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to assume and honor all existing collective bargaining agreements between the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and a labor union or labor organization and provide such Union Employees with compensation and benefits as set forth in such collective bargaining agreements. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 6.5 _Publicity_. The initial press release by each of Parent and the Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. Unless the Companys board of directors has effected a Change in Recommendation, neither the Company nor Parent (nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release or make any other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior agreement of the other party, except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before making any such public announcements. 

   

 Section 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_. 

   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) honor any existing indemnification agreements to which the Company is a party and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company or any of its present or former Subsidiaries or corporate parents (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in connection with actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by Law. The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company on the date of this Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties. 

  

 (b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect for not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries for the Indemnified Parties and any other employees, agents or other individuals otherwise covered by such insurance policies prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Insured Parties_ ") with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement);  _provided_ that Parent and the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of substantially the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the Insured Parties. Alternatively, at Parents option, Parent may cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase at or after the Effective Time, or at the Companys option 

   ##### 

  

 

(subject to Parents consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), the Company may purchase prior to the Effective Time, a six-year
prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before
the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in
full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations
thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party
shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance
hereunder. 

   

 (c) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.6_. 

  

 (d) This _Section 6.6_ is intended to benefit the Insured Parties and the Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation. Parent hereby guarantees the payment and performance by the Surviving Corporation of the indemnification and other obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors, assigns and transferees of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective successors or assigns, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_. 

 

 Section 6.7 _Proxy Statement_. 

   

 (a) The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Companys stockholders (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company Special Meeting_ ") as soon as practicable following the date hereof for the purpose of considering the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger. Unless required by applicable Law, the Company shall not postpone the Company Special Meeting, or adjourn the Company Special Meeting if a quorum is present, without the prior written consent of Parent. 

  

 (b) In connection with the Company Special Meeting, as soon as practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) following the date hereof, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") relating to the Merger and this Agreement and furnish the information required to be provided to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the DGCL and any other applicable Laws. The Company shall 

   ##### 

  

 

provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement (which comments shall be reasonably considered by the Company). The
Company will advise Parent promptly of any comments on the Proxy Statement by
the SEC and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all
SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable
after receipt thereof. The Company shall consult with Parent and reasonably
consider in good faith its comments prior to responding to SEC comments with
respect to the Proxy Statement. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Recommendation and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Requisite Vote;
_provided_ , _however_  that if the Companys board of directors effects a
Change in Recommendation in accordance with  _Section 6.3_, the Company may
cease to use such efforts. A Change in Recommendation permitted by _Section
6.3_ will not constitute a breach by the Company of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_, the Company, regardless of whether the board of directors has approved, endorsed or recommended an Acquisition Proposal or has effected a Change in Recommendation, but in compliance with the DGCL, will call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Special Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof and will submit this Agreement for adoption by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Special Meeting. 

  

 Section 6.8 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to promptly (i) take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities and any third parties any actions, non-actions, clearances, waivers, consents, approvals, permits or orders required to be obtained by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) make all registrations, filings, notifications or submissions which are necessary or advisable, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under (A) any applicable federal or state securities Laws, (B) the HSR Act and any applicable competition, antitrust or investment Laws of jurisdictions other than the United States, and (C) any other applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and Parent will cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such filings, including providing copies of all such filings and attachments to outside counsel for the non-filing party; (iv) furnish all information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (v) keep the other party informed in all material respects of any material communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a 

      ##### 

  

    

private party, in each case relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (vi) permit the other parties to review any material communication
delivered to, and consulting with the other party in advance of any meeting
or conference with, any Governmental Entity relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or in connection with any proceeding by
a private party relating thereto, and giving the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences (to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity or private party); (vii) avoid the
entry of, or have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including defending any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;
and (viii) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No parties
to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary delay of the Closing at the
behest of any Governmental Entity beyond the Termination Date without the
consent of the other parties to this Agreement, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Without limiting this _Section 6.8_ , Parent agrees to
take, or to cause to be taken, any and all steps and to make any and
all undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any antitrust, merger control, competition, or trade regulation Law
that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so
as to enable the condition to the Closing regarding expiration of the waiting
period under the HSR Act to be satisfied no later than five days prior to the
Termination Date, including proposing, negotiating, committing to, and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, licensing or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent
(or its Subsidiaries) or the Company or otherwise taking or committing to
take actions that limit Parents or its Subsidiaries freedom of action with
respect to, or their ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines
or assets of Parent (or its Subsidiaries) or the Company, in each case, as
may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit
or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of this _Section
6.8_ shall not apply to each of Parent and Sub if compliance with this
_Section 6.8_ would result in, or would reasonably be expected to result in,
a material adverse effect on the combined business of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation at or after the Effective Time. 

   

 Section 6.9 _Financing_. 

   

 (a) Parent and Sub acknowledge and agree that their obligation to consummate the Closing is not subject to a financing condition under _Article VII_. 

  

 (b) Parent and Sub shall use their (and Parent shall cause Reynolds Group Holdings Inc. to use its) reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments, (ii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto in a timely manner and on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the Financing Commitments and (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent, Reynolds Group Holdings Inc. and Sub contained in such definitive agreements. In the event that any portion of the Financing 

   ##### 

  

 

becomes unavailable in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the
Financing Commitments, (A) Parent shall promptly notify the Company and (B)
Parent and Sub shall use their (and Parent shall cause Reynolds Group
Holdings Inc. to use its) reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any
such portion from alternative sources, on terms that are, in the aggregate, no
more materially adverse to Parent, Sub or the Company, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, including entering into
definitive agreements with respect thereto,  _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, neither Parent nor Sub shall be required to seek equity
financing from any source other than the Investor, or in any amount in excess
of or in any form other than that contemplated by the Affiliate Commitment
Letter (such definitive agreements entered into pursuant to the first or
second sentence of this _Section 6.9(b)_ being referred to as the "
_Financing Agreements_ "). All obligations of the parties set forth in
this Agreement with respect to the Financing shall apply with respect to any
Financing Agreements. Parent and Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Reynolds
Group Holdings Inc. to) seek to cause (i) Bridge Finco and the other Bridge
Loan Borrowers to draw the bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreements and/or (ii) certain Subsidiaries
of Parent to issue the Senior Notes, in each case, to the extent necessary to
cause the Closing to occur within five (5) Business Days of the first date
upon which all conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_
(other than _Section 7.2(c)_) are satisfied. Parent and Sub shall, shall
cause their Subsidiaries to, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause their Representatives to, comply with the terms, and satisfy on a
timely basis the conditions, of the Financing Commitments, the Financing
Agreements and any related fee and engagement letters. Parent shall (x)
furnish to the Company complete, correct and executed copies of the Financing
Agreements promptly upon their execution, (y) give the Company prompt notice
of any material breach by any party of any of the Financing Commitments or
the Financing Agreements of which Parent or Sub becomes aware or any
termination thereof and (z) otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed
of the status of Parents and Subs efforts to arrange the Financing (or any
replacement thereof). Parent and Sub shall have the right from time to time
to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify each of the Financing
Commitments; _provided_ that any such amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification shall not (1) reduce the amount of the Financing to an
amount below the amount that is required, together with Parents and the
Companys consolidated cash on hand that is not restricted cash or otherwise
unavailable to fund Parents and Subs obligations under this Agreement, to
fully fund all of Parents and Subs obligations under this Agreement, (2)
expand upon in any material respect the conditions precedent or contingencies
to the funding on the Closing Date of the Financing as set forth in the
Financing Commitments, or (3) contain terms that would reasonably be expected
to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Closing beyond
the timing contemplated by the prior Financing Commitments; and in any event,
Parent shall disclose to the Company promptly its intention to amend,
replace, supplement or modify any of the Financing Commitments and shall keep
the Company reasonably informed of the terms thereof;  _provided_ , _further_
, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Sub may amend the Debt
Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as
of the date of this Agreement. Any reference in this 

      #####

In this regard, the Company acknowledges that its cooperation obligations in _Section 6.9(c)_ include the obligation to cooperate with any such efforts.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability or obligation in connection with the Financing (or any replacements thereof) prior to the Effective Time for which it is not reimbursed or indemnified by Parent.

Parent or the Termination Date. 

  

 (d) by Parent: 

   

 (i) upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company, or if any representation or warranty of the Company shall be or become untrue, which in any case would give rise to the failure of the conditions set forth in  _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_; _provided_ that (x) if such breach is curable by the Company through the exercise of its reasonable best efforts and the Company is exercising its reasonable best efforts to cure such breach, Parent may not terminate this Agreement as a result of such breach unless such breach is not cured on or prior to the date that is the earlier of thirty (30) days after Parent has provided written notice of such breach to the Company or the Termination Date, and (y) the right to terminate this Agreement under this  _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ shall not be available to Parent if it is then in material breach of any of its covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement; or

For purposes of this Agreement, "willful breach" means a material breach that (1) is a consequence of an act undertaken or omitted by a party with the knowledge (actual or constructive) that the taking or omitting of such act would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement and (2) would prevent or materially delay the Closing or give another party to this Agreement the right not to consummate the Merger; it being understood and agreed that (x) a failure by Parent or Sub to consummate the Closing as a result of their inability to obtain the Financing shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to constitute a 

   ##### 

  

 

willful breach and (y) any breach of _Section 6.3_ that meets the description
of clause (1) of this definition shall constitute a willful breach. 

   

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated 

   

 (i) (x) by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, or (y) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, and such termination occurs after the fifth (5th) day following the date on which the Company makes a Change of Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal and (A) in the case of a termination described in clause (x) of this _Section 8.2(b)(i)_, there has been publicly disclosed after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time of the Company Special Meeting, an Acquisition Proposal which is not withdrawn prior to the time of the Company Special Meeting, and (B) in the case of a termination described in either clause (x) or clause (y) of this _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ , within twelve (12) months after such termination, either (1) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a transaction pursuant to any Acquisition Proposal or (2) such a transaction occurs, then the Company shall pay to or at the direction of Parent a termination payment of $160,000,000 in cash (the " _Termination Payment_ "), within two (2) Business Days after the consummation of the transaction contemplated by clause (B) above;  _provided_ , _that_ , solely for the purposes of this _Section 8.2(b)_ , the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in _Section 1.1_, except that all references in such definition to 25% shall be changed to 51%; and 

   

 (ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ (x) in the case of a Change in Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal, and such termination occurs on or prior to the fifth (5th) day following the date on which the Company makes a Change of Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal, or (y) in the case of a Change in Recommendation for any other reason, at any time, then the Company shall pay to or at the direction of Parent the Termination Payment. 

  

 (c) If Parent has not extended the Termination Date pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ and this Agreement is terminated by: 

   

 (i) the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_, and, at such time, 

   

 (1) all the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by deliveries at the Closing or are not satisfied due to a willful breach by Investor, Parent or Sub of any of their respective covenants or other agreements in this Agreement), and the Closing did not occur when required under _Section_  

   ##### 

  

    

 _2.3_ then (i) Parent shall pay to the Company a fee of $250,000,000 in cash
(the " _Parent Fee_ ") if none of Investor, Parent or Sub are in
willful breach of its covenants or other agreements in this Agreement and
(ii) Parent shall pay a fee of $500,000,000 (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") if
Investor, Parent or Sub are in willful breach of any of their respective
covenants or other agreements in this Agreement; _provided_ that Parent shall
not be required to pay any such amount if the Financing would not have been
available as a result of the failure of the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in the penultimate sentence of _Section 4.5(a)_ to be
true and correct in all material respects; or 

   

 (2) (A) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and  _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by deliveries at the Closing), other than the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(c)_ due to the failure to receive any required consent or clearance under Antitrust Laws from a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction or any action by any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction to prevent the Merger for antitrust reasons and (B) the failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(c)_ to be satisfied was not due to any requirement by any Governmental Entity as a condition to its approval of the transactions contemplated hereby that Parent or Sub agree to any divestiture or restriction that would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a material adverse effect on the combined business of Parent and the Surviving Corporation at or after the Effective Time, then Parent shall pay to the Company the Maximum Amount;  _provided_ that (x) if Parent would not have been able to consummate the Closing because the Financing would not have been available and none of Investor, Parent or Sub is in willful breach of its covenants or other agreements in this Agreement, Parent shall only be obligated to pay to the Company the Parent Fee, and not the Maximum Amount and (y) Parent shall not be required to pay the Parent Fee or the Maximum Amount if the Financing would not have been available as a result of the failure of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the penultimate sentence of _Section 4.5(a)_ to be true and correct in all material respects; 

   

 (ii) the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, then (x) Parent shall pay to the Company the Parent Fee, if none of Investor, Parent or Sub is in willful breach of its covenants or agreements in this Agreement, and (y) Parent shall pay the Maximum Amount, if any of Investor, Parent or Sub is in willful breach of its covenants or other agreements in this Agreement; _provided_  that Parent shall not be required to pay any such amount if the Financing would not have been available as a result of the failure of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the penultimate sentence of _Section 4.5(a)_ to be true and correct in all material respects.

 (d) If Parent has extended the Termination Date pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ and this Agreement is terminated by: 

   

 (i) the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ and, at such time, (x) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by deliveries at the Closing), other than the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ and _Section 7.1(c)_ due to the failure to receive any required consent or clearance under Antitrust Laws from a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction or any action by any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction to prevent the Merger for antitrust reasons and (y) the failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(c)_ to be satisfied was not due to any requirement by any Governmental Entity as a condition to its approval of the transactions contemplated hereby that Parent or Sub agree to any divestiture or restriction that would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a material adverse effect on the combined business of Parent and the Surviving Corporation at or after the Effective Time, then Parent shall pay to the Company the Maximum Amount; or 

   

 (ii) the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, then Parent shall pay to the Company the Maximum Amount; _provided_ that Parent shall not be required to pay any such amount if the Financing would not have been available as a result of the failure of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the penultimate sentence of _Section 4.5(a)_ to be true and correct in all material respects. 

  

 (e) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by (A) the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ and at such time all the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.3_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by deliveries at the Closing or are not satisfied due to a willful breach by the Company of any of its covenants or other agreements in this Agreement), (B) Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ or (C) Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or, absent a breach of any covenant or other agreement in this Agreement by the Company (provided that if any such breach occurred prior to the date of termination, that Parent notified the Company in writing of such breach as soon as reasonably practicable after Parent became aware of such breach) or absent a failure of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the penultimate sentence of _Section 4.5(a)_ to be true and correct in all material respects, would be available at the Closing and (iii) the Company has willfully breached any of its covenants or other agreements in this Agreement, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Maximum Amount, less the amount of any Termination Payment previously paid to Parent by the Company. 

  

 (f) Except as otherwise specified in this Section 8.2, any required payment of the Termination Payment, the Parent Fee or the Maximum Amount 

   ##### 

  

 

shall be made as promptly as reasonably practicable, and, in any event, within
two (2) Business Days, following the applicable termination. 

   

 (g) All payments contemplated by this _Section 8.2_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the applicable party and shall be reduced by any amounts required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Law in respect of Taxes. The parties hereto agree that in no event shall (i) the Company be required to pay the Termination Payment (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be credited against any payment of the Maximum Amount that may be required to be paid by the Company) or the Maximum Amount on more than on occasion and (ii) Parent be required to pay the Parent Fee (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be credited against any payment of the Maximum Amount that may be required to be paid by Parent) or the Maximum Amount on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if Parent provides the Company with an IRS Form W-8BEN prior to the payment of any payment contemplated by this _Section 8.2_ claiming that such payment is not subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax under the Convention Between the United States of America and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, then (i) the Company shall not (absent a change in Law) withhold any U.S. federal withholding Tax from the payment of any such payment and (ii) Parent shall indemnify the Company for (and hold it harmless against) the full amount of any losses of the Company or any Affiliate arising from an assertion by any Governmental Entity that such payment was subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax, including, but not limited to, any such U.S. federal withholding Tax, any interest or penalties related thereto, any Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this _Section 8.2(g)_ and any reasonable third-party expenses incurred by the Company in connection with an assertion by any Governmental Entity, that such payment was subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax whether or not any such were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Entity. At the Companys option, (i) Parent shall control the portion of any audit or other proceeding that may give rise to an indemnity payment pursuant to this  _Section 8.2(g)_ or (ii) the Company shall control such portion of any audit or other proceeding and shall permit Parent to fully participate in such portion. Neither Parent nor the Company shall settle the portion of any audit or other proceeding that may give rise to an indemnity payment pursuant to this _Section 8.2(g)_ without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each party shall promptly inform the other party upon receipt of any claim from any Governmental Entity that could reasonably be expected to give rise to an indemnity claim pursuant to this _Section 8.2(g)_. 

  

 (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) in the event Investor, Parent and Sub fail to effect the Closing or otherwise breach this Agreement or fail to perform hereunder, then, except for an order of specific performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted by _Section 9.11_, the Companys sole and exclusive remedy against Investor, Parent, Sub, or any of their respective Covered Persons in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith, including, without limitation, the Financing Commitments, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be to terminate this Agreement in 

   ##### 

  

 

accordance with _Section 8.1_ and collect any amounts due pursuant to
_Section 8.2(c)_ or _(d)_ , and upon payment of any such amounts, none of
Investor, Parent, Sub or any of their respective Covered Persons shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) in the event
the Company fails to effect the Closing or otherwise breaches this Agreement
or fails to perform hereunder, then, except for an order of specific
performance as contemplated by _Section 9.11_ , Investors, Parents and
Subs sole and exclusive remedy against the Company or any of its Covered
Persons in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection
herewith, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_ and collect any
amounts due pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.2(e)_, and upon
payment of any such amounts, none of the Company nor any of its Covered
Persons shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby 

   

 (i) In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Payment or the Maximum Amount when due, or Parent shall fail to pay the Parent Fee or the Maximum Amount when due, the Company shall reimburse Parent, or Parent shall reimburse the Company, as the case may be, for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by the Company or Parent (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel), as the case may be, in connection with any Action (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid to the date of actual payment.

 Section 9.8 _Governing Law_.

   ##### 

  

 

LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH
PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT, THE FINANCING COMMITMENTS OR THE FINANCING. EACH PARTY

ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATION OF
THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party by any other legally available method. 

   

 Section 9.11 _Specific Performance; Limitation on Liability_. 

   

 (a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of any breach of this Agreement, each nonbreaching party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at Law or in equity, to compel specific performance of this Agreement in any Action instituted in accordance with  _Section 9.9_. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including _Section 9.11(a)_ , it is agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of  _Section 6.9(g)_ and Parents obligation to cause the Affiliate Financing to be funded to fund the Merger and to consummate the Merger only in the event that (i) Parent and Sub are required to complete the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.3_, (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Affiliate Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) Parent and Sub fail to complete the Closing in accordance with _Section 2.3_. The Company shall not be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically _Section 6.9(g)_ or Parents obligations to cause the Affiliate Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Affiliate Financing is funded at the Closing). Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or 

   ##### 

  

 

equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with
any such order or injunction. If a court of competent jurisdiction has
declined to specifically enforce  _Section 6.9(g)_ and the obligations of
Parent and Sub to consummate the Merger pursuant to a claim for specific
performance brought against Investor, Parent and Sub pursuant to this 
_Section 9.11(b)_, the Company shall be entitled to the Parent Fee or the
Maximum Amount, as applicable, to the extent it is entitled to such amount
under the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including Section 9.11(a), except as provided in _Section 9.11(b)_, the parties acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Investor, Parent or Sub or any remedy to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and that the Companys sole and exclusive remedies with respect to any such breach shall be the remedies set forth in _Section 8.2_; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) this  _Section 9.11_ does not limit the remedies available to the Indemnified Parties under  _Section 9.6_ and (ii) the Company shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent any breach by Parent or Sub of (A) the last two sentences of _Section 6.2_ and (B)  _Section 6.5_. 

  

 (d) Other than as provided in clause (i) of the second sentence of _Section 9.6_ and this _Section 9.11_, neither the Company nor any of its Covered Persons shall have any liability to Investor, Parent, Sub or any of their respective Covered Persons under or in respect of this Agreement or any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions related hereto under any theory other than payment by the Company of the Termination Payment and/or the Maximum Amount (subject to the crediting described in _Section 8.2(g)_) under the terms of  _Section 8.2_, if applicable, and any reimbursements payable by the Company pursuant to  _Section 8.2(i)_. 

  

 (e) Other than as provided in clause (i) of the second sentence of _Section 9.6_ or as required to comply with an order of specific performance granted in accordance with this  _Section 9.11_, none of Investor, Parent, Sub and any of their respective Covered Persons shall have any liability to the Company or any of its Covered Persons under or in respect of this Agreement or any agreement executed in connection herewith, including the Financing Commitments, or the transactions related hereto or thereto under any theory other than payment by Parent of the Parent Fee and/or the Maximum Amount (subject to the crediting described in _Section 8.2(g)_) under the terms of _Section 8.2_, if applicable, and any reimbursements payable by Parent pursuant to _Section 6.9(e)_, _Section 6.13(c)_ or _Section 8.2(i)_. 

  

 Section 9.12 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Parent and/or Sub may assign all or any of their rights and obligations hereunder as collateral to any Financing Source or to any Affiliate of Parent after 

      ##### 

  

    

providing written notice thereof to the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective permitted successors and assigns. 

   

 Section 9.13 _Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated hereby is consummated. 

   

 Section 9.14 _Headings_. Headings of the articles and sections of this Agreement and the table of contents, schedules and exhibits are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive or interpretative effect whatsoever. 

   

 Section 9.15 _Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party expressly granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. 

    ##### 

  

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company, Investor, Parent and Sub have caused this Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the date first written above.
