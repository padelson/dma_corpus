("Parent"), AIP/FIC Merger Sub, Inc., a Washington corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Flow International Corporation,

W I T N E S S E T H:

  

  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of the Company (the "Company Board"),

with and into the Company with the Company continuing as the surviving
corporation in the merger (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  

  

WHEREAS, the Company Board has (a) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable and fair
to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders, (b)
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (c) directed that the adoption

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the parties hereto (intending to be legally bound) hereby agree
as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

Section 1.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Washington Business
Corporation Act (the "WBCA"), at the Effective Time Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
WBCA and, following the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall succeed to
and assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with the
WBCA.

  

  

Section 1.02 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at 10:00 a.m. on the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), at the offices of KandL Gates LLP,
925 Fourth Avenue, Seattle, Washington, or such other time, date or place
agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company; provided, however that the
parties shall not be required to effect the Closing until the earlier of (i) a
Business Day before or during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on no
less than (3) three Business Days notice to the Company and (ii) the third
Business Day immediately following the final day of the Marketing Period. The
date on which the Closing occurs is referred to as the "Closing Date".

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-1-  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 1.03 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Washington articles of merger
(the "Articles of Merger"), together with any required related certificates,
filings and recordings, in such form as required by, and executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of, the WBCA. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Washington, or at such later time as Parent and the
Company may agree in writing and specify in the Articles of Merger (the time
the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

  

  

Section 1.04 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective Time,
subject to Section 6.06, (a) the Articles of Incorporation of the Company
shall be amended in their entirety such that the Surviving Corporation's
Articles of Incorporation shall be substantially identical (except with
respect to the name of the Company) to the Articles of Incorporation of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, and (b) the Bylaws of the
Company shall be amended and restated in their entirety such that the
Surviving Corporation's Bylaws shall be substantially identical (except with
respect to the name of the Company) to the Bylaws of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective time until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law.

  

  

Section 1.05 Directors and Officers. The parties shall take all necessary
actions such that from and after the Effective Time, (a) the directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be, and (b) the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

  

EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

  

Section 2.01 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (together with the
associated Rights (as defined in the Rights Agreement), the "Company Common
Stock"), or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub or any other
Person:

  

  

(a) Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive $4.05 in cash, without interest (the
"Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of (i) a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") and (ii) any such shares of Company
Common Stock represented by book-entry (the "Book-Entry Shares") shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in
accordance with Section 2.02(b).

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Stock Owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub. Each
share of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-2-  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

  

 

  

Section 2.02 Exchange of Shares for Merger Consideration.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or
trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying
agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with (i) the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.01(a), and (ii)
the Surviving Corporation cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
cash payments required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.03(a) and Section
2.03(b)(ii). All cash deposited with the Paying Agent and the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) shall hereinafter be referred to
as the "Merger Fund".

  

  

(b) Exchange and Payment Procedures.

  

  

(i) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more
than three Business Days following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of Company Common Stock (A) a
letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form approved by the
Company prior to the Effective Time and shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent) and (B) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for the Merger Consideration.

  

  

(ii) Upon (A) surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates for cancellation,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
be required pursuant to such instructions or (B) compliance with the
reasonable procedures established by the Paying Agent for delivery of Book-
Entry Shares, each holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, in cash, the aggregate Merger
Consideration in respect thereof in the form of a check to be mailed within
three Business Days of receipt by the Paying Agent of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, and the Certificates so surrendered and Book-Entry Shares
so transferred shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or due
transfer of the Book-Entry Shares. The Paying Agent shall accept such
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices.

  

  

(iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of the applicable Company Common Stock may be made to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificates so surrendered
or the Book-Entry Shares so transferred are registered if such Certificates
are properly endorsed or otherwise are in proper form for transfer or such
Book-Entry Shares are properly transferred and, in each case, the Person
requesting such payment pays any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect thereof or establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable.

  

  

(c) Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding 
 

 

 

 

  

 

-3-  

  

 

 

 

 

  

immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Surviving Corporation for
transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration as
provided in this Section 2.02.

  

  

(d) Termination of the Merger Fund. Any portion of the Merger Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
and other eligible Persons in accordance with this Article II for 12 months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation,
upon demand, and any such holders or Persons who have not theretofore complied
with this Section 2.02 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration in accordance with
this Article II.

  

  

(e) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.

  

  

(f) Investment of Merger Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash included
in the Merger Fund in (i) short-term obligations of the United States of
America or (ii) short-term obligations backed by the full faith and credit of
the United States of America, in each case pending payment by the Paying
Agent in accordance with this Article II. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be income of Parent. If
for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Merger Fund is insufficient
to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the
Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Merger
Fund in an amount that is equal to such deficiency. The Merger Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose except as provided in this Agreement.

  

  

(g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the delivery of a bond in such a sum as Parent
may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.02.

  

  

(h) Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall each be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration or
any other consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to holders of
Company Common Stock, Dissenting Shares, Company Stock Options and Restricted
Stock Rights such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

  

  

(i) No Other Rights. Until surrendered or transferred, as applicable, in
accordance with this Section 2.02, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration. Any Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender of any Certificate or the transfer of any Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and the Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby.

Section 2.03 Stock Options and Restricted Stock Rights.

  

  

(a) Company Stock Options. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
any other Person, each option to purchase Company Common Stock issued by the
Company pursuant to the Incentive Plan (each, a "Company Stock
Option"), whether vested or unvested, shall be fully vested and shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without
interest and less any applicable taxes required to be withheld in accordance
with Section 2.02(h) with respect to such payment) equal to (i) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share
of such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to each such Company Stock Option.

  

  

(b) Restricted Stock Rights.

  


 

  

(i) Performance-Based Awards. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or any other Person, each outstanding restricted stock right, phantom share
right or restricted stock unit issued by the Company pursuant to the Incentive
Plan that is subject to performance-based vesting conditions that have not, as
of the Effective Time, been satisfied shall be canceled and no consideration
shall be payable with respect thereto.

  

  

(ii) Time-Based Awards. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
any other Person, each restricted stock right, restricted stock unit or
phantom share right issued by the Company pursuant to the Incentive Plan that
is subject to time-based vesting conditions, whether vested or unvested (each,
a "Restricted Stock Right"), shall be fully vested and free of any forfeiture
restrictions and shall be canceled, with the holder of each such Restricted
Stock Right becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest
and less any applicable taxes required to be withheld in accordance with
Section 2.02(h) with respect to such payment) equal to (A) the Merger
Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to each such Restricted Stock Right.

  

  

(c) Payment. Unless a later time for payment is otherwise agreed between
Parent and an individual holder, the Surviving Corporation shall pay the
holders of Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock Rights the cash payments
described in this Section 2.03 promptly after the Effective Time, but in any
event not later than the third Business Day after the Effective Time. As of
the Effective Time, each holder of any Company Stock Option and each holder of
any Restricted Stock Right shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, other than as expressly provided in this Section 2.03.

  

  

(d) Company Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary (including obtaining any necessary resolutions or
determinations of the Company Board or any committee thereof and any consents
or cancellation agreements which may be required from any other Persons) to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.03 and to terminate all of the
then-outstanding Company Stock Options and all of the Company's then-
outstanding equity award plans (including the Incentive Plan).

thereof (a) has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing, (b) has demanded its rights to be paid the fair value of such Company
Common Stock in accordance with Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA (the "Appraisal
Rights") and (c) has not effectively withdrawn or lost its rights to be paid
the fair value of such Company Common Stock (each, a "Dissenting Share"), if
any, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as provided in Section 2.01(a), but rather, the holders of Dissenting Shares
shall be entitled

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-5-  

  

 

 

 

  

only to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA (and, at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and such holders shall cease to have any right with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA); provided, that if any such
holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to dissent or its dissenters' rights under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA,
then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's
Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become
exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(without interest thereon) as provided in Section 2.01(a). The Company shall
notify Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable of any written demands
received by the Company for payment of the fair value of any Company Common
Stock and shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in and,
together with the Company, jointly control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, except as required
by applicable Law, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

Section 2.05 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. If between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock are changed into a different number of shares or a different class due
to any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, then in any such case
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such
action.

Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

  

  

Section 4.01 Organization, Standing and Power. Parent is a corporation, duly

the requisite entity power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as currently being conducted, and is
duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing (as
applicable), in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification,
licensing or good standing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified, licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available to
the Company true, complete and accurate copies of the organizational documents
of each of Parent and Merger Sub, in each case as amended to, and as in effect
on, the date of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 4.02 Authority; Noncontravention.

action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub and no other proceedings on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
do not require approval of the holders of any shares of capital stock of
Parent. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of each of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, enforceable against each of

enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or
other similar Laws

not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result
in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any of the properties
or other assets of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries under (i) the respective organizational and governing documents
of Parent and Merger Sub or of any of their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) any

referred to in Section 4.02(c), any Law or Order applicable to Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or their respective

and 4.02(b)(iii), any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights
of termination, cancellation or acceleration, losses or Liens that
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

  

  

(c) No consent, approval, Order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required for the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except for (i) the filing of a premerger
notification and report form by Parent under the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Laws and the termination or expiration of the waiting period
required thereunder, (ii) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the
Secretary of State of Washington, and (iii) such other consents, approvals,
Orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings the failure of
which to be obtained or made would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 4.03 Merger Sub Operations and Capitalization. Merger Sub has been
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated
hereby and, prior to the Effective Time, has not engaged in any other business
activities and has not incurred any liabilities or obligations other than as

All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the
Effective Time shall be, owned by Parent.

  

  

Section 4.04 Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement shall, at the date it is first mailed to the shareholders of the
Company and at the time of the Shareholders' Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

  

  

Section 4.05 Financing; Availability of Funds.

   
 

(a) Parent has provided to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of
(i) the commitment letter, dated as of September 25, 2013 (such commitment
letter, together with all exhibits, schedules and annexes and amendments
thereto, the "Equity Commitment Letter"), by and among Parent, Merger Sub and
American Industrial Partners Capital Fund IV, L.P. and American Industrial
Partners Capital Fund V, L.P. (each a "Sponsor" and collectively, the
"Sponsors"), pursuant to which the Sponsors have committed, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, to invest the cash amount set forth therein (the
"Equity Financing"), (ii) the commitment letter, dated September 25, 2013,
among Parent,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-22-  

  

 

 

 

  

Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (such
commitment letter, together with all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto
and the fee letters associated therewith, the "Bank Commitment Letter" and
together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the "Commitment Letters") pursuant
to which the Financing Sources party thereto have committed, on the terms and
conditions thereof, to lend the debt amounts set forth therein (the "Bank
Financing" and together with the Equity Financing, the "Financing"); and (iii)
the fee letters, each dated September 25, 2013, that are referred to in the
Bank Commitment Letter (the "Fee Letters"), provided, that the terms of the
Fee Letters relating to fees and "flex" have been redacted (but such
redactions do not relate to any terms that would impact the availability,
conditionality or amount of the Bank Financing, except to the extent a
reduction in the principal amount of the Bank Financing would be offset by an
increase in the debt financing or other funding being made available by the
Financing Sources). As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters,
including the financing commitments contained therein, (x) have not been
amended, restated, withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified or waived, and
no such amendment, restatement, withdrawal, rescission or other modification
or waiver of the Commitment Letters is contemplated, and (y) are in full force
and effect, and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of each of
Parent and Merger Sub (in the case of the Equity Commitment Letter) and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, except that such
enforceability (A) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or
other similar Laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and (B) is subject to general principles of equity.

  

  

(b) There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated by the
Commitment Letters and the Fee Letters. Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid
any and all commitment fees or other fees or deposits required by the
Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. As of
the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other
parties thereto, under the Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, assuming
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII Parent has no reason
to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters will not be satisfied or that sufficient funds to fund the
Merger Fund and to pay all expenses and all other amounts required to be paid
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to their payment obligations hereunder will not be made
available to Parent and Merger Sub on the Closing Date.

  

  

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other
agreements, contracts, understandings or arrangements to which Parent or any
of its Affiliates is a party related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Financing other than as expressly set
forth in the Commitment Letters, the Fee Letters and any side letters or other
agreements, contracts, understandings or arrangements that do not impact
the availability, conditionality or amount of the Financing.

  

  

(d) Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the Commitment
Letters, the net proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letters, together
with cash or cash equivalents held by Parent and Merger Sub, will in the
aggregate be sufficient for Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration (and any repayment or refinancing of debt
contemplated by this Agreement or the Commitment Letters) and any other
amounts required to be paid by Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to pay all related expenses at the Closing required to be paid
by Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

Section 4.06 Brokers. No Person other than Houlihan Lokey, Inc. is entitled to
any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or similar fee or commission in
connection with the transactions

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-23-  

  

 

 

 

  

contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

  

  

Section 4.07 Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement (a) there is no
suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether at law or in equity, before
or by any Governmental Entity or before any arbitrator) pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened against or affecting Parent or any of its
Affiliates, the outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, would
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and (b) there is no Order of any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Parent or any of its
Affiliates which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 4.08 Ownership of Company Common Stock. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub,
nor any of their respective Affiliates, owns (beneficially or of record) any
Company Common Stock or any option, warrant or other right to acquire any
Company Common Stock. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is, and at no time during
the last five years has been, an "acquiring person" of the Company, as such
quoted term is defined in Section 23B.19.020 of the WBCA.

  

  

Section 4.09 Absences of Certain Arrangements. There are no contracts or other
agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) or
commitments to enter into contracts, agreements, arrangements or
understandings (whether oral or written) (a) between Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Company's
management or the Company Board, on the other hand, as of the date hereof that
relate in any way to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
transactions contemplated hereby or (b) pursuant to which any shareholder of
the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount
or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any shareholder
of the Company agrees to vote to approve this Agreement or the Merger or
agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal.

  

  

Section 4.10 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, neither Parent,
Merger Sub nor any other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any
other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or
Merger Sub or with respect to any other information provided by or on behalf
of Parent or Merger Sub.

  

  

Section 4.11 Additional Acknowledgements by Parent and Merger Sub. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that, other than with respect to access to
information that is competitive in nature as it relates to the Company's
business, as of the date of this Agreement, they and their Representatives (a)
have received full access to (i) such books and records, facilities,
properties, premises, equipment, contracts and other assets of the Company and
the Company's Subsidiaries which they and their Representatives, as of the
date hereof, have requested to review and (ii) the Electronic Data Room and
(b) have had full opportunity to meet with the management of the Company and
the Company's Subsidiaries and to discuss the business and assets of the
Company and the Company's Subsidiaries. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge

forth in Article III or in any certificate delivered by the Company pursuant
to this Agreement, (A) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes,

no Person has been authorized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to

warranty must not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub as having been
authorized by such entity, and (C) any estimate, projection, prediction, data,
financial information, memorandum, presentation or any other materials or
information provided or addressed to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Representatives, including any materials or information made available in the

management or otherwise, are not and shall not be deemed to be or include

information is the subject of any express representation or warranty set forth
in Article III or in any certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to this
Agreement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has conducted, to its satisfaction,
its own independent review and analysis of the businesses, assets, condition,
operations and prospects of the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries and, in
making its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger, each of Parent and Merger Sub has relied
on the results of its own independent review and analysis.

permitted by this Section 5.02, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and
the Company shall instruct and cause its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives

terminated, the Company shall instruct such Person (or group) to promptly
return or destroy in accordance with the terms of the applicable

Electronic Data Room) to no longer be accessible to or by any such Person (or
group) other than Parent and Merger Sub and their Affiliates and
Representatives.

  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the

Acquisition Proposal (other than as a result of a material breach of Section
5.02(a)), the Company and the Company Board may (directly or through their
Representatives) (A) contact and engage in discussions with the Person
(or group) making the proposal and its Representatives solely for the purpose
of clarifying the proposal and any material terms and conditions thereof and
the likelihood of consummation thereof, so as to determine whether such
proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal
and (B) if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board
under applicable Law and, taking into account all factual and legal factors
affecting certainty of closing), that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (1) furnish information
with respect to the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries to such Person (or
group) and its Representatives pursuant to an executed confidentiality
agreement with confidentiality, standstill and other provisions no less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the

provided that the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in
any event within 48 hours) provide to Parent (x) a copy of all such material
nonpublic information not previously provided to Parent (or its
Representatives), and (y) a copy of such written Acquisition Proposal
(including copies of any related documents including debt and equity financing
commitment letters) provided to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company,
including a written summary of any material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal not made in writing and the identity of the Person (or group) making
the Acquisition Proposal and (2) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person (or group) making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

(iii) Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status of any Acquisition Proposal, including any
significant changes, developments, discussions or negotiations with respect
thereto, on a current basis (and in any event within 48 hours of the receipt
thereof and any significant changes, developments, discussions or negotiations
with respect thereto). The Company agrees that neither it nor any Company
Subsidiary will enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing any
information to Parent in accordance with this Section 5.02. From and after the
date hereof, the Company shall not grant any waiver, amendment or release
under any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement or other standstill agreement
without the prior written consent of Parent (it being understood that the
Company shall have no obligation to seek to modify any such agreement that by
its terms becomes inoperative in accordance with the terms of such agreement
as in effect on the date of this Agreement).

(A)(1) withdraw (or qualify, withhold, amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent) or publicly propose to withdraw (or qualify, withhold, amend or modify
in a manner adverse to Parent), the Company Board Recommendation, (2) fail to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (3) fail to
recommend against any Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the
Exchange Act in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such Acquisition
Proposal,; provided that Parent may not make such request more than once in
any thirty (30) day period, or (4) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose
publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in this clause (A) being referred to as a "Change in
Recommendation"; provided, that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Company Board to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act shall not constitute a Change in
Recommendation) or (B) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement, arrangement or understanding (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) (x) constituting or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal or (y) requiring it to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that, in the case of this clause
(B), the Company shall not be prohibited from entering into an agreement if
it concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g).

  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, but subject to the Company's compliance in all material respects
with the other provisions of this Section 5.02, as applicable, at any time
prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may:

  

  

(A) make a Change in Recommendation if there exists any (one or more than one)
material event, development, occurrence, or change in circumstance or facts
not related to an Acquisition Proposal that was not known by the Company Board
as of the date of this Agreement and, as a result thereof, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside
counsel and its independent financial advisor, that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law (an "Intervening
Event Change in Recommendation"); provided, that, (x) the Company shall
provide Parent with no less than three Business Days' advance notice of any
Intervening Event Change in Recommendation, and (y) if and for so long as
Parent requests, during such three Business Day period the Company and its
legal counsel and independent financial advisor shall negotiate in good faith
with Parent regarding any revisions to the terms of the Merger proposed by
Parent, the purpose of which is to render the Intervening Event Change in
Recommendation unnecessary; and

  

  

(B) (1) make a Change in Recommendation related to an Acquisition Proposal, if
the Company Board determines, after consultation with the Company's outside
counsel and its independent financial advisor, (AA) taking into account all
factual, legal, regulatory and financial aspects of the proposal and the
Person (or group) making the proposal (including factors affecting certainty
of closing), in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is, or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (BB) that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law (a "Superior Proposal Change in Recommendation") or (2)
in response to a Superior Proposal, resolve to accept such Superior Proposal
and cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g);
provided, that concurrently with such termination,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-29-  

  

 

 

 

  

the Company pays the fees required by Section 8.02; provided, further, that
(a) no Superior Proposal Change in Recommendation pursuant to this Section
5.02(b) may be made and (b) no valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(g) may be made, unless (w) the Company Board has first provided
three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to
make a Superior Proposal Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(g) in response to a Superior Proposal (a "Superior
Proposal Notice"), which notice shall contain a description of the material
terms and conditions (including the identity of the Person (or group) making
such Superior Proposal) of such Superior Proposal and the financing therefor
(it being understood and agreed that the delivery of such notice shall not, in
and of itself, be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation), and the Company
has contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed definitive
transaction agreements with the Person making such Superior Proposal and all
related debt and equity financing commitment letters, (x) the Company has
negotiated, and has caused the Company Representatives to negotiate in good
faith with Parent during such notice period, to enable Parent to propose
changes to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Financing such
that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal, (y) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall
have considered in good faith any revisions to this Agreement and the
Financing proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have in good faith
determined, following consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
independent financial advisor, that the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given effect, and
(z) in the event of any material change to the material terms of such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent
an additional notice and the three (3) Business Day notice period shall have
recommenced (and the Company shall have again complied with the requirements
of this Section 5.02(b)(ii)(B) during such period), unless the event requiring
notice pursuant to this Section 5.02(b) occurred less than three (3) Business
Days prior to the Shareholders' Meeting, in which case the Company shall
deliver notice to Parent of such event as promptly as practicable.

  

  

(c) Permitted Actions. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the
Company a position contemplated by, or otherwise complying with, Rule 14d-9,
14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, if
in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, failure to so take or
disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders
of the Company under applicable Law or (ii) complying with its disclosure
obligations with regard to any Acquisition Proposal under applicable Law.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

  

Section 6.01 Preparation of the Proxy Statement.

  

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, the Company
shall, with the assistance of Parent, prepare, and the Company shall file with
the SEC, a proxy statement relating to the approval of this Agreement by the
shareholders of the Company (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the
"Proxy Statement"). Parent and the Company shall cooperate with one another
in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement and shall furnish
all information concerning such party as the other party may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Parent and
the Company shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy
Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after such
filing. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of the Company as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-30-  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable
notify the other of (i) the receipt of any comments from the SEC and all other
written correspondence and oral communications with the SEC relating to the
Proxy Statement and (ii) any request by the SEC for any amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement or for additional information with respect
thereto. All filings by the Company with the SEC in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto, shall be subject to the reasonable prior
review and comment of Parent and comply as to form in all material respects
with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and all mailings to the shareholders and other holders
of Company Securities in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the reasonable prior review
and comment of Parent; provided, that the Company shall no longer be required
to comply with the foregoing if the Company Board has effected any Change in
Recommendation or has resolved to do so. All filings by Parent with the SEC in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to the
reasonable prior review and comment of the Company. Each of the Company and
Parent shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made
by the other or its counsel.

  

  

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, is discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.

  


 

  

Section 6.02 Shareholders' Meeting. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to, as reasonably as practicable following the date on which the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC, take all actions in accordance with
applicable Law, the Company Articles, Company Bylaws and the rules of the
NASDAQ to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its shareholders (including any adjournment thereof) (the
"Shareholders' Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder
Approval; provided, that if the Company Board effects a Change in
Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.02(b), the Company may cease to
use such efforts. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company may postpone or
adjourn the Shareholders' Meeting for the absence of a quorum; or if
necessary, to solicit additional proxies in the event that there are
not sufficient votes at the time of the Shareholders' Meeting to obtain
Shareholder Approval. Subject to Section 5.02, the Company shall, through the
Company Board, recommend to its shareholders approval of this Agreement and
the Merger and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
Subject to the foregoing and Section 5.02, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Shareholder Approval.

  

  

Section 6.03 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

   
 

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall afford to
Parent, and to Parent's Representatives, reasonable access during normal
business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company during the
period prior to the Effective Time to all of the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' properties, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and
records, and, during such period, the Company shall furnish promptly
to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
Federal or state securities Laws and (ii) all other information concerning its
and its Subsidiaries' business, properties and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-31-  

  

 

 

 

  

personnel as Parent may reasonably request; provided, that such access and
inspections shall not unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries; and provided further, that the Company shall not be required
to (or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to) so confer, afford such access or
furnish such copies or other information to the extent that doing so may
result in a violation of Law, result in the loss of attorney-client privilege
or violate confidentiality obligations owing to third parties (it being agreed
that the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is
withholding such information or documents pursuant to the foregoing provisos,
and, thereafter, the Company and Parent shall, to the fullest extent possible,
reasonably cooperate to cause such information to be provided in a manner that
would not reasonably be expected to waive the applicable privilege or
protection or violate the applicable legal or contractual restriction).
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give to Parent or its Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company\'s or its
Subsidiaries\' operations prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the
nondisclosure agreement between Parent and the Company dated June 21, 2013
(the "Confidentiality Agreement"), (i) Parent shall hold, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives to hold,
all information received from the Company, directly or indirectly, in
confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) the
Company shall hold, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives to hold, all information received from Parent, directly or
indirectly, in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.
The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.04 Appropriate Actions; Consents; Filings.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, in the case of the
Company, consistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board with the
advice of the Company\'s outside counsel, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary to consummate and
make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable
efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to
cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable;
(ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,
clearances, and approvals from Governmental Entities and non-governmental
third parties and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Entities); and (iii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties. In connection
with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall file as
promptly as practicable with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC")
and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the "Antitrust
Division") the notification and report form (the "HSR Filing") required under
the HSR Act with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated
to use its reasonable efforts or take any action pursuant to this Section
6.04 if, there shall have been a Change in Recommendation. The HSR Filing
shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the Laws, as
applicable. Subject to first having used all reasonable efforts to negotiate a
resolution of any objections underlying such lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, Company and Parent shall defend and contest any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay, temporary
restraining order, or preliminary injunction entered by any Governmental
Entity vacated or reversed.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-32-  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate and consult with each other in
connection with the making of all filings, notifications and any other
material actions pursuant to this Section 6.04, subject to applicable Law, by
permitting counsel for the other party to review in advance, and consider in
good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed
material written communication to any Governmental Entity and by providing
counsel for the other party with copies of all filings and submissions made by
such party and all correspondence between such party (and its advisors) with
any Governmental Entity and any other information supplied by such party and
such party's Affiliates to a Governmental Entity or received from such a
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that material may be redacted (i) as necessary
to comply with contractual arrangements, and (ii) as necessary to address good
faith legal privilege or confidentiality concerns. Neither party shall file
any such document or take such action if the other party has reasonably
objected (and not withdrawn its objection) to the filing of such document or
the taking of such action on the grounds that such filing or action would
reasonably be expected to either (A) prevent, materially delay or materially
impede the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby or (B) cause a condition set forth in Article VII to not be satisfied
in a timely manner. Neither party shall consent to any voluntary extension of
any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest
of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the other party.

  

  

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly inform the other party upon
receipt of any material communication from any Governmental Entity regarding
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the Company or
Parent (or any of their respective Affiliates) receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental
Entity that is related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
then such party shall endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as
soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. The parties agree not to
participate, or to permit their Affiliates to participate, in any substantive
meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it so consults with the
other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate. Each
party shall advise the other party promptly of any understandings,
undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which the first party proposes to
make or enter into with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party shall use all reasonable efforts to
resolve any objections that may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulatory Laws, including (subject to first having used all reasonable
efforts to negotiate a resolution to any such objections) contesting and
resisting any action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in
effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to have such Law or
Order repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of this Section
6.04, Company and Parent agree to use their reasonable efforts to take any and
all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
antitrust, competition or trade Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity or any other party so as to enable the parties hereto to close
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall be required to, nor shall the Company (without the consent of
Parent, which may be withheld in Parent's sole discretion), negotiate, commit
to or effect by Order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of
any of its assets, properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or
businesses to be acquired by it pursuant hereto or enter into any Order,
accept any

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-33-  

  

 

 

 

  

undertaking or condition or otherwise take or commit to take actions that
would limit Parent's, the Company's or their respective Affiliates' freedom of
action with respect to, or ability to exclusively retain, any of their
businesses, product lines, technologies or assets, or otherwise limit Parent's
or its Affiliates' ability to receive the full benefits of this Agreement. In
no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to (nor will the Company,
without Parent's consent, which may be withheld at Parent's reasonable
discretion) pay any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party for
any consent or approval required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Contract. In addition, Parent shall
use its reasonable efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
that would prevent the consummation of the Closing.

  

  

(e) The Company and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by Law, promptly
provide the other with copies of all filings made by such party with any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than the portions of such filings that
include confidential or proprietary information not directly related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.05 State Takeover Laws. If any "fair price," "business combination"
or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar Law is or may become
applicable to the Merger, the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to (a)
take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions
contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise take all such actions as are
reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such Law on
the Merger.

  

  

Section 6.06 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

  

  

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee or consultant may have under any employment or
indemnification agreement or under the Company Articles or Company Bylaws,
this Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or
agreements of any of the Company's Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each Person who was, is at the date of this Agreement or becomes
during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date (A)
a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) a
director, officer or trustee of another entity (but only to the extent that
such Person is or was serving in such capacity at the request of the Company)
or (C) an employee or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"), in each case, to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by applicable Law without regard to whether
indemnification may be available to such Indemnified Party from another
Person, as now or hereafter in effect, with respect to any claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, fees, costs and
expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, and amounts paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect thereof), incurred in connection with
any claim, action, suit, inquiry, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
administrative or investigative, to which such Indemnified Party is or was
made a party to or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise
involved by reason of the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was serving
in one of the capacities set forth in (A)-(C) above and (ii) promptly pay on
behalf of or, within 10 Business Days after any request for advancement,
advance to, each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized
or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, any expenses
incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise
participating in any such matter in advance of the final disposition of such
matter, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party
of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification or advancement, in
each case, without the requirement of any bond or other security, provided
that the individual to whom expenses are

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-34-  

  

 

 

 

  

advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it shall be
determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this
Section 6.06(a). The indemnification and advancement obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section 6.06 shall extend to acts
or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation relating thereto (including with respect to
any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval and adoption
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the consideration, approval and adoption thereof and the
process undertaken in connection therewith and any claim relating thereto),
and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall
continue as to a Person who continues to be or who has ceased to be (1) a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (2) a director,
officer or trustee of another entity (but only to the extent that such Person
is or was serving in such capacity at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) or (3) an employee or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in respect
of which indemnification has been or could be sought by such Indemnified
Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such claim and does not include an admission of fault or wrongdoing by any
Indemnified Party, or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

  

  

(b) Parent shall cause the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitation of director,
officer and employee liability that are no less favorable to the Indemnified
Parties than those set forth in the Company Articles and Company Bylaws and
the organizational documents of the Company's Subsidiaries as of the date of
this Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any Indemnified Parties.

  

  

(c) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior
to the Effective Time, a single payment, run-off policy or policies of
directors' and officers', employed lawyers' and fiduciary liability insurance
covering the Persons currently covered by the Company's existing directors'
and officers', employed lawyers' and/or fiduciary liability insurance policies
for claims arising in respect of actual or alleged errors, misstatements,
acts, omissions or any matter claimed against any such Person occurring prior
to the Effective Time, including in connection with the approval of the
Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
amount and scope no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the Company's
existing policies, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to such
insurance, such policy or policies to become effective at the Effective Time
and remain in effect for a period of six years following the Effective Time
(such policy or policies collectively referred to as the "Tail Policy");
provided, however, that the premium for such Tail Policy shall not exceed
300% of the aggregate annual amounts currently paid by the Company to maintain
its existing directors' and officers', employed lawyers' and fiduciary
liability insurance policies. If the Company is unable to obtain such Tail
Policy in accordance with the foregoing, Parent shall obtain, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to obtain, such run-off policy or policies from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier with respect to such insurance (such policy or
policies, collectively, a "Parent Substitute Policy"); provided, further,
however, that the premium for such Parent Substitute Policy shall not exceed
300% of the aggregate annual amounts currently paid by the Company to maintain
its existing directors' and officers', employed lawyers' and fiduciary
liability insurance policies provided, further, that, if such Tail Policy or
Parent Substitute Policy cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying
aggregate premiums in excess of 300% of such amount, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be shall only be required to obtain as much
coverage as can be obtained by paying a premium equal to 300% of such amount.
Following the Effective Date, Parent shall cause such Tail Policy or Parent

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-35-  

  

 

 

 

  

Substitute Policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its or their
full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume, be jointly and
severally liable for, and honor, guarantee and stand surety for, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance
with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section
6.06. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its or their successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or other entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section
6.06.

  

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.06 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs,
executors and their legal and personal representatives. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 6.06 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding,
jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, and shall not be amended in a
manner adverse to any Indemnified Party (or their heirs, executors and their
legal and personal representatives) without the prior written consent of each
such Person. The Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be jointly and
severally be obligated to pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys'
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided in this Section 6.06.

  


 

  

Section 6.07 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statement with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to its
public release or disclosure; provided that (a) the Company shall be
permitted (upon obtaining the consent of Parent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to make such statements and
announcements to its employees as the Company shall deem to be reasonably
necessary, (b) the foregoing shall not limit the rights of the Company or the
Company Board under Section 5.02, (c) the Company will no longer be required
to consult with Parent in connection with any such press release or public
statement if the Company Board has effected any Change in Recommendation or
has resolved to do so, (d) the parties may make other public disclosures as
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange, (e) the foregoing
shall not restrict communications between any party and its Affiliates and
their respective lenders, investors, potential investors or other financing
sources and (f) the foregoing shall not limit the rights of the parties or any
of their respective Affiliates to make any statements to its or their
respective customers.

  


  Section 6.08 Shareholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation
against the Company or its Subsidiaries and/or their respective directors or
officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no
such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent's prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

  

Section 6.09 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, level of
benefits, and entitlement to benefits (but not benefit accrual) where length
of service is relevant under any benefit plan or arrangement of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries providing

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-36-  

  

 

 

 

  

benefits to any employee of the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries that
continues as an employee of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries after the Effective Time (such plans or arrangements,
collectively, the "New Plans" and each such employee, a "Company Employee"),
the Company Employees shall receive service credit for service with the
Company and the Company's Subsidiaries (and any respective predecessors) as if
such service were with Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or its
subsidiaries, including vacation time, sick time and recognized holidays,
except for benefit accrual or early retirement eligibility under any defined
benefit pension plan or to the extent any such service credit would result in
the duplication of benefits. In addition and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time or satisfaction of any other eligibility
requirements, in any and all New Plans and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause (A) all pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
under such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered
dependents, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitation,
exclusions, actively-at work requirements and waiting periods would have been
applicable under the comparable Benefit Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (B) any expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year ending on the
date such employee's participation in the New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for the purpose of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket requirements and similar expenses
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

  

  

(b) Subject to the last sentence of this sub-section 6.09(b), from and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall comply, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to comply with or satisfy
the severance, retention and any similar benefits and any Benefit Plan set
forth on Schedule 6.09 to this Agreement provided to a Company Employee under
an applicable Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, including
by recognizing all service recognized for such purposes under the applicable
Benefit Plan (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the affected Company
Employee). Subject to the last sentence of this sub-section 6.09(b), from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor in accordance with their terms any Benefit Plan that
continues to be in effect and to operate and administer such Benefit Plan in
good faith and accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
provision of this Agreement shall be construed as (i) requiring Parent to
adopt any specific New Plans or continue any specific Benefit Plans or (ii)
prohibiting or limiting the ability of Parent or its Affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any Benefit Plans or any New Plans and nothing herein
shall be construed as an amendment to any Benefit Plan or any New Plan for
any purpose.

  

  

(c) Nothing contained in this Section 6.09 is intended to confer upon any
Person (including any Company Employee) any right to employment or continued
employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to
a particular term or condition of employment, or shall in any way limit the
ability of Parent or any of its affiliates (including, following the Closing,
the Surviving Corporation) to terminate the employment of any employee
(including any Company Employee) at any time and for any or no reason, or is
intended to confer upon any Person (including any Company Employee) any rights
as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.10 Financing.

  

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the Financing
as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event not prior to the
consummation of the Marketing Period) on the terms and conditions described
in the Commitment

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-37-  

  

 

 

 

  

Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in full force
and effect the Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiate and enter into the
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contained in the Commitment Letters (including, as necessary, the "flex"
provisions contained in any related fee letter), (iii) comply with and satisfy
on a timely basis (or if determined advisable by Parent and Merger Sub, obtain
the waiver of) all terms, covenants and conditions applicable to Parent and
Merger Sub that are in their control to obtaining the Financing set forth in
the Commitment Letters and the definitive agreements related thereto such that
the Financing will be able to be consummated at or prior to the Effective
Time, and (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Effective Time
subject to the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters, and
it being understood that neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be in breach of
its obligations set forth above on account of the effects of any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties of the Company set forth herein or any
failure by the Company to comply with its obligations hereunder; provided,
that the foregoing (other than clause (i)) shall not apply with respect to the
Bank Financing in the event that and for so long as (A) Parent or Merger Sub
elect to pursue a high yield securities offering or other debt financing with
respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries (a "High Yield Debt Financing") in
lieu of the Bank Financing, (B) assuming the High Yield Debt Financing is
funded, the net proceeds contemplated by the High Yield Debt Financing,
together with the Equity Financing and cash or cash equivalents held by Parent
and Merger Sub, will in the aggregate be sufficient for Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (and any
repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or the High
Yield Debt Financing) and any other amounts required to be paid by Parent,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related
expenses at the Closing required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation, (C) Parent and Merger Sub use their commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
consummate the High Yield Debt Financing as soon as reasonably practicable and
(D) it is reasonably anticipated (in the good faith discretion of Parent) that
such High Yield Debt Financing would be consummated on or prior to the time
required for Closing under Section 1.02.

  

  

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company informed with respect to all
material activity concerning the status of the Financing and, if applicable,
the High Yield Debt Financing, and shall give the Company prompt notice of any
material adverse change with respect to the Financing, and, if applicable, the
High Yield Debt Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall notify
the Company promptly, and in any event within two Business Days, if at any
time (i) any of the Commitment Letters shall expire or be terminated for any
reason, (ii) any financing source that is a party to a Commitment Letter
notifies Parent that such source no longer intends to provide financing to
Parent (or, in the case of the Equity Commitment Letter, Merger Sub) on the
terms set forth therein, (iii) Parent is aware of any actual or threatened
material breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Commitment Letters or definitive agreements relating to the Commitment Letters
or any material dispute or disagreement between or among the parties to the
Commitment Letters or definitive agreements relating to the Commitment Letters
with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the
Financing to be funded at Closing, or (iv) for any reason Parent or Merger
Sub no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters on the terms
or within the timing described therein.

  

  

(c) If any portion of the Bank Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions or within the timing contemplated in the Bank Commitment Letter
(other than on account of the High Yield Debt Financing having been
completed), Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) use their reasonable best efforts
to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
alternative financing for any such portion from alternative
sources ("Alternative Financing") in an amount that will still enable Parent
and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason
therefor. If

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-38-  

  

 

 

 

  

obtained, (A) Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true and complete
copies of all agreements (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and
amendments thereto in effect, but provided that any related fee letters may be
redacted in a manner consistent with the redaction of the Fee Letters as
described in Section 4.05(a)) pursuant to which any such alternative source
shall have committed to provide Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation with Alternative Financing (collectively, "Alternative Commitment
Letters") and (B) the defined terms "Bank Financing" and "Bank Commitment
Letter" as used herein shall mean the Alternative Financing and Alternative
Commitment Letters.

  

  

(d) Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without the Company's prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) permit any
amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
any Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related thereto unless the
terms of such Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related thereto, in
each case as so amended, modified or waived, are substantially similar to
those in such Commitment Letter or definitive agreement related thereto, prior
to giving effect to such amendment, modification or waiver (other than
economic terms, which shall, taken as a whole, be as good as or better for
Parent (and, in the case of the Equity Commitment Letter, Merger Sub) than
those in such Commitment Letter or definitive agreement relating thereto prior
to giving effect to such amendment, modification or waiver (giving effect to
the "flex" provisions in any related fee letter)); provided that in the case
of amendments or modifications of, or any waiver of any provision or remedy
under, any Commitment Letter or a definitive agreement relating thereto, the
foregoing shall only apply if such amendment, modification or waiver (i) could
reasonably be expected to (A) adversely affect the ability or likelihood of
Parent or Merger Sub timely consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (B) make the timely funding of the Financing or the satisfaction
of the conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to occur, (ii)
reduces the amount of the Financing and the Equity Financing or Bank Financing
is not increased by a corresponding amount, or (iii) adversely affects the
ability of Parent (or, in the case of the Equity Commitment Letter, Merger
Sub) to enforce their rights against other parties to the Commitment Letters
or the definitive agreements relating thereto to require such parties to
provide the Financing. Upon any such permitted amendment, supplement, waiver
or modification or replacement of the Commitment Letters, (1) Parent shall
promptly deliver to the Company true and complete copies thereof (including
all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto in effect), and (2)
the defined terms "Bank Financing," "Bank Commitment Letter," "Equity
Financing" or "Equity Commitment Letter" (as applicable) as used herein shall
mean the Bank Financing, Bank Commitment Letter, Equity Financing or Equity
Commitment Letter (as applicable) as so amended, supplemented or modified or
replaced.

  

  

(e) In the event Parent or Merger Sub is required pursuant to this Section
6.10 to provide any information that is subject to attorney-client or similar
privilege, or in the event that such disclosure would violate any Law or
confidentiality obligation to third parties, Parent and Merger Sub may
withhold disclosure of such information to the same extent the Company may
withhold disclosure of comparable information pursuant to Section 6.03.

  

  

Section 6.11 Company Financing Assistance. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to, at the sole expense of Parent, use its and their
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such cooperation as may
be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing and the High Yield Debt Financing to be consummated in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with
the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and is subject to
customary confidentiality arrangements. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

  

  

(b) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger has not been consummated on

right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(b) shall not be

pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) has not taken any action or failed to take
any action that would cause it to be in material violation of any of its
covenants or agreements set forth in Section 6.04;

  

  

(e) by Parent, if the Company has breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this

8.02(a), 8.02(f), 9.07, 9.09(b), 9.09(c), 9.10, 9.11 and 9.13 (in each case,

such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or partial
exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this
Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other
rights under this Agreement.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section or
Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of, or Schedule
to, this Agreement unless otherwise

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-55-  

  

 

 

 

  

indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
References to "this Agreement" shall include the Company Disclosure Schedule;
provided, however, for purposes of Section 23B.11.050(1) of the WBCA, a
condensed version of this Agreement, excluding the Company Disclosure
Schedule, shall be the "plan of merger" filed with the Articles of Merger
pursuant to Section 1.03 of this Agreement. The inclusion of any item in the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence
of materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any standard of
materiality for any purpose whatsoever. All terms defined in this Agreement
shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document
made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well
as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any Contract, instrument or Law
defined or referred to herein or in any Contract or instrument that is
referred to herein means such Contract, instrument or Law as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of Contracts or
instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of Laws) by succession of
comparable successor Laws and references to all attachments thereto and
instruments incorporated therein. References to a Person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns.

  

  

(b) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement; consequently, in the event of an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provision of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.06 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which
taken together shall be considered one and the same agreement. The exchange of
a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or
by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

   
 

Section 9.07 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
(including the Company Disclosure Schedule and other Schedules) and the
Confidentiality Agreement and any agreements entered into contemporaneously
herewith constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement. Except
for (a) the rights of the Company's shareholders to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time, (b) the right of holders of Company Stock
Options and Restricted Stock Rights to receive at the Effective Time the
consideration set forth in Section 2.03, (c) the right of the Company, on
behalf of its shareholders, to pursue remedies under this Agreement, which
right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub, (d) the
rights of persons who are explicitly provided to be third party beneficiaries
of the Equity Commitment Letter solely to the extent of the rights set forth
therein, (e) this Section 9.07 and Sections 8.02(a), 8.02(f), 9.09(b),
9.09(c), Section 9.10, Section 9.11 and 9.13 and clause (b) of the proviso to
Section 8.03, which shall also be for the benefit of the Financing Sources and
other Persons referred to therein and the Financing Sources and such other
Persons are the intended third party beneficiaries thereunder and will be
entitled to rely on and enforce directly their rights and remedies under such
Sections, and (f) the provisions of Section 6.06, this Agreement is not
intended to and does not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto
any legal or equitable rights or remedies.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-56-  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 9.08 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in and
in all respects shall be interpreted, construed and governed by and in
accordance with, and any claim directly or indirectly arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be governed by, the laws of the state of
Delaware without regard to the conflict of law principles thereof insofar as
such principles would cause the laws of another jurisdiction to apply, except
that matters relating to the Merger, fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors and internal corporate affairs of the Company shall be governed by
the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to the conflict of law
principles thereof insofar as such principles would cause the laws of another
jurisdiction to apply.

  

  

Section 9.09 Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. (a) Except as
otherwise provided in Section 9.09(c), each of the parties hereto (i)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court within the State of Washington in
the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court and (iii) agrees that it shall not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court
other than any state or federal court within the State of Washington. Any
judgment from any such court described above may, however, be enforced by any
party in any other court in any other jurisdiction. Each party irrevocably
consents to the service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the
courts referred to in this Section 9.09 in any such action or proceeding by
mailing copies thereof by registered United States mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to
Section 9.03. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to
effect service of process on the other party by any other legally available
method.

  

  

(b) TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE BANK COMMITMENT LETTER (INCLUDING, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT,
ANY ALTERNATIVE COMMITMENT LETTER), THE BANK FINANCING, THE HIGH YIELD DEBT
FINANCING OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

   
 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.09 to the contrary, with
respect to any action of any kind or description (whether in law or in equity
and whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) involving any Financing
Source arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Bank Commitment
Letter (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Alternative Commitment
Letter), the Merger, the Bank Financing (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Alternative Financing), the High Yield Debt Financing, any other
transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or any service to be performed
hereunder or thereunder, the parties agree that (i) such actions shall be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York or any New York State court sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan and any appellate court therefrom and (ii) none of the
parties shall bring or permit any of its respective Affiliates or
Representatives to bring any such action referred to in this Section 9.09(c),
or voluntarily support any other Person in bringing any such action, in any
other courts.

  

  

Section 9.10 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, and any assignment without such consent shall be
null and void; provided that Parent and Merger Sub may assign or pledge its
rights hereunder to its Financing Sources as collateral security in connection
with the Bank Financing or the High Yield Debt Financing or may assign their
rights to an Affiliate of Parent, so long as Parent remains ultimately liable

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-57-  

  

 

 

 

  

for its indemnification obligations hereunder, in each case, without the prior
written consent of any party hereto. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  

  

Section 9.11 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

  

  

Section 9.12 Specific Performance; Remedies.

  

  

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. Accordingly, each of the parties acknowledges and
agrees that, subject to Section 8.02 and Section 9.12(c), prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, (i) they shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, including with respect to the making of required regulatory
filings in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity
and (ii) it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (A) the other party
has an adequate remedy at law or (B) an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security or provide proof of actual damages in
connection with any such order or injunction.

   
 

(b) The parties further agree that, except as expressly set forth herein, (i)
by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 9.12, a party shall not
in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available under this Agreement (including monetary damages) in the event that
the remedies provided for in this Section 9.12 are not available or otherwise
are not granted or satisfied, (ii) nothing in this Section 9.12 or a party's
pursuit of any rights under this Section 9.12 restrict or limit any party's
right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Section
8.01, and (iii) while a party may pursue both a grant of specific performance
in accordance with this Section 9.12 and the payment of a Parent Fee or
Company Termination Fee, as applicable, under no circumstances shall the a
party be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of (A) specific
performance of the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (which specific performance order is satisfied) and (B)
the payment of a Parent Fee or Company Termination Fee, as applicable.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to seek an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection
with enforcing Parent's or Merger Sub's obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded to fund the Merger or to consummate the Merger (but not
the right of the Company to such injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable remedies for obligations other than with respect to the Equity
Financings or to consummate the Merger) shall be subject to the requirements
that (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all conditions in Section 7.01 and
Section 7.02 were satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied by actions taken at Closing) at the time

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-58-  

  

 

 

 

  

when the Closing would have been required to occur but for the failure of the
Equity Financing to be funded, (ii) the Bank Financing (including the High
Yield Debt Financing or any other alternative financing that has been obtained
in accordance with, and satisfies the conditions of, Section 6.10 of this
Agreement) has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be
funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed that if the Equity Financing and Bank Financing (of, if applicable,
the High Yield Debt Financing or such other Alternative Financing) are
funded, then it would take such actions that are within its control to cause
the Closing to occur.

  

  

Section 9.13 Non-Recourse. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, subject only to the rights of the Company under the Equity
Commitment Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, all claims, obligations,
liabilities or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in
equity, or granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise
under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this
Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as
an inducement to enter into, this Agreement) or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be made only against (and are those solely of) the
entities that are expressly identified as parties to this Agreement in the
Preamble to this Agreement. Subject to the rights of the Company under the
Equity Commitment Letter (subject to the limitations contained therein), no
other Person, including any Financing Source, director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, affiliate, agent,
attorney or representative of, or any financial advisor or lender to, any
party to this Agreement or any director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, manager, stockholder, affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of, or any financial advisor or lender to any of the foregoing
shall have any liabilities (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in
equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations
