LIMITED, an Australian company (" _ _Parent__ "), and DISCOVERY MERGER
COMPANY, a Michigan corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _
_Merger Sub__ ," the Company and Merger Sub sometimes being
hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _ _Constituent Corporations__
").

   

RECITALS

   

    WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved this Agreement and declared
its advisability and approved the merger (the " _ _Merger__ ") of Merger Sub
with and into the Company in accordance with the Michigan Business
Corporation Act (the " _ _MBCA__ ") upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

   

    WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to
make certain representations, warranties,  covenants and agreements in
connection with this Agreement.

   

    WHEREAS,  as a condition and an inducement to Parent
and Merger Sub entering into this  Agreement, concurrently with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have
entered into certain voting agreements with Parent.

   

    WHEREAS, as a condition and an inducement to Parent and
Merger Sub entering into this Agreement, concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Mr. William Davis, Mr. Frank Jerneycic, Ms.
Kathryn Myers and Mr. Scott Smith (the " _ _Designated Employees__ ") have
entered into certain employment agreements and noncompetition agreements with

the Effective Time.

   

    NOW,  THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and
of the representations,  warranties, covenants and agreements contained
herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

   

## ARTICLE I

   

 _The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

   

    1.1.  _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the MBCA, at
the Effective Time (as defined

      
    

in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company
shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter
referred to as the " _ _Surviving Corporation__ "), and the separate
corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger,
except as set forth in Article II. At the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.3), the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable
provisions of the MBCA.

   

    1.2.  _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _
_Closing__ ") shall take place (i) at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP,
375 Park Avenue, New York, New York at 9:00 A.M. on the third business day
following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived
in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) at such other place and time or on
such other date as the Company and Parent may agree in writing (the " _
_Closing Date__ "). For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _business
day__ " shall mean any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other than a
Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks are required or authorized to
close in The City of New York.

   

    1.3.  _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable
following the Closing, the Company and Parent will cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the " _ _Certificate of
Merger__ ") with the Administrator specified in the MBCA, in such forms as
are required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
the MBCA (the date and time of such filing being the " _ _Effective Time__
").

   

ARTICLE II

   

 _Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws 
of the Surviving Corporation_

   

    2.1.  _Articles of Incorporation_. At the Effective
Time, the articles of incorporation of the Company (the " _ _Articles of
Incorporation__ ") shall be amended to read the same as the articles of
incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that Article 1 of the Articles of Incorporation shall be amended
in its entirety to read "The name of the corporation is: Learning Care Group,
Inc.", until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

   

    2.2.  _The By-Laws_. Immediately after the Effective
Time, Parent shall amend the bylaws of the Company to read the same as the
bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that all references to Merger Sub in the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be changed to refer to "Learning Care Group, Inc." (the " _
_By-Laws__ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable
law.

      
    

ARTICLE III

   

 _Officers and Directors of the Surviving Corporation_

   

    3.1.  _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all
actions necessary so that the board of directors of Merger Sub at the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and the By-Laws.

   

    3.2.  _Officers_. The parties hereto shall take all
actions necessary so that the officers of the Company at the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and the By-Laws.

   

ARTICLE IV

   

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; 
Exchange of Certificates_

   

    4.1.  _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of
any capital stock of the Company:

   

    (a)  _Merger Consideration_. Each share of common
stock, no par value, of the Company (a " _ _Share__ " and collectively, the "
_ _Shares__ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub and (ii) Shares owned by
the Company (each, an " _ _Excluded Share__ " and collectively, " _ _Excluded
Shares__ ")) shall be converted into the right to receive $7.50 per Share
(the " _ _Per Share Merger Consideration__ "). At the Effective Time, all of
the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and each certificate (a " _ _Certificate__ ") formerly representing
any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without
interest.

   

    (b)  _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Excluded Share
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment
of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

   

    (c)  _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of
common stock, no par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common
stock, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

      
    

    4.2.  _Exchange of Certificates_.

   

    (a)  _Paying Agent_. Parent shall make available or
cause to be made available to a bank, trust company or other paying agent
selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld (the " _ _Paying Agent__ "), amounts sufficient in the
aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make
payments of the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1(a)
(such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _ _Exchange Fund__ ").
Until so disbursed, Parent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be invested in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Rating Services, respectively, in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in similar investment funds or
common trust accounts offered or distributed by the Paying Agent.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a
part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable
under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to Parent.

   

    (b)  _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the
Effective Time (and in any event within three business days), Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent,
such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) in exchange for the Per Share Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with
the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount
in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(f)) equal to (x) the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check
for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be
issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

   

    (c)  _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of
Shares that were outstanding

      
    

immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount
in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to this Article IV.

   

    (d)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that
remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with
this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
required tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender
of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to
any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _Person__ " shall
mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or
limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 5.1(d))
or other entity of any kind or nature.

   

    (e)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the
event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by
such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be
required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required
tax withholdings) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

   

    (f)  _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax (as defined
in Section 5.1(n)) law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
(i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

      
    

    4.3.  _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

   

    (a)  _Company Options_. At the Effective Time each
outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " _ _Company Option__ ") under the
Stock Plans (as defined in Section 5.1(b)) and each outstanding standby
commitment stock option granted to certain members of JP Acquisition Fund
Group, vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the
holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total
number of Shares subject to the Company Option times (y) the excess, if any,
of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under
such Company Option less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment.

   

    (b)  _Company Awards_. At the Effective Time, each
right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Shares or
benefits measured by the value of Shares, and each award of any kind
consisting of Shares that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or
reserved for issuance under the Stock Plans and any other Benefit Plans,
in each case vested or unvested, other than Company Options (the " _ _Company
Awards__ "), shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to
receive an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of Shares subject to such
Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time times (y) the Per Share
Merger Consideration (or, if the Company Award provides for payments to the
extent the value of the Shares exceed a specified reference price, the
amount, if any, by which the Per Share Merger Consideration exceeds
such reference price), less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment.

   

    (c)  _Acknowledgement and Waiver_. If so requested by
Parent, at least 20 business days prior to the Effective Time and prior to
any such payment, the Company shall use its best efforts to obtain a written
acknowledgement and waiver (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent) from each holder of a Company Option or Company Award (i) confirming
the number of Company Options and Company Awards held, (ii) confirming
that the treatment of such Company Options and Company Awards, and the
consideration to be paid, pursuant to Section 4.3(a) and 4.3(b) is correct,
(iii) authorizing the withholding of all applicable taxes, and (iv)
containing such other matters as reasonably determined by Parent (an
"Acknowledgment and Waiver") and shall provide a copy of each such
Acknowledgement and Waiver to Parent at least five business days prior to
the Effective Time.

   

    (d)  _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, the Company, the board of directors of the Company and the compensation
committee of the board of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall
adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate
the provisions of Section 4.3(a) and 4.3(b). The Company shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver
Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in
settlement of Company Options or Company Awards.

      
    

    (e)  _Funding_. At and following the Effective Time,
Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Surviving
Corporation has funds sufficient to make the payments contemplated by this
Section 4.3.

   

    4.4.  _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event
that the Company changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to
the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including
a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the
Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

   

ARTICLE V

   

 _Representations and Warranties_

   

    5.1.  _Representations and Warranties of the Company_.
Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company not less than 24 hours
prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _ _Company Disclosure Letter__
"), or the Company Reports (as defined in Section 5.1(e)(i) filed on or prior
to the date hereof (it being understood and agreed that matters disclosed
pursuant to one section of the Company Disclosure Letter or contained in
the Company Reports shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any other
section of the Company Disclosure Letter to the extent that is apparent that
the matters so disclosed are applicable to such other section), the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

   

    (a)  _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and (to the extent such concept is applicable) in good
standing under the Laws (as defined in Section 5.1(i)) of its respective
jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is
in good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or to
have such power or authority, are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below). The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct
copies of the Companys and its Subsidiaries articles of incorporation and
by-laws or comparable governing documents, each as amended to date, and each
as so delivered is in full force and effect. Section 5.1(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of each jurisdiction
where the Company and its Subsidiaries are organized and qualified to do
business. As used in this Agreement, the term (i) " _ _Company Material
Adverse Effect__ " means a material adverse effect on the properties, assets,
liabilities,

      
    

business or current or anticipated financial condition or current or
anticipated results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the following, in and of
itself or themselves, shall constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect: (A)
changes in the economy or financial markets generally in the United States
or that are the result of acts of war or terrorism; (B) changes that are the
result of factors generally affecting the child care industry in the United
States (other than new legislation or rule-making or any changes in Laws);
(C) any loss of, or adverse change in, the relationship of the Company with
its employees, franchisees or suppliers that the Company establishes through
specific evidence was proximately caused by the pendency or the announcement
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (D) changes in United
States generally accepted accounting principles after the date hereof; and (E)
a decline in the price of the Company Common Stock on NASDAQ; provided that
the exception in this clause (E) shall not prevent or otherwise affect a
determination that any change, effect, circumstance or development underlying
such decline has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse
Effect; _provided_ , _further_ , that, with respect to clauses (A), (B) and
(D), such change, event, circumstance or development does not (i) primarily
relate only to (or have the effect of primarily relating only to) the Company
and its Subsidiaries or (ii) disproportionately adversely affect the
Company and its Subsidiaries compared to other companies of similar size
operating in the child care industry in the United States; and (ii) " _
_Subsidiary__ " means, with respect to any Person, any other Person of which
at least a majority of the securities or ownership interests having by their
terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or
other persons performing similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by such Person and/or by one or more of its Subsidiaries.

nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge,
security interest, claim or other encumbrance (each, a " _ _Lien__ "). Except
as set forth above, there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights,
options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption
rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or
rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to
subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are
authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon any issuance of any Shares in
accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear
of any Liens. The Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures,
notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the stockholders of the Company on any matter.

It is agreed and understood that such opinion is for the benefit of the Companys board of directors and may not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub. The board of directors of the Company has taken all action so that Parent will not be an "interested shareholder" or prohibited from entering into or consummating a "business combination" with the Company (in each case as such term is used in Sections 780 and 781 of the MBCA) as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions in the manner contemplated hereby.

---|--- 
   
       |

 (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or the comparable governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (B) with or without 

   
---|--- 
   
      
        |

 notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or
right of termination) or default under, the creation or acceleration of any
obligations under or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any agreement, lease, license,
contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other obligation (each, a
" _ _Contract__ ") binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or,
assuming (solely with respect to performance of this Agreement
and consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby) compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.1(d)(i), any Law

in the rights or obligations of any party under any Contract binding upon the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries except, in the case of clause (B) or (C)

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 5.1(d)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and complete list of Material
Contracts (as defined in Section 5.1(j)(i)(K)) pursuant to which consents or
waivers are or may be required prior to consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether or not subject to the
exception set forth with respect to clauses (B) and (C) above).

  
---|--- 
   
       |

 (iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any non-competition Contracts or other Contract that purports to limit in any material respect either the type of business in which the Company or its Subsidiaries (or, after giving effect to the Merger, Parent or its Subsidiaries) may engage or the manner or locations in which any of them may so engage in any business. 

   
---|--- 
   
       |

 (iv) The Company and its Subsidiaries are not creditors or claimants with respect to any debtors or debtor-in-possession subject to proceedings under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code with respect to claims that, in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the gross assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding cash and cash equivalents).

and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As
of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the
date of such amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports
filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will
not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the

Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.

Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and has identified for the Companys auditors and audit committee
of the Companys board of directors any material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting and (B) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Company has made
available to Parent (i) a summary of any such disclosure made by management
to the Companys auditors and audit committee since the Applicable Date and
(ii) any material communication since the Applicable Date made by management
or the Companys auditors to the audit committee required or contemplated by

accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no
concerns from Company employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing
matters, have been received by the Company. The Company has made available to
Parent a summary of all complaints or concerns relating to other matters made
since the Applicable Date through the Companys whistleblower hot-line or
equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns regarding possible
violations of Law. No attorney representing the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities laws,
breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Companys chief legal
officer, audit committee (or other committee designated for the purpose) of
the board of directors or the board of directors pursuant to the rules in
adopted pursuant to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Company
policy contemplating such reporting, including in instances not required by
those rules.

amount which would be material. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur a material tax or
penalty imposed by Section 4980 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA or any
material liability under Section 4071 of ERISA.

---|--- 
   
       |

 (v) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year. Neither the execution of this Agreement, stockholder adoption of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (w) entitle any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (x) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or

of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries have not been, and are not being,
conducted in violation of any federal, state, local or foreign law, statute
or ordinance, common law, or any rule, regulation, standard, judgment, order,
writ, injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency requirement, license or
permit of any Governmental Entity (collectively, " _ _Laws__ "), except for
such violations that are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No investigation or review by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
pending or, to the knowledge of an executive officer or the general counsel
of the Company, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated in
writing an intention to conduct the same, except for such investigations or

the general counsel of the Company, no material change is required in the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries processes, properties or procedures in

franchises, variances, exemptions and orders issued or granted by a
Governmental Entity (" _ _Licenses__ ") necessary to conduct its business as
presently conducted, except those the absence or noncompliance of which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

    6.2.  _Acquisition Proposals_.

   

    (a) The Company agrees that, except as expressly
permitted hereby, during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement
and ending at the Effective Time or such earlier date as this Agreement may
be terminated in accordance with its terms (" _ _Pre-Closing Period__ "),
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors
of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable
best efforts to instruct and cause its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or
representatives (such directors, officers, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives, collectively, "
_ _Representatives__ ") not to, directly or indirectly:

       |

 (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below); or 

   
---|--- 
   
        
         |

 (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal. 

   
---|--- 
   
   

    Notwithstanding  anything in the foregoing to the
contrary, prior to the adoption of this Agreement  at the Shareholders
Meeting (as defined in Section 6.4), the Company may (A) provide information
in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal providing for the
acquisition of more than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or total
voting power of the equity securities of the Company if the board of
directors receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.7); (B) engage
in discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal or (C) after having
complied with the notice requirements of this Section 6.2, approve, adopt,
recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose to approve, adopt,
recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition
Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x) in each such case referred
to in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the board of
directorsfiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (y) in each such case
referred to in clause (A) or (B), if the board of directors of the Company
has determined in good faith based on the information then available and
after consultation with its financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal
either constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal; and (z) in the case
referred to in clause (C) above, the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

   

    (b) For purposes of this Agreement: (i) " _
_Acquisition Proposal__ " means (A) any proposal or offer with respect to a
merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (B) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly
or indirectly, 10% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or consolidated total assets (including, without
limitation, equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each
case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) " _
_Superior Proposal__ " means an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal
involving all or substantially all of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or
the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company that the board
of directors of the Company has determined in its good faith judgment is
reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal and the Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would result
in a transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a
financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this

        
     

Agreement (after taking into account any revisions to the terms of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.2(c)).

   

    (c)  During the Pre-Closing Period, the board of
directors of the Company and each committee thereof shall not:

       |

 (i) except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger (it being understood that publicly taking a neutral position or no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal at any time beyond, but not equal to or less than, ten (10) business days after the first public announcement of such Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification); or 

   
---|--- 
   
       |

 (ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.2(a) entered into in the circumstances referred to in Section 6.2(a)) (an " _ _Alternative Acquisition Agreement__ ") relating to any Acquisition Proposal. 

   
---|--- 
   
   

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior
to the adoption of this Agreement at the Shareholders Meeting, the Company
board of directors may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company
Recommendation or approve, adopt, recommend or otherwise declare advisable
any Superior Proposal made or received after the date hereof and not
solicited, initiated or encouraged in breach of this Agreement, if, subject
to compliance with Section 6.2(f), the Company board of directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to
do so would be inconsistent with the board of directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law (a " _ _Change of Recommendation__ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Change of Recommendation may be made until after at least
72 hours following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company
advising that the Company board of directors intends to take such action and
the basis therefor. In determining whether to make a Change of Recommendation
in response to a Superior Proposal or otherwise, the Company board
of directors shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent or any other information provided by Parent in
response to such notice.

   

    (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall be
deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure obligations
under U.S. federal or state law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if such disclosure does not reaffirm the
Company Recommendation or has the substantive effect of withdrawing
or adversely qualifying or modifying the Company Recommendation, Parent,
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section
8.4(a).

        
     

    (e) The Company agrees that it will immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the
necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in
the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.2
and in the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company also agrees that it will
promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring it or any of its
Subsidiaries to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

   

    (f) The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in
any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or
offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such
information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiation are
sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives
indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if
applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current
basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations,
including any change in the Companys intentions as previously notified.

   

    6.3.  _Information Supplied_. The Company shall prepare
and file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, a proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the Shareholders
Meeting (as defined in Section 6.4) (such proxy statement, including any
amendment or supplement thereto, the " _ _Proxy Statement__ "). The Company
agrees, as to its and Subsidiaries, that (i) the Proxy Statement will
comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the
information supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date of
mailing to stockholders of the Company or at the time of the
Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

   

    6.4.  _Shareholders Meeting_. Subject to fiduciary
obligations under applicable law and Section 8.3(a), the Company will take,
in accordance with applicable Law and its articles of incorporation and by-
laws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the " _
_Shareholders Meeting__ ") as promptly as practicable after the execution of
this Agreement to consider and vote upon the approval and adoption of this
Agreement. Subject to Section 6.2 hereof, the board of directors of the
Company shall recommend such approval and adoption and shall take all lawful
action to solicit such approval and adoption of this Agreement.

        
     

    6.5.  _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

   

    (a) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the
receipt of all comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of
any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for
additional information and shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all
correspondence between the Company and/or any of its Representatives and the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall each use
its best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all
comments received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company shall
cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as possible
after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon
or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement.

   

    (b) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.2,
the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their reasonable best efforts to
take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement
and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable,
including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation
to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as
promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that (i) nothing in this Agreement, including without limitation,
this Section 6.5, shall require, or be construed to require, Parent to
proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of
or otherwise encumber or hold separate and agree to sell, divest, lease,
license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber before or after the
Effective Time, any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interest therein of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates (or to consent to any sale, divestiture, lease,
license, transfer, disposition or other encumberment by the Company of any of
its assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or
interest therein or to any agreement by the Company to take any of the
foregoing actions) or to agree to any material changes (including, without
limitation, through a licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other
impairment of Parents ability to own or operate, of any such
assets, licenses, product lines, businesses or interests therein or Parents
ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends or otherwise exercise full
ownership rights with respect to the stock of the Surviving Company and (ii)
nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be construed to require, Parent
or any of its Affiliates to take any other action under this Section 6.5 if
the United States Department of Justice or the United States Federal Trade
Commission authorizes its staff to seek a preliminary injunction
or restraining order to enjoin consummation of the Merger. The Company and
Parent will each request early termination of the waiting period with respect
to the Merger under the HSR Act. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall cooperate with respect
to all matters related to

        
     

the review by any Governmental Entity consistent with their respective
obligations hereunder; provided that Parent and the Company shall have the
right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult
with the other on and consider in good faith the views of the other
in connection with, all of the information relating to Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Proxy Statement).
In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

   

    (c) The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by
the other, promptly furnish the other with all information concerning itself,
its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters
as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

   

    (d) Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of
any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent of any change, fact or condition that is reasonably expected to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect or of any failure of any condition to
Parents obligations to effect the Merger. Parent shall give prompt notice to
the Company of any change, fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to
result in a breach of any representation or warranty or covenant of Parent or
of any failure of any condition to the Companys obligations to effect
the Merger.

   

    6.6.  _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law,
upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to) afford Parents officers and other authorized Representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the
Effective Time, to its employees, properties, books, contracts and records
and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to) furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested, _provided_ that no
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by the Company herein, and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i)
to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of
any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality if

        
     

the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of
such third party to such inspection or disclosure or (ii) to disclose any
privileged information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All
requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be directed
to the executive officer or other Person designated by the Company. All
such information shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

   

    6.7.  _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding
the Merger shall be a joint press release and thereafter the Company and
Parent each shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases
or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making
any filings with any third party or any Governmental Entity (including any
national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect
thereto, except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service or by the request of any Government Entity.

   

    6.8.  _Employee Benefits_.

   

    (a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2006, the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries will continue to be provided with pension and
welfare benefits under employee benefit plans that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than those currently provided by the Company and
its Subsidiaries to such employees. Parent will cause any employee benefit
plans which the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are eligible to
participate in to take into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting
thereunder, except to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits, service by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such
service were with Parent, to the same extent such service was credited under
a comparable plan of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained herein shall obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Affiliates to (i) maintain any particular Benefit Plan or (ii)
retain the employment of any particular employee.

   

    (b) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent
in writing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the
applicable plan or arrangement, the Company shall (i) cause to be amended the
employee benefit plans and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the
extent necessary to provide that no employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries
shall commence participation therein following the Effective Time unless
the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such
participation and (ii) cause the Companys 401(k) plan to be terminated
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.

   

    (c) Prior to making any written or oral communications
to the officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pertaining to the affects of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
on compensation and benefits matters, the

        
     

Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication,
Parent shall have a reasonable time to review and comment on the
communication, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing
any such mutually agreeable communication.

   

    6.9.  _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 8.5, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense.

   

    6.10.  _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers
Insurance_.

   

    (a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former director and officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity), determined as of
the Effective Time (the " _ _Indemnified Parties__ "), against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, " _ _Costs__ ") incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent that the Company would have been permitted under Michigan law and its
articles of incorporation or by-laws in effect on the date hereof to
indemnify such Person (and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also
advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law within thirty (30) days of receipt by Parent or Surviving Corporation of
a request therefor, _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification); and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any determination required to be made with respect to
whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the standards set
forth under Michigan law and the Companys articles of incorporation and by-
laws shall be made by independent counsel selected by the Surviving
Corporation.

   

    (b) The Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause the Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain,
provisions relating to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the Company
and its Subsidiaries that are at least as favorable as those that are
presently set forth in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company.

   

    (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 6.10, upon learning of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly
notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent
or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such
Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the

        
     

indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable
to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any
other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving
Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified
Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest
between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent
or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are
received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one
counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest; _provided_ that the fewest number of counsels
necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used; (ii) the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without their prior written consent; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder
to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction
shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final,
that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

   

    (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may
purchase insurance coverage extending for a period of up to six years the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance coverage in effect as
of the date hereof (covering part or future claims with respect to periods
before the Effective Time).

   

    (e) If Parent fails to comply with its obligations
under this Section 6.10, and, in order to enforce an Indemnified Partys
right under this Section 6.10, an Indemnified Party commences a suit that
results in a judgment against Parent that Parent breached its obligations
under this Section 6.10, Parent shall pay to the Indemnified Party
its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with such suit after delivery to Parent of
reasonable documentation evidencing such costs and expenses.

   

    (f) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of
its successors and assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall assume its obligations set forth in this Section
6.10.

        
     

    (g) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended to
be in addition to the rights otherwise available to the current and former
officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries by applicable Law,
charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and
their representatives.

   

    6.11.  _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is
or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Company and its board of directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute or regulation on such transactions.

Company tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer or, within ten
(10) business days after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer,
the Company board of directors fails to recommend unequivocally against
acceptance of such offer; (b) there has been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company in this Agreement, or any

such breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within
30 days after written notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company; or
(c) if the Company or any of the other Persons described in Section 6.2 as a
Representative of the Company shall take any of the actions that would be
proscribed by Section 6.2 but for the proviso therein allowing certain
actions to be taken pursuant to clause (A), (B) or (C) of the proviso under
the conditions set forth therein.

   

    8.5.  _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

   

    (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and
the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, this Agreement
shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party
hereto (or of any of its Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that (i) except as otherwise provided herein, no such termination
shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from (A)
any willful or intentional breach of this Agreement, or (B) the failure of
Parent to obtain the requisite financing to consummate the Merger, and (ii)
the provisions set forth in the second sentence of Section 9.1 shall survive
the termination of this Agreement.

   

    (b)  _In the event that_ (i) a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal shall have been made to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of its stockholders or any Person shall have publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and such
Acquisition Proposal or publicly announced intention shall not have been
publicly withdrawn without qualification (A) prior to, with respect to any
termination pursuant to Section 8.2(a), the date of termination, and (B) at
least five (5) Business Days prior to, with respect to termination pursuant
to Section 8.2(b), the date of the Shareholders Meeting) and thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
8.2(a) or 8.2(b), or (ii) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant
to Section 8.4(a) or 8.4(c) or (B) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b)
and, on or prior to the date of the Shareholders Meeting, any event giving
rise to Parents

        
       

right to terminate under Section 8.4(a) or 8.4(c) shall have occurred, or
(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a),
then the Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of $5,000,000 (the " _
_Termination Fee__ ") pursuant to this Section 8.5(b) and shall promptly, but
in no event later than two days after being notified of such by Parent,
pay all of the documented out-of-pocket expenses, including those of the
Paying Agent, incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement up to a maximum
amount of $1,000,000, in each case payable by wire transfer of same day
funds. The Termination Fee to be paid pursuant to clause (iii) of the
previous sentence shall be paid as set forth in Section 8.3(a).
No Termination Fee shall be payable to Parent pursuant to clause (i) or (ii)
of the first sentence of this Section 8.5(b) unless and until within twelve
(12) months of the termination of this Agreement the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternate Acquisition Agreement with
respect to, or shall have consummated or shall have approved or recommended
to the Companys stockholders or otherwise not opposed, an Acquisition
Proposal. For all purposes of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall
not be deemed to have been "publicly withdrawn" by any Person if, within
twelve (12) months of such termination, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to, or shall have consummated or shall have approved, adopted or
recommended to the Companys stockholders or otherwise not opposed, an
Acquisition Proposal made by or on behalf of such Person or any of its
Affiliates. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.5(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay
any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which results in a judgment
against the Company for the fee, charges or expenses to which reference is
made in this paragraph (b), the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
hereby acknowledge that in the event that the Termination Fee becomes payable
and is paid by the Company and accepted by Parent pursuant to this Section
8.5(b), the Termination Fee shall be Parents and Merger Subs sole and
exclusive remedy for monetary damages under this Agreement.
