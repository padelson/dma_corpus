<U>Exchange Procedures</U>. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within

record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of
transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company
may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) in
exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in
accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in
immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(f)) equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e))
multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable
upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be
exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to
evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.  </FONT></P>

Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore
complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other

Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as
may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) equal to the
number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by
the Per Share Merger Consideration.  </FONT></P>

with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in Section
5.1(n)) law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.  </FONT></P>

provided with pension and welfare benefits under employee benefit plans that are no less

employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate in to take into
account for purposes of eligibility and vesting thereunder, except to the extent it would
result in a duplication of benefits, service by employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent such service was

within thirty (30) days of receipt by Parent or Surviving Corporation of a request
therefor, <U>provided</U> that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification); and <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that any determination
required to be made with respect to whether an officer&#146;s or director&#146;s conduct
complies with the standards set forth under Michigan law and the Company&#146;s articles
