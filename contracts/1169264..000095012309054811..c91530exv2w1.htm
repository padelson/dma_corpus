    ##### 

  

   

good faith between Seller and Purchaser, but in all events shall be consistent

Litigation, ICX Excluded Liabilities or the operation of businesses of Seller
and its Subsidiaries other than the Business. 

   

SECTION 2.02. _Assumption of Assumed Liabilities; Retention of Retained
Liabilities_. 

  

(a) At the Closing, Purchaser shall (or shall cause one or more of its wholly
owned Subsidiaries designated by Purchaser not less than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date to) assume and become obligated to pay,
perform and discharge when due, the following Liabilities of Seller or any

(i) all Liabilities relating to the Transferred Assets or the Business to
the extent arising from or relating to any event, circumstance or condition
occurring on or after the Closing; 

   

(ii) all Liabilities under the Assumed Contracts and the Shared

of such Assumed Contracts or Shared Contracts, as applicable, as a result of

Seller Disclosure Schedule_. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Seller or the relevant Seller Subsidiary shall retain, and shall be fully
responsible for paying, performing and discharging when due, and Purchaser
shall not assume or have any responsibility for, any Liabilities of Seller
and the Seller Subsidiaries other than the Assumed Liabilities (the "Retained
Liabilities"), including the following: 

   

(i) any Liability arising out of the Excluded Assets; 

   

(ii) any of Sellers Liabilities for expenses and fees incident to or
arising out of the negotiation, preparation, approval or authorization of
this Agreement or the consummation (or preparation for the consummation) of
the Transactions (including all attorneys, accountants and brokerage fees,
but not including any transfer Taxes, which shall be governed by _Section
7.01_); 

   

(iii) any Liability related to any Employee or Seller Benefit Plan, except
to the extent such Liability relates to a Transferred Employee and is assumed
by Purchaser pursuant to _Article VI_; 

   

(iv) any obligation or liability under any intercompany accounts payable to

Statement; 

   

(vi) any of Sellers liabilities or obligations for which Purchaser may
become liable as a result of or in connection with the failure by Purchaser
or Seller to comply with any bulk sales or bulk transfers laws or as a result
of any "de facto merger" or "successor-in-interest" theories of liability, to
the extent that any such noncompliance results in Purchaser assuming or
becoming responsible for any Liability not set forth in _Section 2.02(a)_;
and 

   

(vii) any of Sellers Liabilities not otherwise referred to in this
_Section 2.02(b)_ to the extent relating to any Action arising out of or in
connection with Sellers or any of its Subsidiaries conduct of the Business
prior to the Closing, in each case other than Assumed Liabilities. 

  

For purposes of this _Section 2.02(b)_, "Seller" shall be deemed to include
all Affiliates and Subsidiaries of Seller and any predecessors to Seller and
any Person with respect to which Seller is a successor-in-interest (including
by operation of law, merger, liquidation, consolidation, assignment,
assumption or otherwise). Seller hereby acknowledges that it is retaining the
Retained Liabilities. 

   

SECTION 2.03. _Purchase Price; Allocation of Purchase Price_. 

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in consideration of
the transfer of the Shares and the Transferred Assets under _Section 2.01_,
Purchaser on its own behalf and, as applicable, as agent for its designated
Subsidiaries, shall (i) pay to Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries an amount
of cash (the "Purchase Price") equal to $175,000,000 (the "Base 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Purchase Price"), as adjusted in accordance with _Section 2.03(c)_ and
_Section 2.04(b)_ , and (ii) assume and become obligated to pay, perform and
discharge the Assumed Liabilities. 

  

(b) For purposes of determining the amount of cash to be paid as the Estimated
Purchase Price by Purchaser to Seller at the Closing pursuant to _Section
2.07_, Seller shall prepare and deliver, not less than five Business Days
before the Closing Date, a good faith estimate of the Working Capital as of
the Closing (such estimated amount, the "Estimated Working Capital"),
which shall be calculated based on financial information for the Business as
of the most recent financial quarter for which such financial information is
available. 

  

(c) As used in this Agreement, the "Estimated Purchase Price" shall mean an
amount equal to the Base Purchase Price _plus_ an amount equal to the
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment (which may be positive or negative). 

  

(d) The Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities shall be allocated among
the Shares and the Transferred Assets in accordance with their fair market
values as mutually determined by Purchaser and Seller (the "Allocation
Schedule") for all Tax purposes, including for purposes of Section 1060 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (but except as provided below
in this  _Section 2.03(d)_ or in _Section 7.05_). Seller shall prepare an
Allocation Schedule within fifteen (15) calendar days after the final
Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities have been finalized pursuant to
_Section 2.04_. Purchaser agrees that, within fifteen (15) days of receiving
the Allocation Schedule, it shall sign it and return an executed copy thereof
to Seller. If, within fifteen (15) calendar days after the delivery of the
Allocation Schedule, Purchaser notifies Seller in writing that Purchaser
objects to the allocation set forth therein, Seller and Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute. In the event that
Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve the dispute within fifteen (15)
calendar days, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties within ten (10)
calendar days, the Accounting Arbitrator selected pursuant to _Section
2.04(d)_ shall resolve the disagreement within thirty (30) calendar days
after being selected. In the event the Accounting Arbitrator concludes that
Seller was correct as to a majority (by dollar amount) of the disputed items,
then Purchaser shall pay the Accounting Arbitrators fees, costs and
expenses. In the event the Accounting Arbitrator concludes that Purchaser was
correct as to a majority (by dollar amount) of the disputed items, then
Seller shall pay the Accounting Arbitrators fees, costs and expenses. For all
Tax purposes (except with respect to Tax Returns the timely filing of which
may not be extended, without the imposition of penalties, until after the
Allocation Schedule has been finalized), Purchaser and Seller agree (i) to
report, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to report, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent in all material respects
with the final Allocation Schedule, which shall be binding upon Purchaser and
Seller and their respective Subsidiaries and (ii) not to take any position
inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return, Tax filing (including filings
required under Section 1060 of the Code), audit, refund claim or otherwise. 

   

SECTION 2.04. _Purchase Price Adjustment_. 

  

(a) Seller has prepared the attached _Exhibit E_, which lists the current
asset and current liability accounts of the Business that are relevant for
the determination of the Working Capital and sets forth the accounting
principles, methodologies and policies to be used in such determination (the
"Calculation Principles") as well as a format for the Working
Capital calculation. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted after the Closing
in accordance with this  _Section 2.04_ based upon the Working Capital as of
the Closing (the "Final Working Capital"). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

For purposes hereof, the statement of the Final Working Capital, together with
the calculation of the Purchase Price pursuant to this _Section 2.04_, shall
be referred to as the "Closing Statement." 

  

(b) If (i) the Purchase Price Adjustment as finally determined in accordance
with this  _Section 2.04_ (i) is a positive number, Purchaser shall pay to
Seller an amount equal to the Purchase Price Adjustment, or (ii) is a
negative number, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the Purchase Price Adjustment,
in either case by wire transfer, within three Business Days after the
final determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment, of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the party receiving payment, plus
interest on such amount accrued from the Closing Date to the date of such
payment at the prime rate applicable from time to time as announced
by Citibank, N.A. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Purchase Price
Adjustment as finally determined in accordance with this _Section 2.04_ is
equal to $0.00, no payment shall be made by or to either party pursuant to
this _Section 2.04_ and the final Purchase Price shall be the same as the
Estimated Purchase Price. 

  

(c) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event later than
75 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare (or cause to be
prepared) and deliver to Seller the Closing Statement in accordance with this
_Section 2.04_. If Seller disagrees with the determination of the Closing
Statement, Seller shall notify Purchaser of such disagreement within 30 days
after delivery of the Closing Statement (such notice, the "Disagreement
Notice"). The Disagreement Notice shall set forth, in reasonable detail, any
disagreement with, and any requested adjustment to, the Closing Statement.
Matters as to which Seller may submit disagreements (and the Disagreement
Notice) shall be limited to whether the Closing Statement delivered by
Purchaser was prepared on the basis of, and using, the Calculation
Principles, and Seller shall not be entitled to submit disagreements on any
other basis (including as to whether such Calculation Principles are or were
appropriate). If Seller fails to deliver the Disagreement Notice by the end of
such 30-day period, Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing
Statement delivered by Purchaser. Matters included in the calculations in the
Closing Statement to which Seller does not object in the Disagreement Notice
shall be deemed accepted by Seller and shall not be subject to
further dispute or review. During the period prior to Sellers delivery of
any Disagreement Notice, Seller shall have reasonable access to all
documents, schedules and workpapers used by Purchaser in the preparation of
the Closing Statement. Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve any such disagreement with respect to the Closing Statement, and
any resolution agreed to in writing by Purchaser and Seller shall be final
and binding upon the parties. 

  

(d) If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement as
contemplated by paragraph (c) of this _Section 2.04_ within 30 days after
delivery of a Disagreement Notice by Seller, Purchaser and Seller shall
jointly select a partner at a mutually agreeable accounting firm to resolve
such disagreement. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to reach agreement on
the identity of such a partner within 20 days after the expiration of such
30-day period, either party may request that a partner at a nationally
recognized accounting firm, other than a partner at either partys current
accounting firm, be appointed by the American Arbitration Association.
The individual so selected shall be referred to herein as the "Accounting
Arbitrator." The parties shall instruct the Accounting Arbitrator to consider
only those items and amounts set forth in the Closing Statement as to which
Purchaser and Seller have not resolved their disagreement. Purchaser and
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting
Arbitrator to deliver to the parties, as promptly as practicable (and in no
event later than 30 days after his or her appointment), a written report
setting forth the resolution 

  

    ##### 

  

   

of any such disagreement determined in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Such report shall be final and binding upon the parties. In the
event the Accounting Arbitrator concludes that Seller was correct as to a
majority (by dollar amount) of the disputed items, then Purchaser shall pay
the Accounting Arbitrators fees, costs and expenses. In the event
the Accounting Arbitrator concludes that Purchaser was correct as to a
majority (by dollar amount) of the disputed items, then Seller shall pay the
Accounting Arbitrators fees, costs and expenses. 

  

(e) Purchaser and Seller agree that any payments made pursuant to this
_Section 2.04_ shall be allocated in a manner consistent with the allocation
referred to in _Section 2.03(d)_. 

  

SECTION 2.05. _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the sale and purchase of the Shares and the Transferred Assets and
the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, all as contemplated hereby, shall
take place at a closing (the "Closing") to be held at 11:00 AM, Eastern time,
on the first Business Day that is (a) at least two Business Days following
the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the obligations of the
parties set forth in _Article VIII_ (other than conditions to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to the waiver or fulfillment of those conditions)
and (b) mutually agreed upon in writing by Seller and Purchaser (the day on
which the Closing takes place being the "Closing Date"), at the offices of
Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP located at One Liberty Plaza, New York,
New York, or at such other place as Seller and Purchaser may mutually agree
upon in writing. Legal title, equitable title and risk of loss with respect
to the Shares and the Transferred Assets will transfer to Purchaser (or its
designated Subsidiaries as allowed hereunder), and the Assumed Liabilities
will be assumed by Purchaser (or its designated Subsidiaries as allowed
hereunder), at the Closing, which transfer and assumption will be deemed
effective for accounting and other computational purposes as of 12:01 a.m.
(Eastern Time) on the Closing Date. 

  

SECTION 2.06. _Closing Deliveries by Seller_. At the Closing, Seller and the
Seller Subsidiaries shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Purchaser: 

  

(a) evidence reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser of the sale and transfer at
the Closing of the Shares to Purchaser (or its designated Subsidiaries as
allowed hereunder); 

  

(b) letters of resignation, effective as of the Closing Date, from the
directors and officers of ICX listed in _Section 2.06(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule_; 

  

(c) a counterpart of each of the Ancillary Agreements, executed by each of
Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries that is a party thereto, to the extent not
delivered prior to the Closing; and 

  

(d) any other documents required pursuant to this Agreement or reasonably
requested by Purchaser. 

  

SECTION 2.07. _Closing Deliveries by Purchaser_. At the Closing, Purchaser
shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries: 

  

(a) a counterpart of each of the Ancillary Agreements, executed by each of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries that is a party thereto, to the extent not
delivered prior to the Closing; 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) the Estimated Purchase Price by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to an account or accounts of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries
designated at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date by Seller in
a written notice to Purchaser; and 

   

(c) any other documents required pursuant to this Agreement or reasonably
requested by Seller. 

  

SECTION 2.08. _Accounting_. To the extent that, after the Closing, (a)
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including ICX) receives any payment or
instrument that is for the account of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
according to the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser shall promptly deliver
such amount or instrument to Seller, and (b) Seller or any of the
Seller Subsidiaries receives any payment or instrument that is for the
account of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including ICX) according to
the terms of this Agreement, Seller shall promptly deliver such amount or
instrument to Purchaser. 

   

SECTION 2.09. _Nonassignable Assets_. 

  

(a) Nothing in this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall be construed as an attempt or agreement to assign
or transfer any Transferred Asset (including any Assumed Contract or any
Shared Contract) to Purchaser which by its terms or by Law is nonassignable
without a Consent (a "Nonassignable Asset"), unless and until such Consent
shall have been obtained. Seller shall advise Purchaser in writing at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (a) of any Material Contract
with a Material Customer with respect to which a Consent of the counterparty
is required for assignment and (b) if, to the Knowledge of Seller, Seller has
received written notice by letter, facsimile or email that such Material
Customer will not agree to the assignment of any Material Contract described
in clause (a) to Purchaser hereunder at the Closing. To the extent permitted
by applicable Law and by the terms of the applicable Nonassignable Asset,
such Nonassignable Asset shall be held, as of and from the Closing, by
Seller (or the relevant Seller Subsidiary) for the benefit and burden of
Purchaser and the covenants and obligations thereunder shall be fully
performed by Purchaser on Sellers (or such Seller Subsidiarys) behalf and
all rights and Liabilities existing thereunder that would constitute Assumed
Liabilities shall be for Purchasers account. For the avoidance of doubt, the
designation of a Transferred Asset as a Nonassignable Asset does not render
it an Excluded Asset. Subject to  _Section 5.08_, after the Closing, Seller
and Purchaser will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
Consents to assignment of Nonassignable Assets and/or to remove any other
impediments to the transfer or assignment of each Nonassignable Asset or, in
the case of a Vendor Shared Contract and to the extent the necessary Consent
for transfer or assignment has not otherwise been obtained and Purchaser so
requests, to encourage the relevant Vendor to enter into a separate Contract
with Purchaser in respect of the relevant Vendor Shared Contract, and Seller
will transfer or assign each Nonassignable Asset to Purchaser (or a
Subsidiary designated by it) within five (5) Business Days after the receipt
of Consent thereto and/or removal of such impediment. 

  

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and by the terms of the
applicable Nonassignable Asset, Seller and Purchaser shall take, or cause to
be taken, at Purchasers expense, such actions as the other party may
reasonably request that are required to be taken or appropriate in order
to provide Purchaser with the benefits and burdens of the Nonassignable
Assets (including renewing, extending or terminating any such Nonassignable
Asset in accordance with its terms), and Seller shall promptly pay over to
Purchaser the net 

  

    ##### 

  

   

amount (after expenses and Taxes) of all payments received by it (or a Seller
Subsidiary) in respect of all Nonassignable Assets (but only to the extent
such payments would constitute Transferred Assets) and Purchaser shall
indemnify Seller (or a Seller Subsidiary) for all Losses attributable to
Sellers (or such Seller Subsidiarys) holding of all Nonassignable Assets
(but only to the extent such Losses would constitute Assumed Liabilities). 

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller (or the applicable Seller
Subsidiary) shall have the right, any time after the twelve-month anniversary
of the Closing Date to exercise any right to terminate any Nonassignable
Asset that is an Assumed Contract or a Vendor Shared Contract and shall have
the right, any time after the second anniversary of the Closing Date to
exercise any right to terminate any Nonassignable Asset that is a Customer
Shared Contract; _provided_ that, Seller shall be entitled at any time to
amend or terminate any Contract that subsumes a Vendor Shared Contract to the
extent that Purchaser has entered into a separate Contract with the relevant
Vendor with respect to such Vendor Shared Contract; and _provided_ _further_
that, in each case, Seller shall provide to Purchaser at least ninety (90)
days prior written notice of its intention to terminate such Nonassignable
Asset. 

  

ARTICLE III 

   

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER 

   

For purposes of the representations and warranties of Seller contained herein,
other than  _Section 3.06_, disclosure in any section of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule of any facts or circumstances shall be deemed to be
adequate response and disclosure of such facts or circumstances with respect
to all representations or warranties by Seller calling for disclosure of
such information, whether or not such disclosure is specifically associated
with or purports to respond to one or more of such representations or
warranties, to the extent a matter is disclosed in such a way as to make its
relevance to such other representation or warranty readily apparent.
The inclusion of any information in any section of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or other document delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement
shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of the materiality of such
item, nor shall it establish a standard of materiality for any
purpose whatsoever. 

  

Except (a) as set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedule in accordance with
the preceding paragraph or (b) to the extent relating solely to the Excluded
Assets, Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows. 

   

SECTION 3.01. _Organization and Good Standing_. 

  

(a) Seller, and each Seller Subsidiary that is or will be a party to this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Seller and each such Seller Subsidiary is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned
or leased by it or the operation of its business makes such licensing
or qualification necessary, except to the extent that the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect or a materially adverse effect upon Sellers or such
Seller Subsidiaries ability to carry out its 

  

    ##### 

  

   

obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to
consummate the Transactions. 

  

(b) ICX is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of Delaware and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. As of the Closing Date, ICX will be duly licensed or qualified to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned or leased by it
or the operation of its business makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except to the extent that the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
ICX has no assets other than those used or held for use in the Business
and conducts no business other than the Business. 

  

SECTION 3.02. _Authority_. Seller, and each Seller Subsidiary that is or will
be a party thereto, has full power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is or will be a signatory
and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution,

that any such access shall be conducted in accordance with Law (including any

representatives, or provide Purchaser or its representatives with, (i) any
Tax Return filed by Seller or any of its Affiliates or predecessors, or any
related material, except to the extent relating solely to the Transferred
Assets, or (ii) any information if making such information available would

privilege or contravening such Law, duty or agreement. If any material is
withheld by such party pursuant to the preceding sentence, Seller shall
inform Purchaser as to the general nature of what is being withheld.

hereto shall promptly notify the other party of the failure of the other
party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by the other party pursuant to this Agreement of
which the notifying party becomes aware and which would reasonably be expected
to result in any condition to the obligations of the other party to effect
the transactions provided for in this Agreement not to be satisfied;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 5.02(c)_ (i) shall not cure any breach of any representation or
warranty requiring disclosure of such matter at or prior to the execution of
this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder
to the party receiving such notice and (ii) shall not be given any effect for
the purpose of (x) determining the accuracy of any of the representations and

Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries prior to the Closing of the Transferred
Assets or the Business, (ii) if required to be made under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any
other Law or the rules of any relevant securities exchange. Business

publicly available, either before or after the Closing Date, except through
a violation of this Agreement, (y) has been lawfully acquired after the
Closing Date by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries on a non-confidential basis

by documents subpoena, civil investigative demand, interrogatories, requests
for information, or other similar process to disclose any Business
Confidential Information which otherwise may not be disclosed except as set

extent permitted, provide reasonable notice to Purchaser of such request or
demand or other similar

announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of (i) Seller, in the
event the disclosing party is Purchaser, or (ii) Purchaser, in the event the
disclosing party is Seller, in each case such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, except each party may make such disclosure
to the extent so required pursuant to an applicable requirement of Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities
exchange, provided that each party shall give the other a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such disclosure to the
extent practicable. 

   

SECTION 5.04. _Efforts and Actions to Cause the Closing to Occur_. 

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do or cause the conditions set forth
in _Section 8.01_ and _Section 8.03 _to be satisfied, and Purchaser shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do or cause the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_ and 
_Section 8.02_ to be satisfied. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller and

filed with Governmental Authorities and other Persons necessary to consummate
the Closing and take such actions as are necessary to obtain any requisite
Consent, (ii) seek to prevent the initiation of any Action by any
Governmental Authority and defend any Actions by or before any Governmental
Authority challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Closing and
(iii) appeal or otherwise cause to be lifted or rescinded any Governmental
Order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the
Closing. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of
Purchaser and Seller agrees to make or cause to be made an appropriate filing
of any Notification and Report Form required pursuant to the HSR Act and
any filings or applications that Purchaser and Seller mutually agree are
appropriate and necessary under the Laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction,
including the European Union or any member state thereof, as soon as
practicable after the date hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section
5.04(a)_ to the contrary, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be obligated to
make any payment or deliver anything of material value to any third party
(other than filing and application fees to Governmental Authorities) in order
to obtain any Consent. 

  

(b) If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for
information or documentary material from any Governmental Authority with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
then such party shall endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made,
as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other
party, an appropriate response in compliance with such information and/or
documentary request.

(iii) promptly notifying each other of any communications from or with
any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; 

   

(iv) not participating in any substantive meetings, discussions
or presentations, whether in-person, telephonically, or via any other means,
with any Governmental Authority in connection with proceedings under or
relating to the HSR Act, other competition Laws of any jurisdiction, or Laws
regulating foreign investment of any jurisdiction in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless it consults with the
other party in advance, and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat; and 

   

(v) consulting and cooperating with one another in connection with
all analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto
in connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act, competition
Laws of any jurisdiction, or Laws regulating foreign investment of any
jurisdiction, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

or business; (ii) license or otherwise make available to any Person any
technology or other intellectual property rights associated with any such
asset or business; (iii) hold separate any assets or operations

(e) Prior to deciding whether to provide any commitment to any antitrust,
competition or similar Governmental Authority granting an additional time
period to review the Transactions or committing not to close the Transactions
during such review period or to deciding whether to withdraw and refile any
filing made under the HSR Act (any such commitment or decision, an "Antitrust
Extension Decision"), each of Purchaser and Seller will consult with and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection therewith.
Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, (i) during the period from the
date hereof until June 30, 2010, Purchaser shall have the sole right to make
any Antitrust Extension Decision without Sellers consent and (ii) from
and after June 30, 2010, any Antitrust Extension Decision shall 

  

    ##### 

  

   

require the consent of each of Purchaser and Seller, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

SECTION 5.05. _Bulk Sales_. Purchaser hereby waives compliance by ICX, Seller

reasonably be required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and give effect to the Transactions, including the
execution and delivery of such assignments, deeds and other documents as may
be necessary to transfer any Transferred Assets as provided in this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Closing (i)
Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries shall do all things necessary, proper or
advisable as reasonably requested by Purchaser in order to put Purchaser
in effective possession, ownership and control of the Transferred Assets, and
Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller for such purpose, including obtaining
consents from any third parties to the extent necessary to transfer any
Assumed Contract to Purchaser (or its designated Affiliates) and (ii)
Purchaser shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) do all things necessary,
proper or advisable as reasonably requested by Seller (A) to transfer to
Seller (or such other Person as Seller shall indicate) any Excluded Assets
that Purchaser may possess and (B) to assure that Purchaser, rather than
Seller or any Seller Subsidiary, is the obligor in respect of all
Assumed Liabilities, including by novating any Assumed Contract that is a
Nonassignable Asset to Purchaser and seeking to cause the counterparty to any
Shared Contract to enter into a new agreement with Purchaser with respect to
the matters addressed in such Shared Contract, and Seller shall
cooperate with Purchaser for such purposes, provided that neither Purchaser
nor Seller shall be obligated to make any payment or deliver anything of
value to any third party (other than filing and application fees to
Governmental Authorities, which shall be split equally between Seller and
Purchaser) in order to obtain any Consent to the transfer of Transferred
Assets or the assumption of Assumed Liabilities. If, at any time within six
(6) months after the Closing, any party discovers any material right,
service, property or assets used or held for use by Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with owning and operating the Business prior
to the Closing that is not an Excluded Asset and was not transferred or
provided to Purchaser as of the Closing, (i) if such right, service, property
or asset was used or held for use by Seller prior to the Closing exclusively
in connection with owning and operating the Business, the parties shall take
all commercially reasonable actions to effect the transfer thereof to
Purchaser, (ii) if such right, service, property or asset was used or held
for use by Seller prior to the Closing primarily in connection with owning
and operating the Business, the parties shall take all
commercially reasonable actions to effect the transfer thereof to Purchaser
and the parties shall arrange for Purchaser to provide Seller the benefit of
such right, service, property or asset for use in Sellers 

  

    ##### 

  

   

retained business following the Closing, and (iii) in all other cases, the
parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for Seller to
provide Purchaser the benefit of such right, service, property or asset for
use in the Business following the Closing pursuant to the terms of the
Transition Services Agreement; _provided_ that (x) upon the transfer
to Purchaser under clause (i) or (ii) above of any right, service, property
or asset, Purchaser shall assume any corresponding liability and (y) neither
Purchaser nor Seller shall be obligated to make any payment or deliver
anything of value to any third party (other than filing and application fees
to Governmental Authorities, which shall be split equally between Seller and
Purchaser) in order to effect any transfer described in this sentence. 

  

(b) Purchaser shall, upon the request of Seller, and at no cost to Seller
(other than reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses), make the Transferred
Employees available at reasonable times and cooperate in all reasonable
respects with Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries in the preparation for, and
defense of, any lawsuit, arbitration or other Action (whether disclosed or
not disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule) filed or claimed against
Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of the respective agents, directors,
officers and employees of Seller and its Affiliates, whether currently
pending or asserted in the future, concerning the operation or conduct of the
Business prior to the Closing Date (including any Retained Litigation), except
with respect to any Actions between Seller and Purchaser that may arise as a
result of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

waive any term of the Contribution Agreement without Purchasers prior consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

(b) From and after the date hereof, Purchaser shall execute and deliver the
ATLAS Sublicense to Seller, and Seller shall deliver such executed ATLAS
Sublicense to TNS and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause TNS to
execute and deliver the ATLAS Sublicense to Purchaser as soon as practicable.
In the event TNS fails to deliver an executed ATLAS Sublicense to Purchaser
within five (5) days prior to the Closing, Seller shall provide to TNS a
written waiver of TNSs obligation to obtain an ATLAS Sublicense and Seller
and Purchaser agree to execute a license between themselves, effective as of
the Closing, providing for substantially similar rights and obligations as
contained in the ATLAS Sublicense to the extent necessary for Purchaser to
utilize the services being provided to Purchaser by TNS using ATLAS. In the
event that TNS purports to terminate the ATLAS Sublicense to Purchaser
pursuant to Section 7.01 of the ATLAS Sublicense prior to May 1, 2012 and
there is no independent right of TNS to terminate the ATLAS Sublicense
pursuant to Section 7.02 thereof, Seller and Purchaser agree to enter into a
license agreement that provides Purchaser with substantially similar rights
and obligations as are set forth in the Atlas Sublicense, to the extent
necessary for Purchaser to utilize the services being provided to Purchaser
by TNS using ATLAS. 

  

SECTION 5.10. _Maintenance of Books and Records_. After the Closing Date, each
of the parties hereto shall, and Purchaser shall cause ICX to, preserve,
until at least the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, all pre-Closing
Date records to the extent relating to the 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Business possessed or to be possessed by such Person. After the Closing Date
and up until at least the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, upon any
reasonable request from a party hereto or its representatives, the party
holding such records shall (a) provide to the requesting party or its
representatives reasonable access to such records during normal business hours
and (b) permit the requesting party or its representatives to make copies of
such records, in each case at no cost to the requesting party or its
representatives (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall require either party to
disclose any information to the other if such disclosure would jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege or contravene any applicable Law,
fiduciary duty or agreement (it being understood that each party shall
cooperate in any reasonable efforts and requests for waivers that would enable
otherwise required disclosure to the other party to occur without so
jeopardizing privilege or contravening such Law, duty or agreement) or
require either party to disclose its Tax records. Such records may be sought
under this _Section 5.10_ for any reasonable purpose, including to the
extent reasonably required in connection with accounting, litigation, federal
securities disclosure or other similar needs of the party seeking such
records (other than claims between Seller and Purchaser or any of their
respective Subsidiaries under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any and all such records may
be destroyed by a party if such destroying party sends to the other party
hereto written notice of its intent to destroy such records, specifying in
reasonable detail the contents of the records to be destroyed; such
records may then be destroyed after the 60th day following such notice unless
the other party hereto notifies the destroying party that such other party
desires to obtain possession of such records, in which event the destroying
party shall transfer the records to such requesting party and such requesting
party shall pay all reasonable expenses of the destroying party in
connection therewith and (ii) no party shall be required to provide the other
party access to, or copies of, any Tax Returns. 

  

SECTION 5.11. _Deletion of Non-Transferred Software_. Purchaser agrees that,
on and following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not use and shall cause
each of its Affiliates not to use any software or computer databases loaded
on the Transferred Equipment or on the equipment of ICX as of the Closing
Date, unless licenses to such software or computer databases are included
in the Transferred Assets or ICX or Purchaser otherwise have the right to use
them pursuant to the Intellectual Property License Agreement or Transition
Services Agreement or otherwise. Purchaser shall, and shall cause ICX to, as
soon as is reasonably practicable, and in any event no later than 45 days
following the Closing Date, delete all such software and computer databases
from any of the Transferred Equipment and ICXs equipment on which it is
installed. 

  

SECTION 5.12. _Use of Seller s Trademarks and Logos._ Except as expressly
provided in the Intellectual Property License Agreement, Purchaser shall not
have the right to use, and shall promptly cease and desist from all use of,
the name "VeriSign" or any trade names, trademarks, identifying logos or
service marks owned by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than as
part of the Transferred Intellectual Property) or employing the word
"VeriSign" or any part or variation of any of the foregoing or any
confusingly similar trade names, trademarks or logos to any of the foregoing
(collectively, the "Sellers Trademarks and Logos") and will use Purchasers
existing (prior to the Closing Date) trade names, trademarks, identifying
logos and services marks or adopt new trade names, trademarks, identifying
logos and service marks related thereto which are not confusingly similar to
Sellers Trademarks and Logos. Without prejudice to Purchasers obligation to
cease and desist from the use of Sellers Trademarks and Logos, Purchaser
shall not use Sellers Trademarks and Logos in any manner that might
dilute, 

  

    ##### 

  

   

tarnish, disparage or reflect adversely on Seller or Sellers Trademarks and
Logos or result in any Liability to Seller. 

  

SECTION 5.13. _Seller Guarantees and Other Credit Support of the Business_.
Following the Closing, Purchaser will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to procure the release by the applicable counterparty, as soon as reasonably
practicable but in no event later than 60 days after the Closing Date, of any
continuing obligation of Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller with respect to
any Assumed Contract, Shared Contract or Contract binding ICX (including any
guarantee or credit support provided by, or any letter of credit posted by,
Seller or any such Seller Subsidiary),  _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchaser shall not be obligated to make any payment or deliver anything
of value to any such counterparty or other third party in order to procure
such release, and, unless otherwise indemnifiable by Seller under _Section
10.01(a)_, will indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the Subsidiaries of
Seller from and against any Loss resulting from or relating to any such
obligation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, following the
Closing, Purchaser will (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (except
for the payment or delivery of anything of value) to procure the release by
the applicable counterparty of any continuing obligation of Seller or any
such Subsidiary of Seller with respect to the guarantees or other credit
support set forth in _Section 5.13 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ and
(b) unless otherwise indemnifiable by Seller under _Section 10.01(a)_,
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and each such Subsidiary of Seller from
and against any Loss resulting from or relating to any continuing obligation
of Seller or any such Subsidiary of Seller with respect to any such guarantee
or other credit support. 

  

SECTION 5.14. _Release of Outgoing Directors and Officers_. Purchaser shall
cause ICX to irrevocably release and discharge, effective as of the Closing
Date, the directors and officers of ICX who will have resigned from their
offices as contemplated in _Section 2.06(b)_ from and against any and all
past, existing or future, claims, demands, obligations and
Liabilities, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, at law or in
equity, arising from or related to any act or omission by any of those
individuals in their capacity of directors or officers of ICX prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that such release and discharge shall be
without prejudice to any rights of Purchaser under _Article X_. 

   

SECTION 5.15. _Retained Litigation_. 

  

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller shall retain full control and
responsibility for the defense, negotiation or settlement of, and any other
action or decision relating to the Actions pending against Seller,
Subsidiaries of Seller and/or ICX in relation to the Business that are listed
in _Section 5.15(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ (collectively, the
"Retained Litigation"). The Retained Litigation includes the "Picturemail
Retained Litigation", the "MDG Retained Litigation" and the "Other Retained
Litigation", in each case as specified on _Section 5.15(a)_ of such Schedule,
and, immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a
supplement to _Section 5.15(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ adding
any Actions commenced after the date hereof that included claims
substantially similar to the claims in such Actions that have been commenced
prior to the date hereof (and "Retained Litigation" shall be deemed to
include any such additional Actions). Notwithstanding the foregoing (or other
provision of this Agreement), Seller shall not settle any Retained Litigation
without Purchasers prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the relief provided by such
settlement would not (i) impose any material obligations or restrictions on
the Business or (ii), in the case the MDG 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Retained Litigation and Other Retained Litigation, impose any Loss on
Purchaser or the Business after the Closing Date that is not indemnifiable by
Seller under _Section 10.01(a)_ or (iii), in the case of the Picturemail
Retained Litigation, impose any Loss on Purchaser or the Business after the
Closing Date in excess of the amount set forth in _Section 10.01(b)(v)_ that
is not indemnifiable by Seller under _Section 10.01(a)_. For the purposes
of determining the indemnification obligations of Seller and Purchaser under
_Section 10.01(a)(vi)_ and _Section 10.01(b)(v)_, respectively, Seller shall
make a reasonable allocation between the pre-Closing and post-Closing periods
of any Loss arising from any settlement of the Picturemail Retained
Litigation. Purchaser may at any time elect to retain separate counsel of its
choice to represent Purchaser and/or any of its Subsidiaries, including ICX,
in connection with any Retained Litigation, and Purchaser shall pay the fees,
charges and disbursements of such counsel; _provided_ _that_ (i) Seller shall
have the right to approve the identity of such counsel, such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (ii) such counsel shall have a
passive and advisory role only and shall not have the right to control any
aspect of the defense or counterclaim (if any) in respect of any Retained
Litigation. 

  

(b) In addition, and without prejudice to Purchasers obligations under
_Section 5.08(b)_ and _Section 5.10_, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates, including ICX, subject to reimbursement of all out-of-pocket
costs incurred by Purchaser and its Affiliates, to: 

   

(i) cooperate and/or provide assistance, as reasonably requested by Seller,
in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any Retained
Litigation; 

   

(ii) cooperate with Sellers requests to modify the operation of
the Picturemail Business as Seller may reasonably deem necessary or advisable
to minimize potential liability under the Picturemail Retained Litigation,
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any unreimbursed Losses incurred
by Purchaser as a result of doing so shall be taken into account for purposes
of _Section 10.01(a)(vi)_ and _Section 10.01(b)(v)_; 

   

(iii) make available to Seller individuals that are employed by Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries in a timely manner to provide testimony through
declarations, affidavits, depositions, or at hearing or trial and to assist
Seller in preparation for such events consistent with deadlines dictated by
particular Retained Litigation; and 

   

(iv) provide Seller with such documents and data relating to the
Business, consistent with deadlines dictated by a particular matter, as
required by legal procedure or court order, or if reasonably requested by
Seller, in relation to any Retained Litigation. 

  

(c) In the event that a final non-appealable judgment is entered in connection
with any Picturemail Retained Litigation (a "Picturemail Judgment") and such
judgment restricts Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser from continuing
to operate the Picturemail Business in substantially the manner that the
Picturemail Business is operated on the date hereof, Seller shall, at
its option and within ninety (90) days from entry of such judgment, either
(i) pay to Purchaser [***] or (ii) deliver to Purchaser a fully paid up
transferable perpetual license (or such other intellectual property rights)
that would permit Purchaser (or such Subsidiary) to 

   

      *******   |   | **Confidential material redacted pursuant to a
request for confidential treatment and filed separately with the Commission.**
  
---|---|---|---|---|--- 
   

   

    ##### 

  

   

continue to operate the Business in such manner. Purchasers rights under this
_Section 5.15(c)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of any Purchaser
Indemnified Person in respect of Losses that arise out of any such
restriction. 

  

SECTION 5.16. _Non-Solicitation_. Seller agrees that for a period of one (1)
year from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates (other than Affiliates that are natural persons) not to, directly
or indirectly, solicit to hire or hire any Transferred Employee, unless such
Person ceased to be an employee of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries prior
to such action by Seller or its Affiliates, or, in the case of such Persons
voluntary termination of employment with Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, at
least three months prior to such action by Seller or its Affiliates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 5.16_ prohibiting solicitation of employment shall not apply to bona
fide general solicitations of, or advertisements for, employment placed by
Seller or its Affiliates that are not specifically targeted at such Persons.
In addition, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (other than Affiliates
that are natural persons) shall directly, or indirectly through another
Person, for so long as Seller shall have continuing obligations under
_Section 5.17_ below, call on, solicit or service any customer, supplier,
licensee, licensor or other business relation of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates in order to induce or attempt to induce such Person to cease doing
business with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates with respect to the
Business, or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such
customer, supplier, licensee or business relation with respect to the
Business and Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including making any negative
statements or communications with respect to the Business about Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates). For purposes of this _Section 5.16_, the term
Affiliate (when used in the context of Seller) shall not include any Person
that, after the Closing Date, acquires control of Seller (an "Acquiring
Person") or any Subsidiary of an Acquiring Person (other than Seller and
its Subsidiaries at the time of such acquisition of control) (an "Acquiring
Person Subsidiary") that does not use information regarding the identities of
Transferred Employees for purposes of taking action that would otherwise be
prohibited by this _Section 5.16_. 

   

SECTION 5.17. _Noncompetition_. 

  

(a) Subject to _Section 5.17(b)_ below, in consideration of Purchaser
entering into this Agreement and in order that Purchaser may enjoy the full
benefit of the Transferred Assets and the Business, for a period from and
after the Closing Date until June 30, 2013 (the "Noncompetition Period"),
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (other than Affiliates that are
natural persons) shall, directly or indirectly, carry on, or participate in,
a business which is directly in competition with the Business (any such
restricted activity, a "Competitive Business");  _provided_ , that for
purposes of this _Section 5.17_, the term Affiliate shall not include any
Acquiring Person or any Acquiring Person Subsidiary so long as neither the
Acquiring Person, any Acquiring Person Subsidiary nor their respective
directors, officers or employees use any Business Confidential Information in
any material respect in connection with any Competitive Business. 

  

(b) Nothing in this _Section 5.17_ shall restrict the right of Seller and its
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly: 

   

(i) continue to operate each of the businesses of Seller other than
the Business (the "Existing Businesses") in substantially the same manner as
the Existing Businesses are currently conducted (including any business
substantially 

 

    ##### 

  

   

similar to an Existing Business acquired by Seller or any of its Affiliates
on or after the Closing Date to the extent such business is thereafter
conducted in substantially the same manner as the Existing Businesses are
currently conducted); 

   

(ii) transfer any Existing Business to any third party (including any
third party engaged in a Competitive Business); 

   

(iii) provide any service or carry out any activity that Seller or
its Subsidiaries will be required to provide or carry out as a result of the
adoption of any consensus policy by the Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers; 

   

(iv) acquire or hold securities of any Person that is engaged in a
Competitive Business, provided that such acquisition or holding of securities
represents a passive investment that does not exceed 20% of the outstanding
voting shares of such Person for Seller or any of its Affiliates and does not
give Seller or any of its Affiliates the right to appoint directors or
management of such Person or to otherwise exercise control over the
management of such Person; or 

   

(v) acquire the majority of the voting securities of any Person, or acquire
the assets of a business, that is engaged in a Competitive Business, provided
that such Competitive Business (A) is terminated or disposed of within twelve
months after completion of such acquisition and (B) represents less than 10%
of the revenues generated by such acquired Person or business. 

  

(c) Seller acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law for any breach, or
threatened breach, of any of the provisions of this _Section 5.17_ will be
inadequate and, accordingly, Seller covenants and agrees that Purchaser
shall, in addition to any other rights and remedies which Purchaser may have
at Law, be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive
relief, and to seek the remedy of specific performance with respect to any
breach or threatened breach of such covenant, as may be available from any
court of competent jurisdiction. Seller hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of a bond in connection with seeking any such
equitable relief. In addition, Seller and Purchaser agree that the terms of
the covenant in this _Section 5.17_ are fair and reasonable in light of
Purchasers plans for the Transferred Assets and the Business and are
necessary to accomplish the full transfer of the goodwill and other
intangible assets contemplated hereby. In the event that any of the covenants
contained in this _Section 5.17_ shall be determined by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, then
any such provision or provisions shall not be deemed void, and the
parties hereto agree that said limits may be modified by the court and that
said covenant contained in this  _Section 5.17_ shall be amended in
accordance with said modification, it being specifically agreed by the
parties that it is their continuing desire that this covenant be enforced to
the full extent of its terms and conditions or if a court finds the scope of
the covenant unenforceable, the court should redefine the covenant so as to
comply with applicable Law. 

  

SECTION 5.18. _UCC Termination Statements_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Purchaser UCC-3 termination
statements or similar 

  

    ##### 

  

   

documents evidencing the termination of all Liens on the Transferred Assets,
other than Permitted Liens. 

  

SECTION 5.19. _Direct Connects_. Seller shall take all actions as specified
in  _Section 5.19 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ to establish
independent "group 1" direct connections for Mobile Enterprise Solutions. In
addition, Purchaser and Seller shall, and Seller shall cause mQube to, enter
into the Connectivity Services Agreement, pursuant to the terms specified in
_Section 5.19 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_. The obligations of
the parties under this _Section 5.19_ shall expire twenty-four (24) months
after the Closing. 

  

ARTICLE VI 

   

EMPLOYEE MATTERS 

    

SECTION 6.01. _Offers and Terms of Employment_. 

  

(a) Seller shall, and shall cause the relevant Subsidiaries of Seller to,
terminate, effective as of the Closing Date, the employment of all the
Employees listed in Part I of _Section 6.01(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_ (such schedule to be updated no later than two weeks prior to the
Closing). No later than three days prior to, and effective as of, the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its applicable Subsidiaries to,
offer employment to each such Employee (each such Employee, an "Offeree").
Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, for any such Employee (an
"Inactive Employee") who is inactive on the Closing Date because of a short-
term disability or by reason of a leave under the Family and Medical Leave
Act (an "FMLA Leave") such termination of employment and offer of employment
shall be effective as of the date such Employee returns to active status, and
shall be subject to such Employee returning to active status not later than
the expiration of such short-term disability benefits or FMLA Leave.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.01(a)_, for
employees located in non-US jurisdictions for whom the transfer of employment
mechanism described above would be inconsistent with local requirements
(each, a "Non-US TE"), employment shall transfer through assumption
of employment contracts or otherwise in compliance with such requirements.
Part II of _Section 6.01(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth the
manner in which the employment of each Non-US TE is intended by the Purchaser
and Seller to be transferred. In the event employment of the Non-US TEs
cannot be transferred as outlined on _Section 6.01(a)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, then an agreement outlining the actual method of
transfer and the allocation of any associated Liabilities shall be created
and negotiated in good faith between Seller and Purchaser, but in all events
shall be consistent with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

(b) Each Offeree who accepts Purchasers or one of its Subsidiaries offer of
employment, together with each non-U.S. Employee whose employment continues
as provided in _Section 6.01(a)_ , shall be referred to herein as a
"Transferred Employee." An Offeree who performs work at his then applicable
place of employment in the Business on the first Business Day
immediately following the Closing Date shall be deemed to have accepted the
offer of employment and to be a Transferred Employee for all purposes of this
Agreement, it being understood and agreed that Purchaser shall have no
obligation to any Transferred Employee who fails to take such action as
may be required of him by local law to commence or continue employment with
Purchaser. Immediately following the Closing, all Transferred Employees
employed in the U.S. will be employed by ICX. Purchaser shall, upon the
request of Seller, 

  

    ##### 

  

   

promptly advise Seller in writing of the terms of employment that were offered
to any Offeree who does not become a Transferred Employee. For the avoidance
of any doubt any Person, who is not an Offeree and who performs services on
behalf of Seller, Seller Subsidiaries, or their Affiliates, for Purchaser and
the Business as part of the Transition Services Agreement shall not be a
deemed a Transferred Employee. 

  

(c) The Parties agree that offers of employment to Transferred Employees may
be subject to such reasonable background and drug screen checks as the
Purchaser shall determine, which checks shall be performed following the
Closing Date (or initial date of employment for Inactive Employees). Neither
Purchaser nor its Affiliates shall have any Liability or responsibility
in respect of any such Employee who fails such checks, and no such Employee
shall be treated as a Transferred Employee hereunder, except that Purchaser
shall bear full responsibility for any Liability relating to the conduct of
the checks or any alleged improprieties in the conduct thereof or in the
Purchasers decision to revoke any offer of employment as a result thereof. 

  

(d) With respect to Employees located in the U.S., Purchaser shall cause each
offer of employment pursuant to _Section 6.01(a)_ to provide for an annual
base salary or hourly wage rate (as applicable), that is the same as such
salary or rate (as applicable) of, or made available to, the relevant Offeree
immediately prior to the Closing Date plus, in the case of Employees located
in the U.S., a one-time increase in such salary or hourly wage rate (as
applicable) equal to the excess of (x) the amount contributed by such Offeree
towards the premium for medical benefits provided by Purchaser in the first
pay period immediately following the Closing Date, over (y) the amount
contributed by such Offeree towards the premium for medical benefits provided
by Seller in the last pay period immediately prior to the Closing Date,
multiplied by twenty-six (the number of pay periods in one fiscal year), and
(i) annual and long-term bonus and incentive compensation opportunities
(other than incentive compensation opportunities related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), (ii) employee and retirement benefits, and
(iii) other terms and conditions of employment (the items in clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) are referred to collectively, as the "Employment Terms") that
are the same as those of a similarly situated employee of Purchaser;
_provided_ , _that_ nothing in this sentence shall restrict the ability of
Purchaser to implement changes to any such Employment Terms, so long as such
changes do not have a materially disproportionate impact on Transferred
Employees as compared to other similarly situated employees of Purchaser; and
_provided_ _further_ , _that_ in the case of any Offeree whose terms and
conditions of employment are subject to collective bargaining or other
collective labor representation (as identified in _Section 3.11(c) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule_), Purchaser shall cause each such offer of
employment (or, where applicable, the continuation of employment) to have
such Employment Terms as may be required under applicable Law or any
applicable collective bargaining or other collective labor agreement. 

  

(e) (i) During the six-month period immediately following the Closing Date or
any longer period required by applicable Law (such period, the "Coverage
Period"), Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, continue to
provide each Transferred Employee located in the U.S. with the annual base
salary or hourly wage rate (as applicable) and Employment Terms in accordance
with  _Section 6.01(d)_. 

  

(ii) _Section 6.01(e)_(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall list the
employment terms and conditions currently provided to all Transferred
Employees located in 

  

    ##### 

  

   

non-U.S. jurisdictions. During the Coverage Period, Purchaser shall, and shall
cause any of its Subsidiaries that employs a Transferred Employee located in
non-U.S. jurisdictions, to provide such Transferred Employees with the same
employment terms and conditions as specified on  _Section 6.01(e)_(ii) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule. 

  

(iii) Nothing in this _Section 6.01(e)_ shall restrict the right of Purchaser
or a Subsidiary of Purchaser to terminate the employment of any Transferred
Employee, provided any such termination is effected in accordance with
applicable Law and the terms of any applicable Purchaser Benefit Plan or
applicable collective agreement or collective bargaining agreement (as
identified in _Section 3.11(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_). 

  

(f) With respect to any Transferred Employee (other than a Transferred
Employee who is covered by a change of control agreement set forth on
_Section 6.02(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule) who, during the
Coverage Period, is terminated without cause, Purchaser shall provide,
or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to provide, severance benefits in an
amount equal to no less than the greater of (i) six weeks base pay of such
Transferred Employee, (ii) the severance benefits such Transferred Employee
would be entitled to receive under Purchasers or such Subsidiarys severance
policies in effect at the time of the Transferred Employees termination
of employment with Purchaser or such Subsidiary, and (iii) the severance
benefits including applicable notice periods such Transferred Employee would
be entitled to receive under (A) Sellers or such Subsidiarys severance
policies or (B) if applicable, Sellers written agreement with
such Transferred Employee, in either case, in effect at the time of the
Closing Date. In the event that the greatest of such three amounts paid to
any such Transferred Employee (other than a Transferred Employee who is
covered by a change of control agreement set forth on _Section 6.02(b)_
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule) is described in clause (iii) above, Seller
shall reimburse Purchaser promptly upon the presentation of appropriate
documentation evidencing such payment and the circumstances thereof, the
excess of the amount (plus the amount of employment taxes actually required
to be paid by Purchaser or its Affiliates, excluding, for the purposes of
clarity, amounts withheld from the payments themselves, in respect of such
amounts) described in clause (iii) over the greater of the amounts described
in clauses (i) and (ii). 

  

(g) If any Transferred Employee identified in _Section 6.01(a)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule as requiring a visa, work permit or employment pass or
other approval for his employment to commence with, or to transfer to or
continue with Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall promptly file any and all necessary applications or
documents and shall take all actions needed to secure the necessary visa,
permit, pass or other approval, and Seller shall provide such assistance as
reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection therewith. 

  

(h) Not later than ten days after the end of each month in the six-month
period following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide Seller with the
information set forth in _Section 6.01(h)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
with respect to each Transferred Employee whose employment with Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries terminated during such month, provided that the
information provided following the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date
shall cover the entire period since the Closing Date. In addition, Purchaser
shall promptly provide Seller with such information as Seller shall
reasonably request regarding the circumstances related to the termination of
employment of any such Transferred Employee. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

SECTION 6.02. _Assumption of Liabilities_. 

  

(a) Subject to _Section 6.02(b)_ and _Section 6.02(c)_, effective from and
after the Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall assume and be solely
responsible for all employment and employee benefits-related Liabilities that
arise on or after the Closing Date and that relate to Purchasers employment,
from and after the Closing Date, of any Transferred Employee (or
any dependent or beneficiary of such Transferred Employee) and, except as
expressly provided herein, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
have any Liability with respect to any such Transferred Employee (or any
dependent or beneficiary of such Transferred Employee) that relates to such
Transferred Employees employment with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. 

  

(b) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall be responsible for, and Purchaser and
its Affiliates shall not assume, honor, pay, perform, or reimburse Seller and
its Subsidiaries for, any Liabilities of Seller, or any of its Subsidiaries,
that have accrued, been incurred, or arise before the Closing Date, to or in
respect of any Transferred Employee, including, but not limited to, earned
but unpaid salaries, bonuses (including annual and transaction stay bonuses),
vacation pay, sick pay, holiday pay, severance pay and other like obligations
and payments, Seller equity awards (all of the foregoing which Seller shall
have the sole obligation to extinguish as applicable, and pay out to any
Transferred Employee); _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall assume
all Liability for (i) accrued but unused vacation time where such
Liability is required to be assumed by operation of Law, (ii) under any
change in control agreements with Transferred Employees set forth on _Section
6.02(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, (iii) as provided in Part II of
_Section 6.01(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_. 

  

(c) (i) Subject to compliance by Purchaser with its obligations under _Section
6.01_ hereof, as applicable to non-U.S. Transferred Employees and U.S.
Employees respectively, from and after the Closing, Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall be solely responsible for any and all Liabilities arising
in connection with any actual or threatened claim by any non-U.S.
Transferred Employee or U.S. Employee who does not become a Transferred
Employee, that his employment in connection with the Business or otherwise
with Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has been actually or constructively
terminated as a direct or indirect result of or otherwise in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

(ii) Purchaser shall be solely responsible for any and all Liabilities arising
in connection with any actual or threatened claim by any U.S. Transferred
Employee that his employment in connection with the Business or otherwise
with Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has been actually or constructively
terminated as a direct or indirect result of or otherwise in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

(d) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this _Article VI_, effective
from and after the Closing Date, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall remain
responsible for any and all employment and employee benefits-related
Liabilities of Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or any Seller Benefit Plan
incurred or arising out of any period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, to or in respect of any current or former employee of the Business (or
any dependent or beneficiary of such employee). 

  

(e) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, pay the Transferred
Employees in respect of annual bonus for the period prior to the Closing Date
such amounts as 

  

    ##### 

  

   

are determined by Seller to be payable, as set forth in a schedule to be
provided by Seller to Purchaser, net of any tax withholdings required in
respect of such payments. Seller shall, not later than 5 Business Days prior
to the date such payments are to be made (as specified by Seller in such
schedule), pay to Purchaser the aggregate of such amounts plus the amount of
employment taxes actually required to be paid by Purchaser or its Affiliates
(excluding, for the purposes of clarity, amounts withheld from the payments
themselves) in respect of such amounts. (For the avoidance of doubt, in
determining the "employment taxes actually required to be paid," if an amount
required to be paid pursuant to this _Section 6.02(e)_ is in excess of the
wages subject to employment taxes already paid in the applicable year (such
as amounts required to be paid in excess of wages subject to the non-HI
portion of FICA taxes), such amount will not be treated as subject to an
employment tax.). 

  

(f) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, pay the Transferred
Employees in respect of any of Sellers Sales Compensation Plans for the
calendar quarter commencing prior to the Closing Date and ending after the
Closing date such amounts as are determined by Seller to be payable, as set
forth in a schedule to be provided by Seller to Purchaser, net of any
tax withholdings required in respect of such payments. Seller shall, not
later than 5 Business Days prior to the date such payments are to be made (as
specified by Seller in such schedule), pay to Purchaser the aggregate of such
amounts plus the amount of employment taxes actually required to be paid by
Purchaser or its Affiliates (excluding, for the purposes of clarity, amounts
withheld from the payments themselves) in respect of such amounts. 

   

SECTION 6.03. _Union Employees and Plans._  

  

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of
its Subsidiaries to, (i) recognize each collective bargaining or other labor
representative identified in  _Section 3.11(c) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_ then representing any of the Transferred Employees, and (ii) assume
each collective bargaining or other collective labor agreement identified in
_Section 3.11(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ covering any
Transferred Employees or the terms and condition of employment of any
Transferred Employees. From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, assume, honor, pay and perform all of the
Liabilities and obligations under or in respect of each such
collective bargaining or other collective labor agreement in accordance with
the terms thereof as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date or as
the same may thereafter be amended in accordance with its terms, including
all such Liabilities and obligations of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

(b) Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate and take all reasonably necessary or
appropriate actions with respect to any requirement under applicable Law or
any applicable agreement to notify the collective bargaining or other labor
representatives of the Employees of this Agreement and/or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any applicable works council, and to provide
such information and engage in such notifications, discussions or
negotiations with such representatives as may be required by applicable Law
or any applicable agreement. 

   

SECTION 6.04. _Participation in Purchaser Benefit Plans_. 

  

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, except as otherwise provided in this
_Article VI_, each Transferred Employee shall cease to participate in any
Seller Benefit Plan (other 

  

    ##### 

  

   

than as a former employee of Seller and its Subsidiaries to the extent, if
any, permitted by the terms of such Seller Benefit Plan). Effective from and
after the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to, establish or have in effect Benefit Plans for the benefit of
the Transferred Employees (and their dependents and beneficiaries) in
accordance with the requirements of this _Article VI_ and Purchasers and
its Subsidiaries offers of employment. 

  

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
applicable Subsidiaries to, recognize the service of the Transferred
Employees prior to the Closing Date with Seller or any of its Affiliates and
any of their respective predecessors as service with Purchaser for all
purposes under Purchaser Benefit Plans, including eligibility to participate,
vesting, level of benefits and, for purposes of severance and vacation
benefits, benefit accrual, except to the extent the recognition of such
service would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of
service. From and after the Closing Date, each Transferred Employee shall
immediately be eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all Purchaser Benefit Plans. With respect to any Purchaser Benefit Plan that
is a medical, dental, or other health plan, Purchaser shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive or cause to be waived any pre-
existing condition exclusions and requirements that would result in a lack of
coverage of any pre-existing condition of a Transferred Employee (or any
dependent thereof) that would have been covered under the Seller Benefit Plan
in which such Transferred Employee (or eligible and enrolled
dependent thereof) was a participant immediately prior to the Closing Date,
and credit or cause to be credited any time accrued against applicable
waiting periods relating to such pre-existing condition and (ii) waive any
health eligibility, actively-at-work or medical examination requirements
under such plans. 

  

(c) Purchaser agrees to cause its tax-qualified defined contribution plan for
U.S. employees to allow each Transferred Employee who has one or more account
balances in Sellers tax-qualified 401(k) plan to make a "direct rollover" of
such account balances (including promissory notes evidencing all outstanding
loans) from Sellers defined contribution plan if such Transferred Employee
elects to make such a rollover. 

  

SECTION 6.05. _WARN Act Compliance_. The parties agree to cooperate in good
faith to determine whether any notification may be required under the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, as amended (the "WARN Act"), and
any similar Law. Purchaser agrees to provide any required notice under the
WARN Act, and any similar Law, and to otherwise comply with the WARN Act and
any such other similar Law with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass
layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar event
affecting Transferred Employees (including as a result of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and occurring from and after
the Closing. Seller shall comply with the WARN Act or any similar Law with
respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act)
or group termination or similar event affecting Employees (including as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) and occurring prior to the Closing. During the 90-day
period immediately following the Closing, Purchaser agrees to not take and to
cause its Subsidiaries not to take, any action that would, alone or in the
aggregate, cause the termination of any Employee that occurs on or before the
Closing Date to constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" or
group termination under the WARN Act or any similar Law, or creates any
Liability or penalty to Seller for any employment terminations under
applicable Law. On the Closing Date, Seller shall notify Purchaser of any
"employment loss" (as that term is defined in the WARN Act) of any Employees
in the 90-day period prior to the Closing. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

SECTION 6.06. _No Amendments or Third-Party Beneficiaries._  

  

(a) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) constitute or be deemed to
be an amendment to any Purchaser Benefit Plan or Seller Benefit Plan or (ii)
require Purchaser to amend, modify, affect, or terminate any Purchaser
Benefit Plan (other than as may be required to reflect the obligations of
Purchaser set forth in _Article VI_). 

  

(b) The provisions of this _Article VI_ are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person
(including for the avoidance of doubt any Employee), other than the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided
for in this _Article VI_) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE VII 

   

TAX MATTERS 

   

SECTION 7.01. _Transfer Taxes_. Seller and Purchaser agree that all Transfer
Taxes imposed by any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Transactions, shall be borne
equally by Seller (or its applicable Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and
Purchaser (or its applicable Subsidiaries), on the other hand, whether levied
on Seller, Purchaser or any of their Subsidiaries. In the event that any such
Transfer Taxes are required under applicable Law to be collected, remitted or
paid by one party or any of its Subsidiaries or any agent thereof (as
requested by such party or any of its Subsidiaries), the other party
shall (on behalf of itself and of its applicable Subsidiaries) pay half the
amount of such Transfer Taxes to the first mentioned party, any of its
Subsidiaries or any such agent, as applicable, at the Closing or thereafter,
as applicable, as requested of or by the first mentioned
party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all payments due to Seller shall be
made without any deduction or withholding on account of any Taxes, except as
required by applicable Law in which case the sum payable by Purchaser in
respect of which such deduction or withholding is to be made shall
be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after making such
deduction or withholding, Seller receives and retains (free from any
Liability in respect thereof) a net sum equal to the sum it would have
received but for such deduction or withholding being required. 

  

SECTION 7.02. _Tax Characterization of Adjustments_. Seller and Purchaser
agree to treat, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to treat, all
payments made either to or for the benefit of the other under any indemnity
provisions of this Agreement and for any misrepresentations or breach of
warranty or covenants as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes
and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof. 

  

SECTION 7.03. _Parties  Responsibility_. Subject to _Section 7.01_, Seller,
or a relevant Subsidiary of Seller, as applicable, is and shall remain solely
responsible for all Tax matters arising from or relating to the Business, ICX
and/or the Transferred Assets through the Closing. Purchaser, or a relevant
Subsidiary of Purchaser, as applicable, shall be solely responsible for all
Tax matters arising from or relating to the Business, ICX and/or
the Transferred Assets after the Closing. In the case of any Straddle Period,
the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the
Business, ICX and/or the Transferred 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Assets for the portion of the Straddle Period up to and through the Closing
shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as though the
Taxable period of the Business ended on the Closing. The amount of other
Taxes of the Business for the portion of the Straddle Period up to and
through the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period. The
parties shall cooperate with each other concerning all Tax matters. 

   

SECTION 7.04. _Tax Returns_. 

  

(a) Seller shall be responsible for the timely filing (taking into account any
extensions received from the relevant tax authorities) of all Tax Returns
required by Law to be filed by, or with respect to, ICX in respect of any
period ending on or before the Closing. Such Tax Returns shall be true,
correct and complete in all material respects, and all Taxes indicated as due
and payable on such Tax Returns shall be paid or will be paid by Seller as
and when required by Law. 

  

(b) Purchaser shall be responsible for the timely filing (taking into account
any extensions received from the relevant Tax authorities) of all Tax Returns
required by Law to be filed by, or with respect to, ICX in respect of any
period ending after the Closing Date, it being understood that all taxes
indicated as due and payable on such Tax Returns shall be the responsibility
of Purchaser, except for such Taxes which are the responsibility of Seller
pursuant to _Section 7.03_. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with those prepared for prior taxable periods unless a different
treatment of any item is required by an intervening change in Law. 

  

(c) Seller shall be entitled to review and comment on any Tax Return for ICX
for any taxable period that is a Straddle Period before it is filed.
Purchaser shall submit a draft of any such Tax Return to Seller at least 90
days before the date such Tax Return is required to be filed with the
relevant Tax authority. Seller shall have 30 days after the date of receipt
thereof to submit to Purchaser in writing Sellers comments with respect to
such Tax Return. Purchaser shall notify Seller within 15 days after receipt
of such comments of (a) the extent, if any, to which Purchaser accepts such
comments and will file such Tax Return in accordance therewith and (b) the
extent, if any, to which Purchaser rejects such comments. 

  

(d) To the extent Purchaser rejects comments of Seller, Purchaser and Seller
shall, within 10 days, appoint an independent public accounting firm of
nationally recognized standing that does not then audit the books of
Purchaser, Seller or any relevant Subsidiary to determine the correct manner
for reporting the items that are in dispute. Seller and Purchaser agree
promptly to provide to such accounting firm all relevant information, and
such accounting firm shall have 30 days to submit its determination. The
determination of such accounting firm shall be binding upon the parties and
Purchaser shall file such Tax Return in accordance therewith. The fees and
expenses of such accounting firm shall be paid one-half by Seller and one-
half by Purchaser. 

  

(e) Except as required by Law, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
will amend, re-file, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax
election of, or in respect of, ICX or the Transferred Assets with respect to
a pre-Closing Tax period or Straddle Period without the prior written consent
of Seller. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 10.02(b)_, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to conduct the defense of and settle any third
party claims related to Taxes. 

  

SECTION 7.05. _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. Seller and Purchaser shall
effect, or cause to be effected, the timely filing of a completed Form 8023
and shall take such other steps, including those required by Form 8023 and
Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1, as may be necessary to make
effective elections pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and
any corresponding election under state or local law) with respect to ICX.
Seller shall prepare Form 8883 and similar forms for purposes of state and
local taxation concurrently with the preparation of the Allocation Schedule
in accordance with _Section 2.03(d)_, and the parties shall take such other
actions required pursuant to the Treasury Regulations under Section 338(h)(10)
of the Code to report the allocation of the portion of the Purchase Price and
Assumed Liabilities with respect to the Shares as allocable thereto in a
manner consistent with the principles of  _Section 2.03_ (the "ICX Purchase
Price Allocation"). The procedures set forth in  _Section 2.03(d)_,
including the use of an Accounting Arbitrator, shall also govern any dispute
and the resolution thereof with respect to the final _ICX Purchase Price_
Allocation. For all Tax purposes (except with respect to Tax Returns the
timely filing of which may not be extended, without the imposition of
penalties, until after the _ICX Purchase Price Allocation_ has been
finalized), Purchaser and Seller agree (i) to report, and cause
their respective Subsidiaries to report, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in a manner consistent in all material respects with the final
_ICX Purchase Price Allocation_ , which shall be binding upon Purchaser and
Seller and their respective Subsidiaries and (ii) not to take any position
inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return, Tax filing (including filings
required under Sections 1060 and 338 of the Code), audit, refund claim or
otherwise. 

  

SECTION 7.06. _Refunds and Tax Benefits_. Purchaser shall promptly pay to
Seller an amount equal to any refund or credit (including any interest paid
or credited with respect thereto) received by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates in connection with the Transferred Assets, the Business or ICX (i)
relating to Taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and,
with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such period ending on the
Closing Date or (ii) attributable to any Tax pre-paid by Seller, or its
Affiliates, for Taxable periods, or the portions thereof, ending after the
Closing Date. Purchaser shall, if requested, by Seller and at
Sellers expense, cause the relevant entity to file for and obtain any refund
or credit which would give rise to a payment under this _Section 7.06_.
Purchaser shall permit Seller to control the prosecution of any such refund
claim, and shall cause the relevant entity to authorize by appropriate power
of attorney such person as Seller shall designate to represent such entity
with respect to such refund claim.

prior to the Closing (except as limited as to time in the case of paragraph
(b) below): 

   

(a) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser; 

  

(b) by Seller or Purchaser, upon prior written notice to the other party, if
the Closing shall not have occurred prior to June 30, 2010 (the "Termination
Date"); except that if, as of such date, any one or more of the conditions
set forth in _Section 8.01(a)_, 8.01(b) or 8.01(c) shall not have been
satisfied but all other conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ shall have
been satisfied or, for those conditions intended to be satisfied at the
Closing, shall be capable of being satisfied, the Termination Date may be
extended once by either party until October 31, 2010, in which case all
references to the Termination Date shall be to the Termination Date as
so extended; 

  

(c) by Seller, upon prior written notice to Purchaser, in the event a
condition set forth in  _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.02_ has not been
satisfied, is not reasonably capable of being satisfied and has not been
waived by Seller, on or prior to the Termination Date; or 

  

(d) by Purchaser, upon prior written notice to Seller, in the event a
condition set forth in  _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.03_ has not been
satisfied, is not reasonably capable of being satisfied and has not been
waived by Purchaser, on or prior to the Termination Date. 

   

Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.01_ to the contrary, the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c) or (d) above shall
not be available to any party whose breach of any provision under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the event or condition
purportedly giving rise to a right to terminate this Agreement under such
paragraph prior to the Closing. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

SECTION 9.02. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Article IX_, this Agreement shall be null
and void and of no further force and effect, except as set forth in this
_Section 9.02_, _Section 9.03_ and  _Article XI_ (other than _Section
11.13_), all of which shall survive any such termination, and there shall be
no liability or obligation on the part of any party, except with respect to
any Losses incurred or suffered by a party that were the result of fraud or
intentional breach of this Agreement prior to termination. 

   

SECTION 9.03. _Termination Fee_. 

  

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by (i) Purchaser pursuant to _Section
9.01(d)_ as a result of either or both of the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.01(a)_ or _Section 8.01(b)_ not being satisfied or becoming
incapable of being satisfied when all other conditions set forth in _Article
VIII_ have been satisfied or, for those conditions intended to be satisfied
at the Closing, shall be capable of being satisfied, (ii) Seller pursuant to
_Section 9.01(c)_ as a result of (A) a material uncured breach by Purchaser
of its obligations under  _Section 5.04_ and/or (B) either or both of the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.01(a)_ or _Section 8.01(b)_ not being
satisfied or becoming incapable of being satisfied when all other conditions
set forth in _Article VIII_ have been satisfied or, for those conditions
intended to be satisfied at the Closing, shall be capable of being satisfied
or (iii) either Purchaser or Seller pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)_ and, at
the time of such termination pursuant to this clause (iii) either or both of
the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01(a)_ or _Section 8.01(b)_ shall
not have been satisfied but all other conditions set forth in  _Article
VIII_ shall have been satisfied or, for those conditions intended to be
satisfied at the Closing, shall be capable of being satisfied, then Purchaser
shall pay to Seller no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the fifth (5th)
Business Day following such termination a termination fee of $17,500,000 (the
"Termination Fee"); _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this
_Section 9.03(a)_, a party shall not be entitled to assert that a
condition precedent set forth in _Article VIII_ has not been satisfied or
has become incapable of being satisfied (and such party therefore shall not
be entitled to receive the Termination Fee or shall be required to pay the
Termination Fee, as the case may be) if the event or condition causing
the condition precedent not to be satisfied is caused by or the result of
such partys bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence or material
uncured breach of any covenant set forth herein, including without limitation
the covenant set forth in _Section 5.04(b)_ as well as any other covenant in
_Section 5.04_. 

  

(b) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that the amounts (if any) payable pursuant to _Section 9.03(a)_
are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Seller in the circumstances in which such
termination fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, Seller would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Purchaser fails to timely pay the
Termination Fee, when due in accordance with this _Section 9.03_, and, in
order to obtain such payment, Seller commences a suit that results in a
judgment against Purchaser for the amounts set forth in this _Section 9.03_,
Purchaser shall pay to Seller its reasonable and documented costs
and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit.

officers and directors (collectively the "Purchaser Indemnified Persons")
that arise out of: 

   

(i) any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of Sellers representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement (disregarding, for purposes of

occurred, any materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" qualification
contained therein);

SECTION 10.02. _Notice of Claim; Defense_. 

  

(a) If (i) any third party or Governmental Authority institutes, threatens or
asserts any Action that may give rise to Losses for which a party (an
"Indemnifying Party") may be liable for indemnification under this _Article
X_ (a "Third-Party Claim") or (ii) any Person entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement (an "Indemnified Party") shall have a claim to be
indemnified by an Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party
Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly send to the Indemnifying
Party a written notice specifying the nature of such claim and a good faith
estimate of the amount of all related Losses (a "Claim Notice"). The
Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its indemnification obligations under
this _Article X_ only if (and then only to the extent that) it is actually
prejudiced by the failure of the Indemnified Parties to provide a timely and
adequate Claim Notice. 

  

(b) In the event of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may elect to
retain counsel of its choice to represent such Indemnified Parties in
connection with such Action and shall pay the fees, charges and disbursements
of such counsel so long as the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified
Party, within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of
the Third-Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party, that the Indemnifying Party
is assuming the defense against (or settlement of) such Third Party Claim and
will indemnify the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim in its
name or, if necessary, in the name of the Indemnified Party in accordance
with the terms and limitations of this _Article X_; _provided_ , that (i)
the Indemnified Parties and their counsel shall reasonably cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in connection with such Action and (ii)
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the conduct and
control of such settlement and defense if (A) the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (B) the
Indemnified Party is advised by counsel chosen by it that there are one
or more defenses available to the Indemnified Party which the Indemnifying
Party has not or cannot assert on behalf of the Indemnified Party, (C) the
Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend
such claim, or (D) a conflict exists with respect to the counsel retained by
the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such
Action without the relevant Indemnified Parties prior written consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless (1) the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are entirely paid or reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party, (2) there is no finding or admission of any violation of
applicable law and (3) such settlement includes an unconditional release from
all liability with respect to such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Indemnifying Party elects not to retain counsel and assume control of
such defense or is otherwise not entitled to do so in accordance with this
_Section 10.02_, then the Indemnified Parties shall assume control of the
defense in connection with such Action, and the fees, charges and
disbursements of no more than one such counsel per jurisdiction selected by
the Indemnified Parties shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party. Under
no circumstances will the Indemnifying Party have any liability in connection
with any settlement of any Action that is entered into without its prior
written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The
foregoing provisions of this  _Section 10.02(b)_ shall not apply to any
Third-Party Claim that alleges conduct for which both Seller and Purchaser
would be an "Indemnifying Party" under _Section 10.01(a)(iii)_ or  _(iv)_
(with respect to Seller) and _Section 10.01(b)(iii)_ or _(iv)_ (with respect
to Purchaser). In any such case, each of Seller and Purchaser shall, at its
cost and expense, assume and control the defense of the portion of such
Third-Party Claim related to conduct for which such party would be so
required to provide indemnity. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice, at the reasonable request
of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel, experts and representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to the books, records, personnel and
properties of the Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the
Claim Notice at no cost to the Indemnifying Party (other than for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses of the Indemnified Parties). 

  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 10.02_ are subject to the terms of
_Section 5.15_ and _Section 7.04(f)_. 

  

SECTION 10.03. _No Duplication; Exclusive Remedy_. (a) Any liability
for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without duplication of
recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability
constituting a Transferred Asset, an Assumed Liability, an Excluded Asset, a
Retained Liability or a Liability relating to the Retained Litigation, or a
breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement,
as applicable. 

  

(b) From and after the Closing, the exclusive remedy of the Indemnified
Persons in connection with this Agreement, the Contribution Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (whether under this contract or
arising under common law or any other Law) shall be as provided in this
_Article X_; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this  _Article X_
shall limit in any way either partys remedies in respect of intentional fraud
by the other party in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
In addition, nothing in this _Section 10.03(b)_ shall operate to interfere
with or impede the operation of the provisions of _Section 2.04_, _Section
5.15_, _Article VII_ or the Parties right to seek equitable remedies
(including specific performance or injunctive relief) to enforce  _Section
5.03_, _Section 5.15_, _Section 5.16_ and _Section 5.17_. 

  

SECTION 10.04. _Limitation on Set-off_. Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall
have any right to set off any unresolved indemnification claim pursuant to
this _Article X_ against any payment due pursuant to _Article II_. 

  

SECTION 10.05. _Mitigation_. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each
other with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which
one party is obligated to indemnify the other party under this _Article X_,
including by making reasonable best efforts to mitigate, whether by seeking
claims against a third party, an insurer or otherwise. 

  

ARTICLE XI 

   

GENERAL PROVISIONS 

   

SECTION 11.01. _Waiver_. Either party may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to
be bound thereby. Any failure to assert, or delay in the assertion of, rights
under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

SECTION 11.02. _Expenses_.

Agreements, the parties shall bear their respective direct and indirect costs

SECTION 11.04. _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

SECTION 11.05. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
applicable Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the

shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a

between Seller and Purchaser with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

  

SECTION 11.07. _Assignment_. Except as explicitly provided herein, neither
party may directly or indirectly transfer any of its rights or delegate any
of its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other
party; _provided_ , that, following the Closing, Purchaser may assign any of
its rights under this Agreement to any Person that succeeds to substantially
all of the assets of any Business Component, but no such assignment shall
relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Any
purported transfer or delegation in violation of this _Section 11.07_ shall
be null and void. 

  

SECTION 11.08. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the rights of
Purchaser Indemnified Persons and Seller Indemnified Persons under _Article
X_, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties and their permitted
assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy

or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the
manner provided in _Section 11.03_ or any other manner as may be permitted by
Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof, and (v) agrees that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Law. The preceding sentence shall not limit the
jurisdiction of the Accounting Arbitrator set forth in _Section 2.04_,
although claims described in the preceding sentence may be asserted in such
courts for purposes of enforcing the jurisdiction and judgments of
the Accounting Arbitrator. 

  

(c) Each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation

SECTION 11.13. _Availability of Equitable Relief_. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof. Accordingly
in the event of any breach or threatened breach by a party of its obligations
under this Agreement, the affected party shall be entitled to equitable
relief (including specific performance of the terms hereof) without prejudice
to any other rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to such other
party. 

  

SECTION 11.14. _Time of Essence_. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees
that, with regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in
this Agreement, time is of the essence. 

  

SECTION 11.15. _Construction of Agreements_. Notwithstanding any other
provisions in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event and to the extent
that there shall be a conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and
the provisions of any Ancillary Agreement entered into by Seller and
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall
control (unless the Ancillary Agreement explicitly provides otherwise). 

 

    #####
