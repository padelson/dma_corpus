Third-Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party, that the Indemnifying Party is assuming the defense
against (or settlement of) such Third Party Claim and will indemnify the Indemnified Party against
such Third Party Claim in its name or, if necessary, in the name of the Indemnified Party in
accordance with the terms and limitations of this <U>Article&nbsp;X</U>; <U>provided</U>, that (i)&nbsp;the
Indemnified Parties and their counsel shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and
its counsel in connection with such Action and (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume the conduct and control of such settlement and defense if (A)&nbsp;the claim for indemnification
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation, (B)&nbsp;the Indemnified Party is advised by counsel chosen by it that there are one or
more defenses available to the Indemnified Party which the Indemnifying Party has not or cannot
assert on behalf of the Indemnified Party, (C)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to
vigorously prosecute or defend such claim, or (D)&nbsp;a conflict exists with respect to the counsel
retained by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such Action
without the relevant Indemnified Parties&#146; prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), unless (1)&nbsp;the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are entirely
paid or reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party, (2)&nbsp;there is no finding or admission of any violation
of applicable law and (3)&nbsp;such settlement includes an unconditional release from all liability with
respect to such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnifying Party elects not to
retain counsel and assume control of such defense or is otherwise not entitled to do so in
accordance with this <U>Section&nbsp;10.02</U>, then the Indemnified Parties shall assume control of
the defense in connection with such Action, and the fees, charges and disbursements of no more than
one such counsel per jurisdiction selected by the Indemnified Parties shall be reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party. Under no circumstances will the Indemnifying Party have any liability in
connection with any settlement of any Action that is entered into without its prior written consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The foregoing provisions of this
<U>Section&nbsp;10.02(b)</U> shall not apply to any Third-Party Claim that alleges conduct for which
both Seller and Purchaser would be an &#147;Indemnifying Party&#148; under <U>Section&nbsp;10.01(a)(iii)</U> or
<U>(iv)</U> (with respect to Seller) and <U>Section&nbsp;10.01(b)(iii)</U> or <U>(iv)</U> (with
respect to Purchaser). In any such case, each of Seller and Purchaser shall, at its cost and
expense, assume and control the defense of the portion of such Third-Party Claim related to conduct
for which such party would be so required to provide indemnity.
