pursuant to such discussions between Seller and Buyer shall thereafter be
deemed the "Estimated Closing Recapture Settlement Statement" for all purposes
hereunder; provided, however, that if Buyer and Seller do not reach agreement
with respect to any such corrections during such seven (7) day period for any
reason, then the estimated recapture settlement statement delivered by Seller
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.03(c) shall be the "Estimated
Closing Recapture Settlement Statement" for all purposes hereunder and in no
event shall any such disagreements prevent or delay the Closing.. The
Estimated Closing Date Net Monthly Settlement Balances and the Estimated
Closing Date Recapture Payments will be paid to HLIKK at the Closing pursuant
to the terms of the Recapture Agreements, the 3-Wins Reinsurance Agreement
Amendment and Section 3.03, and will be subject to the Post-Closing Recapture
Payment Adjustment and the Post-Closing Net Monthly Settlement Balance
Adjustment pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.04(m) and Section 2.04(n),
respectively. Not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer will prepare and deliver to Seller a notice setting forth the amount of
Japanese Yen cash and United States Dollars cash that HLIC shall be required
to pay HLIKK in connection with the payment of the Recapture Payment pursuant
to the HLIC Recapture Agreement to the extent the Fair Market Value of the
securities included in the Eligible Recapture Assets to be transferred to
HLIKK in connection with the payment of such Recapture Payment is less than
the amount of such Recapture Payment.

Section 2.04 Adjustment to Payment at Closing.

(a) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare and
deliver to Seller a balance sheet of HLIKK as of the Effective Time in
substantially the same form as the Estimated Closing Pro Forma Balance Sheet
(the "Closing Date Balance Sheet"). The Closing Date Balance Sheet will be
prepared in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles.

(b) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare and
deliver to Seller a recapture settlement statement in substantially the same
form as the Estimated Closing Recapture Settlement Statement, which shall (i)
set forth a calculation of each Net Monthly

 Settlement Balance as of the Effective Time (each, a "Closing Date Net Monthly
Settlement Balance") and the Recapture Payment with respect to the HLIC
Recapture Agreement as of the Effective Time (the "Closing Date HLIC Recapture
Payment") and (ii) include a list of the Eligible Recapture Assets, including
the amount of cash, transferred on the Closing Date to HLIKK in connection
with the settlement pursuant to the HLIC Recapture Agreement, which list shall
specify the Fair Market Value of each such Eligible Recapture Asset as of the
Effective Time (the "Closing Date Recapture Settlement Statement"). The
Closing Date Recapture Settlement Statement will be prepared in accordance
with the Recapture Settlement Statement Methodologies.

(c) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare and
deliver to Seller a report (the "Closing Date VIF Report") setting forth
Milliman's calculation of the VIF as of the Effective Time calculated in
accordance with the VIF Calculation Principles (the "Closing Date VIF
Amount").

(d) If Buyer does not deliver the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Closing Date
Recapture Settlement Statement or the Closing Date VIF Report to Seller within
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, then, at the election of Seller,
either (i) Seller may prepare and present the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the
Closing Date Recapture Settlement Statement and Closing Date VIF Report within
an additional ninety (90) days thereafter or (ii) if Seller elects not to
prepare, then the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, Estimated Closing Recapture
Settlement Statement, Estimated Closing Date Net Monthly Settlement Balances,
Estimated Closing Date Recapture Payments, Estimated Closing Date Net Worth
and Pre-Closing VIF Amount will be deemed to be the Final Balance Sheet, Final
Recapture Settlement Statement, Final Net Monthly Settlement Balances, Final
HLIC Recapture Payment and Final Net Worth in accordance with Section 2.04(i)
and the Final VIF Amount in accordance with Section 2.04(k). If Seller elects
to prepare the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Closing Date Recapture Settlement
Statement or Closing Date VIF Report in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence, then all subsequent references in this Section 2.04 (other
than those in Section 2.04(f), (h), (j), (l), or (m)) to Seller, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, will be deemed to be references to Buyer,
on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, respectively. In connection
with Buyer's preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Closing Date
Recapture Settlement Statement and the Closing Date VIF Report, to the extent
that Buyer or its Representatives do not have all relevant information in
their possession, Buyer and its Representatives will be permitted to review
Seller's work papers and any work papers of Seller's independent accountants
relating to the preparation of the Estimated Closing Pro Forma Balance Sheet
and the Estimated Closing Recapture Settlement Statement, and Seller will make
reasonably available the individuals then in its employ, if any, responsible
for and knowledgeable about the preparation of the Estimated Closing Pro Forma
Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Recapture Settlement Statement in
order to respond to the reasonable inquiries of Buyer; provided, however, that
the independent accountants of Seller will not be obligated to make any work
papers available to Buyer unless and until Buyer has signed a customary
agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such accountants.

(e) During the sixty (60) day period immediately following Seller's receipt of
the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Closing Date Recapture Settlement Statement
and the Closing Date VIF Report (the "Review Period"), Seller and its
Representatives will be permitted to review

 Buyer's work papers and the work papers of Buyer's independent accountants and
Milliman relating to the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Closing Date
Recapture Settlement Statement and the Closing Date VIF Report, as well as all
the books, records and other relevant information relating to the operations
and finances of HLIKK with respect to the period up to and including the
Effective Time, including the VIF Data, and Buyer will make reasonably
available the individuals then in its or its Representatives' (including
Milliman's) employ responsible for and knowledgeable about the information
used in, and the preparation of, the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Closing
Date Recapture Settlement Statement and the Closing Date VIF Report in order
to respond to the reasonable inquiries of Seller; provided, however, that the
independent accountants of Buyer will not be obligated to make any work papers
available to Seller unless and until Seller has signed a customary agreement
relating to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such accountants. Buyer and Seller shall, and Buyer shall cause
Milliman to, each cooperate with each other in the preparation and review of
the Closing Date VIF Report, including providing all relevant information
relating to the operations and finances of HLIKK, including the VIF Data.

(f) Buyer agrees that, following the Closing through the date that the Final
Net Worth, Final Net Monthly Settlement Balances, Final HLIC Recapture Payment
and Final VIF Amount become final and binding, it will not take any actions
with respect to any accounting, books, records, policies or procedures on
which the Financial Statements, the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Closing
Date Recapture Settlement Statement and the Closing Date VIF Report are based
or, if applicable, on which the Final Balance Sheet, the Final Recapture
Settlement Statement and the Final VIF Amount are to be based that would
impede or delay the determination of the Closing Date Net Worth, the Final Net
Worth, the Closing Date Net Monthly Settlement Balances, the Closing Date HLIC
Recapture Payment, the Final Net Monthly Settlement Balances, the Final HLIC
Recapture Payment, the Final VIF Amount or the preparation of the Notice of
Disagreement, the Final Balance Sheet or the Final Recapture Settlement
Statement in the manner and utilizing the methods contemplated by this
Agreement.

(g) Seller will notify Buyer in writing (the "Notice of Disagreement") prior
to the expiration of the Review Period if Seller disagrees with the Closing
Date Balance Sheet, the Closing Date Recapture Settlement Statement or the
Closing Date VIF Report. The Notice of Disagreement will set forth in
reasonable detail the basis for such dispute, the amounts involved and
Seller's determination of the amount of Closing Date Net Worth, the Closing
Date Net Monthly Settlement Balances, the Closing Date HLIC Recapture Payment
or the Closing Date VIF Amount, as applicable. If no Notice of Disagreement is
received by Buyer prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the
Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Recapture Settlement Statement
will be deemed to have been accepted by Seller and will become final and
binding upon the parties in accordance with Section 2.04(i) and the Closing
Date VIF Report will be deemed to have been accepted by Seller and will become
final and binding upon the parties in accordance with Section 2.04(k).

(h) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement (the "Consultation Period"), Seller and Buyer will seek in
good faith to resolve

 any differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in
the Notice of Disagreement.

(i) If, at the end of the Consultation Period, Seller and Buyer have been
unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement related to the Closing Date
Balance Sheet, the Closing Date Recapture Settlement Statement or the VIF
Data, then, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.04(k), Seller and Buyer
will submit all such matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Notice
of Disagreement (along with a copy of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
Closing Date Recapture Settlement Statement marked to indicate those line
items and/or other information that are in dispute) to Ernst and Young LLP (as
determined pursuant to this Section 2.04(i), the "Independent Accountant"). In
the event that Ernst and Young LLP refuses or is otherwise unable to act as the
Independent Accountant, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to appoint
an independent and internationally recognized certified public accounting firm
mutually agreeable to the parties, in which event "Independent Accountant"
shall mean such firm. Within thirty (30) days after the submission of such
matters to the Independent Accountant, or as soon as practicable thereafter,
the Independent Accountant will make a final determination, binding on the
parties to this Agreement, of the appropriate amount of each of the line items
and other information in the Closing Date Balance Sheet or the Closing Date
Recapture Settlement Statement, as applicable, and the determination of any
dispute relating to the VIF Data, in each case, as to which Seller and Buyer
disagree as set out in the Notice of Disagreement. With respect to each
disputed line item in the Closing Date Balance Sheet or the Closing Date
Recapture Settlement Statement, such determination, if not in accordance with
the position of either Seller or Buyer, shall not be more favorable to Seller
than the amounts advocated by Seller in the Notice of Disagreement or more
favorable to Buyer than the amounts advocated by Buyer in the Closing Date
Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Recapture Settlement Statement, as
applicable, with respect to such disputed line item. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Independent Accountant's review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet
and the Closing Date Recapture Settlement Statement shall be limited to a
determination of whether such document was prepared in accordance with the
Agreed Accounting Principles or Recapture Settlement Statement Methodologies,
respectively, and the Independent Accountant shall not review any line items
or make any determination with respect to any matters not subject to a dispute
in the Notice of Disagreement. The pro forma balance sheet of HLIKK (prepared
in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles) and the determination of
the Closing Date Net Worth and the recapture settlement statement (prepared in
accordance with the Recapture Settlement Statement Methodologies) and the
determination of the Closing Date Net Monthly Settlement Balances and the
Closing Date HLIC Recapture Payment, as determined either through (i) failure
to timely deliver a Notice of Disagreement pursuant to Section 2.04(g), (ii)
agreement of the parties pursuant to Section 2.04(a) or 2.04(h) or (iii)
through the action of the Independent Accountant pursuant to this Section
2.04(i), are, in each case of clauses (i) - (iii), final and binding on the
parties and are referred to as the "Final Balance Sheet", the "Final Net
Worth", the "Final Recapture Settlement Statement", the "Final Net Monthly
Settlement Balances" and the "Final HLIC Recapture Payment", respectively.

(j) The cost of the Independent Accountant's review and determination will be
shared equally by Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand.
During the review by the Independent Accountant, Buyer and Seller will each
make available to the Independent Accountant

 interviews with such individuals, and such information, books and records and
work papers, as may be reasonably required by the Independent Accountant to
fulfill its obligations in Section 2.04(i); provided, however, that the
independent accountants of Seller or Buyer will not be obligated to make any
work papers available to the Independent Accountant unless and until such firm
has signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants.

(k) If, at the end of the Consultation Period, or such later time as the
Independent Accountant has made a determination with respect to any dispute
regarding any VIF Data pursuant to Section 2.04(i), Seller and Buyer have been
unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
determination of the Closing Date VIF Amount, then, other than with respect to
a dispute regarding the VIF Data, Seller and Buyer shall (i) jointly engage
Oliver Wyman (as determined pursuant to this Section 2.04(k), the "Independent
Actuary") to calculate the Closing Date VIF Amount, (ii) cause the Model
Escrow Agent to deliver the copy of the Agreed Model deposited with the Model
Escrow Agent to the Independent Actuary and (iii) instruct the Independent
Actuary to use such Agreed Model in its calculation of the Final VIF Amount
pursuant to this Section 2.04(k). In the event that Oliver Wyman refuses or is
otherwise unable to act as the Independent Actuary, the parties shall
cooperate in good faith to appoint an independent and internationally
recognized independent actuary or investment banking firm mutually agreeable
to the parties, in which event "Independent Actuary" shall mean such firm.
Buyer (and Milliman on behalf of Buyer) and Seller shall each have the
opportunity to consult with the Independent Actuary regarding its calculation
of the Closing Date VIF Amount; provided, however, neither party shall
communicate with the Independent Actuary with respect to such matters unless
it consults with the other party in advance and gives the other party the
opportunity to participate in such communication. Within thirty (30) days
after the submission of such matters to the Independent Actuary, or as soon as
practicable thereafter, the Independent Actuary will deliver to Buyer and
Seller a report (the "Final VIF Report") setting forth the Independent
Actuary's final calculation of the Closing Date VIF Amount in accordance with
the VIF Calculation Principles, and, if applicable, using the VIF Data as
finally determined by the Independent Accountant pursuant to Section 2.04(i)
(the "Final VIF Amount"), which amount shall not be more favorable to Seller
than the amount advocated by Seller in the Notice of Disagreement or more
favorable to Buyer than the amount advocated by Buyer in the Closing Date VIF
Report. The Final VIF Report and the Final VIF Amount shall be final and
binding on the parties. The cost of the Independent Actuary's review and
determination will be shared equally by Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on
the other hand.

(l) The "Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment" will be an adjustment to the
Purchase Price equal to the sum of (i) the Final Net Worth minus the Estimated
Closing Date Net Worth (the "Net Worth Adjustment") and (ii) the Final VIF
Amount minus Milliman's calculation of the VIF as set forth on Buyer's Interim
VIF Report for the month preceding the month in which the Closing Date occurs
(the "VIF Adjustment"). If the Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment is a
positive amount, then (i) if the Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment is
greater than the amount of funds in the VIF Escrow Account, (x) the parties
shall instruct the VIF Escrow Agent to disburse all of the funds held in the
VIF Escrow Account, if any, to Seller in the manner and within the time period
required by Section 2.05(a) and (y) Buyer will pay in cash to Seller the
remaining portion of the Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment in accordance
with Section 2.05(a) and (ii)

 if the amount of funds in the VIF Escrow Account is greater than the Post-
Closing Purchase Price Adjustment, then (x) the parties shall instruct the VIF
Escrow Agent to disburse funds in an amount equal to the Post-Closing Purchase
Price Adjustment to Seller in the manner and within the time period required
by Section 2.05(a) and (y) the parties shall instruct the VIF Escrow Agent to
disburse the remaining portion of the funds in the VIF Escrow Account to
Buyer. If the Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment is a negative amount,
then Seller will pay in cash to Buyer an amount equal to the absolute value of
the Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment and (ii) the parties shall instruct
the VIF Escrow Agent to disburse all of the funds held in the VIF Escrow
Account to Buyer. Any such payment will be made within two (2) Business Days
after the Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment is determined, together with
interest thereon at the Interest Rate calculated and payable in accordance
with Section 2.05.

(m) The "Post-Closing Recapture Payment Adjustment" will be an adjustment to
the Recapture Payment with respect to the HLIC Recapture Agreement equal to
the Final HLIC Recapture Payment minus the aggregate Fair Market Value, as of
the Effective Time, of the Eligible Recapture Assets, including the amount of
cash included therein, transferred to HLIKK in connection with the settlement
pursuant to the HLIC Recapture Agreement, as finally determined in accordance
with Section 2.04(i). If the Post-Closing Recapture Payment Adjustment is
positive, then Seller shall cause HLIC to pay in cash to HLIKK an amount equal
to the Post-Closing Recapture Payment Adjustment. If the Post-Closing
Recapture Payment Adjustment is negative, then Buyer shall cause HLIKK to pay
in cash to HLIC an amount equal to the absolute value of the Post-Closing
Recapture Payment Adjustment. Any such payment will be paid within two (2)
Business Days after the Final HLIC Recapture Payment and the aggregate Fair
Market Value, as of the Effective Time, of the Eligible Recapture Assets
transferred to HLIKK in connection with the settlement pursuant to the HLIC
Recapture Agreement are determined, together with interest thereon at the
Interest Rate calculated and payable in accordance with Section 2.05.

(n) The "Post-Closing Net Monthly Settlement Balance Adjustment" with respect
to each of the Recapture Agreements and the 3-Wins Reinsurance Agreement
Amendment will be an amount equal to the applicable Final Net Monthly
Settlement Balance minus the applicable Estimated Closing Date Net Monthly
Settlement Balance. If any such Post-Closing Net Monthly Settlement Balance
Adjustment is positive, then Buyer shall cause HLIKK to pay in cash to the
applicable Hartford Reinsurer an amount equal to such Post-Closing Net Monthly
Settlement Balance Adjustment. If any such Post-Closing Net Monthly Settlement
Balance Adjustment is negative, then Seller shall cause the applicable
Hartford Reinsurer to pay in cash to HLIKK an amount equal to the absolute
value of such Post-Closing Net Monthly Settlement Balance Adjustment. Any such
payments will be paid within two (2) Business Days after the applicable Final
Net Monthly Settlement Balance is determined, together with interest thereon
at the Interest Rate calculated and payable in accordance with Section 2.05.

(o) The final determinations of the Independent Accountant pursuant to Section
2.04(i) and the Independent Actuary pursuant to Section 2.04(k) shall be
expert determinations under New York Law governing expert determination and
appraisal proceedings. Any claim, dispute or controversy arising out of or
relating to the final determinations of the Independent Accountant pursuant to
Section 2.04(i) and the Independent Actuary pursuant to Section 2.04(k),
including

 enforcement of such final determinations, shall be resolved by arbitration in
accordance with Section 14.11.

Section 2.05 Payments and Computations.

(a) Each party will make each payment due to the other party to this Agreement
pursuant to this Article II as early as practicable on the day when due. All
payments will be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts designated by the party receiving such payment no later
than five (5) Business Days preceding the date of payment. All computations of
interest will be at the Interest Rate on the basis of a year of 360 days, in
each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding
the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable.
Whenever any payment under this Agreement will be due on a day other than a
Business Day, such payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day,
and such extension of time will be included in the computation of payment of
interest.

(b) Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, for purposes of this
Agreement, including this Article II, the currency of payments to be made in
this Agreement and the methodologies for the conversion of currencies shall be
as set forth in Schedule 2.05.

the case of each of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), excluding
the effects of any conditions, restrictions or requirements that are not
material in their impact on the cash flow and expected returns of the
Business; provided, that the items described on Schedule 7.03(a) are
conditions, restrictions and requirements that may be imposed by the FSA that
will not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Burdensome Condition;
provided, further, however, variance from the description on Schedule 7.03(a)
may be considered together with any other conditions, restrictions or
requirements imposed by a Governmental Authority in determining whether all
such conditions in the aggregate constitute a Burdensome Condition.

(b) Seller and Buyer shall promptly notify one another of any communication it
receives from any Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the
subject of this Agreement and permit the other party to review in advance any
proposed communication by such party to any Governmental Authority and shall
provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or
communications between such party or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other
hand, in each case, other than immaterial communications and correspondence
that would not reasonably be expected to affect the regulatory approval
process and do not relate to a Burdensome Condition. Neither Seller nor Buyer
shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults
with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting, other than meetings in respect of immaterial
communications and correspondence that would not reasonably be expected to
affect the regulatory approval process and do not relate to a Burdensome
Condition, in each case, except as otherwise required or requested by the
applicable Governmental Authority. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement
and to Section 7.02, Seller and Buyer will coordinate and cooperate fully with
each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the
other party may reasonably request in connection

 with the foregoing; provided, however, that neither party shall be required to
disclose to the other any of its or its Affiliates' confidential competitive
information. Neither party shall be required to comply with any provision of
this Section 7.03(b) to the extent that such compliance would be prohibited by
applicable Law.

(c) Each of Seller and Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall cooperate
and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as possible and
prior to the Closing Date, (i) any consents and approvals from the contract
counterparties set forth on Schedule 7.03(c)(i), (ii) at the request of Buyer,
any consents and approvals from the contract counterparties set forth on
Schedule 7.03(c)(ii), or (iii) at the request of Buyer, an agreement to enter
into new agreements, the terms and conditions of which Buyer reasonably
agrees, from the contract counterparties set forth on Schedule 7.03(c)(iii),
and make any other notifications that may be or may become reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to be made or obtained (as applicable) by
Seller, Buyer or their respective Affiliates, in connection with the transfer
of the Shares or otherwise, to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements; provided,
however, that neither party shall be required to compensate any third party
(except as set forth in the following sentence), commence or participate in
litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any
third party to obtain any such consent or approval. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall each bear fifty percent (50%) of the cost to
compensate any third party to obtain any consent or approval under this
Section 7.03(c), except for the consent or approval of the contract
counterparties for contracts set forth on Schedule 7.03(c)(ii) entering into
new agreements with the contract counterparties set forth on Schedule
7.03(c)(iii), in each case, to the extent requested by Buyer.

(d) In the event and to the extent that Seller and Buyer are unable to obtain
any consent or approval from the contract counterparties set forth in Schedule
7.03(d), after complying with Section 7.03(c), then Seller shall continue to
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such consent or approval following
the Closing Date (unless Buyer advises Seller to cease such efforts) and (i)
Seller shall, for a period of up to six (6) months following the Closing, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts in cooperation with
Buyer and its Affiliates (including HLIKK) to (A) provide or cause to be
provided to HLIKK the benefits of the applicable agreement and (B) enforce for
the account of Buyer and its Affiliates any rights of Seller and its
Affiliates arising from such agreement and (ii) Buyer shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, assume the liabilities and perform the obligations of
Seller and its Affiliates arising under such agreement.

the Transaction Agreements and (ii) for the intercompany obligations set forth
in Schedule 7.04, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take such
action, including making such payments as may be necessary, so that, prior to
or concurrently with the Closing, HLIKK, on the one hand, and Seller and its
Affiliates (other than HLIKK), on the other hand, shall settle, discharge,
offset, pay or repay in full all intercompany loans, notes, and advances
regardless of their maturity and all intercompany receivables and payables for
the amount due, including any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the
date of payment.

concurrently with the Closing all Intercompany Agreements, after giving effect
to Section 7.04.

Estimated Closing Date Net Worth, Closing Date Net Worth and Final Net Worth
or shall otherwise be borne by Seller.

assign its rights and obligations under the Berkshire Retrocession Agreement
to Buyer Reinsurer promptly following receipt of notice from Buyer or its
Representative of formation of Buyer Reinsurer pursuant to Section 7.08.
Unless the other party otherwise consents in advance in writing, prior to the
consummation of the Closing neither party shall, and each party shall cause
its respective Affiliates not to, (a) except as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, modify, amend, assign or terminate, or waive any rights
under, the Berkshire Retrocession Agreement, (b) take any actions or suffer to
exist any event, condition or omission that would result in any breach of, or
constitute a default under, or give to Berkshire any right to terminate or
assign, the Berkshire Retrocession Agreement or (c) take any actions or suffer
to exist any event, condition or omission that would result in the reinsurance
provided by Berkshire pursuant to the Berkshire Retrocession Agreement not
becoming effective automatically upon the Closing.

Section 7.08 Formation of Buyer Reinsurer. Buyer Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to organize Buyer Reinsurer as a Cayman Islands Class
B(iii) insurance company and to obtain all necessary Governmental Approvals to
allow Buyer Reinsurer to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under

following the date hereof and shall promptly inform, or cause a Representative
to inform, Seller of the formation of Buyer Reinsurer. Buyer Parent shall
capitalize Buyer Reinsurer to the extent necessary to obtain any such
Governmental Approvals.

Section 7.09 Disclosure Schedule Updates. Approximately five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with an updated Seller
Disclosure Schedule, if any, and Buyer shall provide Seller with an updated
Buyer Disclosure Schedule, if any, disclosing (i) any matter hereafter arising
and (ii) any matter hereafter discovered which, in the case of a matter being
disclosed pursuant to clause (i) hereof if existing at the date hereof or, in
the case of a matter being disclosed pursuant to clause (ii) hereof, if known
at the date hereof, would have been required to be set forth or described in
the Disclosure Schedule provided by them; provided, however, that any such
updated disclosure by Seller or Buyer shall not be deemed to have been
disclosed as of

 the date hereof, to constitute part of, or an amendment or supplement to, the
Disclosure Schedule provided by Seller or Buyer, to cure any breach or
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty or to have any effect for the
purpose of determining the satisfaction of the conditions to the obligations
of Seller or Buyer under Article XI or Seller's or Buyer's indemnification
obligations under Article XIII.

Section 7.10 Seller Guarantees. Seller shall notify Buyer of any request,
demand or claim by or on behalf of HLIKK or its contractholders or other
creditors to any guarantor under the Seller Guarantees to make funds available

Section 7.12 Transition Services Agreement. Between the date hereof and the
Closing, Seller and Buyer shall and shall cause their Affiliates and
Representatives to do the following:

(a) use reasonable best efforts to identify:

(i) Services (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) other than
Excluded Services (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) or
services already listed on Schedule 2.1(a) to the form of Transition Services
Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit G, that were previously performed by HFIC
or one of its Affiliates (other than HLIKK) to or for the Business during the
twelve (12) months prior to the estimated Closing Date (the "Omitted
Services");

(ii) Scheduled Services (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) that
were listed on Schedules 2.1(a)(i) or (ii) to the Transition Services
Agreement but are mutually determined by the parties hereto, after good-faith
negotiations, to not be necessary for the benefit of Berkshire because HLIKK
will be fully capable of performing those Scheduled Services (for itself,
Buyer Reinsurer and Buyer Reinsurer's retrocessionaire) on its own through its
separate capabilities as in existence from immediately prior to execution of
this Agreement to immediately following the Closing Date ("Unnecessary
Scheduled Services"); provided, however, if the Scheduled Services referred to
in this sub-paragraph were (x) not previously performed by HFIC or one of its
Affiliates (other than HLIKK) to or for the Business during the twelve (12)
months prior to the estimated Closing Date and (y) cannot be performed by HFIC
or one of its Affiliates with their available resources, then such Scheduled
Services shall be governed by the following sub-paragraph; and

(iii) Scheduled Services (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) not
for the benefit of Berkshire that were listed on Schedules 2.1(a)(i) or (ii)
to the Transition Services Agreement but are determined, after good-faith
negotiations between the Parties, to constitute either Excluded Services or
were not previously performed by HFIC or one of

 its Affiliates (other than HLIKK) to or for the Business during the twelve
(12) months prior to the estimated Closing Date (the "Inadvertently Included
Services"); and

(b) in connection therewith, to make such amendments and modifications to the
schedules to the Transition Services Agreement as may be requested by Buyer to
include such Omitted Services as Scheduled Services (as defined in the
Transition Services Agreement) or remove such Unnecessary Scheduled Services
and Inadvertently Included Services from the Scheduled Services.

Section 7.13 Model Escrow Agreement. Seller and Buyer shall, and shall each
use their reasonable best efforts to cause Iron Mountain Intellectual Property
Management, Inc. (the "Model Escrow Agent") to, within five (5) Business Days
after the date hereof, enter into an escrow agreement in substantially the
form attached hereto as Exhibit L with such changes requested by the Model
Escrow Agent as are reasonably acceptable to the parties (the "Model Escrow
Agreement"), pursuant to which Seller will deliver a copy of the Agreed Model
to the Model Escrow Agent to hold in escrow in accordance with the terms and
conditions thereof.

Section 7.14 Agreed Model Scenarios. Seller shall deliver to Berkshire within
five (5) Business Days after the date hereof scenario results generated by the

ARTICLE VIII 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 8.01 Access to Information. After the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall
cause its respective Affiliates (including HLIKK) to, preserve, until such
date as may be required by Buyer's, or its applicable Affiliates', standard
document retention policies (but for not less than six years from the Closing
Date or such later date as may be required by applicable Law), all pre-Closing
Date records related to HLIKK possessed or to be possessed by such Person.
During such period, upon any reasonable request from Seller or its
Representatives, Buyer or any of its Affiliates holding such records shall (a)
provide to Seller or its Representatives reasonable access to such records
during normal business hours; provided, that such access shall not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Buyer or its
Affiliates holding such records, and (b) permit Seller to make copies of such
records, in each case, at no cost to Buyer or its Representatives (other than
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses). Nothing herein shall require Buyer or
its Affiliates to disclose any information to Seller if such disclosure would
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, the work product immunity or any
other legal privilege or similar doctrine or contravene any applicable Law,
Governmental Order or any fiduciary duty or agreement (including any
confidentiality agreement to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party)
(it being understood that Buyer and its Affiliates shall cooperate in any
reasonable best efforts and requests for waivers that would enable otherwise
required disclosure to Buyer or its Representatives to occur without so
jeopardizing privilege or contravening such Applicable Law, Governmental Order
or fiduciary duty or agreement) or (except as provided in Section 10.04)
require Buyer or its Affiliates to disclose

 its Tax records (except for Tax records of, or with respect to, HLIKK) or any
personnel or related records. Such records may be requested under this Section
8.01 for any reasonable purpose, including to the extent reasonably required
in connection with accounting, litigation, financial reporting, federal
securities disclosure or other similar purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
upon the expiration of such retention period, any and all such records may be
destroyed by Buyer in its sole discretion.

Section 8.02 Books and Records. Subject to Section 8.03(b) and except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, Seller and its Affiliates shall have the
right to retain copies of all books and records of HLIKK and the Business
relating to periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Buyer agrees that,
with respect to all original books and records of HLIKK existing as of the
Closing Date, it will (and will cause HLIKK to) (a) comply in all material
respects with all applicable Laws relating to the preservation and retention
of records and (b) apply commercially reasonable preservation and retention
policies that are no less stringent than those generally applied by Buyer.

Section 8.03 Confidentiality.

(a) The terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated April 25, 2013 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), between Seller and Buyer are incorporated into
this Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force and effect until
the Closing, at which time the confidentiality obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. If, for any reason, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates, shall, and shall
cause their respective Representatives to, hold confidential all information
relating to HLIKK obtained prior to the Closing Date or obtained from Buyer or
its Affiliates pursuant to Section 8.01 and not to use any confidential
information concerning HLIKK for any reason whatsoever, including for
competitive purposes or to obtain any commercial advantage with respect to
HLIKK or attempt to divert any business or customer of HLIKK.

(c) From and after the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates (including HLIKK),
shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to, maintain in
confidence, and not use to the detriment of Seller (including for the purposes
of competing with Seller or its Affiliates), any written, oral or other
information relating to or obtained from Seller or its Affiliates prior to the
Closing Date, other than information to the extent relating to HLIKK.

(d) The requirements of Sections 8.03(b) and 8.03(c) shall not apply to the
extent that (i) any such information is or becomes generally available to the
public other than (A) in the case of Buyer, as a result of disclosure by
Seller, its Affiliates or any of its Representatives and (B) in the case of
Seller, as a result of disclosure by Buyer, HLIKK (after the Closing Date) or
any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, (ii) any such
information is required by applicable Law, Governmental Order or a
Governmental Authority to be disclosed after prior notice has been given to
the other party or (iii) any such information was or becomes available to such
party on a non-confidential basis and from a source (other than a party to
this Agreement or any Affiliate or

 Representative of such party) that is not bound by a confidentiality agreement
with respect to such information. Each of the parties hereto shall instruct
its Affiliates and Representatives having access to such information of such
obligation of confidentiality.

Section 8.04 Non-Compete; Non-Solicit.

(a) During the Restricted Period and within the Restricted Territory, neither
Seller nor any of its Controlled Affiliates shall engage (for their own
account or for the benefit of any other Person), directly or indirectly, as a
principal or solely or jointly with others, or as stockholders, partners,
members or other owners in or of any Person, in any business that competes
directly or indirectly, with the Business as currently conducted (a "Competing
Business") (including, without limitation, marketing, servicing and
underwriting activities and providing substantial assumption reinsurance
relating to lines of business comprising part of the Business or related
thereto).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 8.04(a), and
without implication that the following activities otherwise would be subject
to the provisions of this Section 8.04, nothing in this Agreement shall
preclude, prohibit or restrict Seller or its Affiliates from engaging, or
require Seller to cause any Affiliate not to engage, in any manner in any of
the following:

(i) making investments in the ordinary course of business, including in a
general or separate account of an insurance company or in an investment fund
or other investment vehicle, in Persons engaging in a Competing Business;
provided that each such investment is a passive investment where neither
Seller nor any of its Controlled Affiliates: (A) intends to or has the right
to influence or direct the operation or management of any such Person; or (B)
is a participant with any other Person in any group with such intention or
right;

(ii) acquiring not more than ten percent (10%) of the total issued and
outstanding equity interests of any Person engaging in a Competing Business as
a result of the exercise of contractual remedies by Seller or any of its
current or future Affiliates as the holder of a debt instrument;

(iii) making investments in Buyer and its Affiliates;

that derived less than twenty-five percent (25%) of its net operating revenue
on a consolidated basis for its most recent fiscal year from a Competing
Business;

(v) acquiring (whether by way of merger or stock or asset acquisition or
otherwise), directly or indirectly, any Person or business (an "Acquired
Business") where such Acquired Business derived twenty-five percent (25%) or
more of its net operating revenue on a consolidated basis for its most recent
fiscal year from a Competing Business; provided, that Seller shall either (x)
use its reasonable best efforts to, or shall cause its relevant Controlled
Affiliate to their reasonable best efforts to, sell, spin off or otherwise
divest itself (or enter into an agreement to sell, spin off or otherwise
divest itself) of the portion of the division, unit or Person related to

 such Acquired Business that engages in the business that competes directly or
indirectly with the Business within twelve (12) months of the closing of the
acquisition of such Acquired Business; or (y) modify, or cause its relevant
Controlled Affiliate to modify, such Acquired Business such that such Acquired
Business derives less than twenty-five percent (25%) of its net operating
revenue on a consolidated basis from a Competing Business;

(vi) selling any of its assets or businesses to a Person that is itself, or
has Affiliates that are, engaged in a Competing Business;

(vii) managing, controlling, advising or providing administrative or similar
services to investment funds or other investment vehicles that make passive
investments in Persons engaging in a Competing Business, so long as such
investments are in the ordinary course of business; or

(viii) providing reinsurance to any Person engaging in a Competing Business,
so long as Seller and its Controlled Affiliates are not engaged in the
underwriting or marketing of such reinsured business.

(c) During the Restricted Period, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
shall solicit or hire any Employee without the prior written consent of Buyer;
provided, however, that this Section 8.04(c) shall not prohibit the hiring of
any Employee whose employment has been terminated by Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer, as applicable, where neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has
solicited such Employee for employment prior to the date of the termination of
such Employee by Buyer or its Affiliate, as applicable; and provided, further,
that nothing in this Section 8.04(c) shall prohibit Seller or any of its
Affiliates from employing or hiring any Person who contacts Seller or any of
its Affiliates on his or her own initiative without direct solicitation or as
a result of a general solicitation to the public or general advertising.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Section
8.04: (i) shall cease to apply to any Person from and after such time as such
Person ceases to be an Affiliate of Seller; (ii) shall not apply to any Person
that purchases or receives assets, operations or a business from Seller or one
of its Affiliates, so long as such Person is not an Affiliate of Seller after
such transaction is consummated; and (iii) shall cease to apply if a
controlling interest in Seller or all or substantially all of its assets are
sold to, or Seller merges with or into, a Person that was not, immediately
prior thereto, an Affiliate of Seller; provided, that in the case of clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii) above, none of Seller, its then current or former
Affiliates or any such acquiring Person nor any of its Affiliates shall carry
on a business that competes directly or indirectly with the Business in the
Restricted Territory using the name "Hartford" during the Restricted Period.

(e) The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the covenants set forth in
this Section 8.04 are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but for
these covenants, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement. The
parties to this Agreement acknowledge that this Section 8.04 constitutes an
independent covenant and shall not be affected by performance or
nonperformance of any other provision of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreements by the parties.

 Section 8.05 Exclusivity.

(a) Buyer is aware that, prior to the date of this Agreement, Seller has had
discussions with one or more third parties concerning a possible transaction
or transactions which may or may not be similar to the transaction proposed by
Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller agrees that it shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, and will cause their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives not to,
at any time during the period from the date hereof to the earlier of the
Closing Date and the date on which this Agreement is terminated (the
"Exclusivity Period"), directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
encourage submission of further proposals or offers from any Person, other
than Buyer, relating to any acquisition or purchase of Shares, or any business
combination involving HLIKK, or any acquisition of all or substantially all of
the assets of HLIKK; or (ii) further participate in any negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any other person any additional non-public
information with respect to, or otherwise further cooperate in any way with,
or assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by

(b) During the Exclusivity Period, Seller shall not, without the consent of
Buyer, enter into, or commit to enter into, any transactions of the type
described in Section 8.05(a). In addition, Seller agrees that it will
immediately cease, from the date hereof through the end of the Exclusivity
Period, any existing discussions or negotiations with any party other than
Buyer or its Affiliates that relate to, or may reasonably be expected to lead
to, any transaction of the type described in Section 8.05(a).

Section 8.06 Insurance.

(a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, except as expressly provided in
Section 8.06(b), effective at the time of the Closing, HLIKK will cease to be
insured by any insurance policies of Seller and its Affiliates (other than

(b) Seller shall cause the interest and rights of Seller and its Affiliates as
of the Effective Time as insureds or beneficiaries under occurrence based
insurance policies (and under third party claims made based insurance policies
to the extent a third party claim has been submitted prior to the Closing) of
Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with HLIKK in respect of periods
prior to the Effective Time to survive the Closing for the period for which
such interests and rights would have survived without regard to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent permitted under such
policies, and Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, continue to
administer third party claims made under occurrence based policies with
respect to Losses occurring prior to the Effective Time (and third party
claims made prior to the Effective Time under third party claims made based
policies) on behalf of HLIKK, subject to reimbursement by Buyer for the actual
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of such ongoing administration (including
internal costs and expenses related to employees of Seller or any of its
Affiliates for time spent in connection therewith). Any proceeds received by
Seller or any of its Affiliates after the Closing under occurrence based
policies for third party claims with respect to Losses occurring prior to the
Effective Time (and under third party claims made based policies with respect
to third party claims made prior to the Effective Time) in respect of HLIKK
shall be for the benefit of Buyer unless such proceeds relate to expenditures

 that have been made prior to the Effective Time or any business interruption
prior to the Effective Time.

Section 8.07 Trade Names and Trademarks. Except as provided in the Transaction
Agreements:

(a) Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that Buyer
is not purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining any right, title or
interest in and to any Intellectual Property owned by Seller or its Affiliates
(other than HLIKK), including the name "Hartford", or any Trademark or

variation of the foregoing or any confusingly similar Trademark or Internet
domain name, (including all registrations and applications relating thereto)
(collectively, the "Seller Names and Marks"), and, except as otherwise
expressly provided in the Trademark License Agreement, neither Buyer nor any
of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, HLIKK) shall have any rights
in the Seller Names and Marks and neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, HLIKK) shall contest the ownership or validity
of any rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates in or to the Seller Names and
Marks. Buyer hereby consents to Seller causing HLIKK to transfer all Seller
Names and Marks to Seller or one of its Affiliates prior to the Closing, and
such transfer(s) shall not constitute a breach of any term or condition of
this Agreement.

(b) Buyer agrees that except as otherwise provided in the Trademark License
Agreement, following the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates (including
HLIKK) shall cease and discontinue all uses of the Seller Names and Marks,
either alone or in combination with other words and all Trademark or Internet
domain name similar to any of the foregoing or embodying any of the foregoing
alone or in combination with other words. Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, HLIKK), agrees that the rights of HLIKK to
the Seller Names and Marks pursuant to the terms of any existing trademark
agreements shall terminate on the Closing Date.

(c) Prior to the termination or expiration of the Trademark License Agreement,
or such additional period as mutually agreed by the parties in writing, Buyer
and its Affiliates (including HLIKK) shall re-label, destroy or exhaust all
materials bearing the Seller Names and Marks, including signage, advertising,
promotional materials, software, packaging, inventory, electronic materials,
collateral goods, stationery, business cards, web sites, and other materials,
and make all filings with any office, agency or body to effect the elimination
of any use of the Seller Names and Marks from the business of HLIKK, so as to
bring Buyer and its Affiliates into compliance with this Section 8.07 and the
Trademark License Agreement. Buyer shall take all necessary action to ensure
that other users of the Seller Names and Marks, whose rights terminate as set
forth in this Section 8.07, shall cease use of the Seller Names and Marks
except as expressly authorized by the Trademark License Agreement. Buyer's
rights and obligations with respect to its limited transitional use of the
Seller Name and Marks after Closing shall be as set forth in the Trademark
License Agreement. Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that after the
Closing Date Buyer and its Affiliates (including HLIKK) will not expressly, or
by implication, do business as or represent themselves as Seller or its
Affiliates.

 (d) Buyer shall execute any necessary documentation in order to amend the
organizational documents with respect to HLIKK such that HLIKK can effect a
change in its name to a name not containing any of the Seller Name and Marks
in accordance with the timeframes set forth in the Trademark License
Agreement. Buyer shall cause HLIKK to file the application documents to
register a new trade name with the applicable Governmental Authority and take
all other necessary action to fulfill its obligations set forth in this
Section 8.07 in accordance with the timeframes set forth in the Trademark
License Agreement.

Section 8.08 Guarantees. Nothing in the Assignment, Assumption, Hold Harmless
and Indemnification Agreement shall prevent Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including HLIKK) from claiming a right to indemnification or pursuing other
remedies against Seller and its Affiliates in accordance with and subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

and Indemnification Agreement, Trademark License Agreement, Transition
Services Agreement, Trademark Assignment and Buyer Reinsurance Agreement and
shall, at or prior to the Closing, execute and deliver or cause to be executed
and delivered each such agreement.

Section 8.10 DandO Liabilities. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
not, and shall cause HLIKK not to, take any steps that would reasonably be
expected to affect adversely the rights of any individual who served as a
director, statutory auditor or officer of HLIKK at any time prior to the
Closing Date (each, a "DandO Indemnified Person") to be indemnified against or
to be released from, under applicable Law, its organizational documents or
agreements, if any, or shareholder resolutions, against any liabilities,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date
and relating to the fact that such DandO Indemnified Person was a director,
statutory auditor or officer of HLIKK, whether asserted or claimed prior to,
at or after the Closing Date.

Section 8.11 VIF Reports. Buyer shall prepare (or shall cause Milliman to
prepare on its behalf) and deliver to Seller by the eighth (8th) Business Day
prior to the first (1st) Business Day of each calendar month between the date
hereof and the Closing Date, and Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer by
the seventh (7th) Business Day prior to the first (1st) Business Day of each
calendar month between the date hereof and the Closing Date a report (each, an
"Interim VIF Report") setting forth such party's (or, in the case of Buyer,
Milliman's) calculation of the VIF as of the thirteenth (13th) Business Day
prior to the first (1st) Business Day of such month, which report shall be
prepared in accordance with the VIF Calculation Principles. Buyer and Seller
shall, and Buyer shall cause Milliman to, each cooperate with each other in
the preparation of the Interim VIF Reports, including providing all relevant

shall, and Buyer shall cause Milliman to, use their reasonable best efforts to
resolve any differences and to correct any errors or mistakes in the
preparation of, and any inaccuracies reflected in, their respective Interim
VIF Reports. With respect to each party's Interim

 VIF Report for the month preceding the month in which the Closing Date would
otherwise occur, if Milliman's and Seller's calculations of the VIF in such
Interim VIF Reports differ by more than $50,000,000 and Buyer and Seller are
unable to resolve any such differences prior to the third (3rd) Business Day
prior to the Closing Date, then, subject to Article XII, either party may
elect to delay the Closing until the earliest first (1st) Business Day of a
month when Milliman's calculation of the VIF and Seller's calculation of the
VIF in each party's following Interim VIF Reports differ by $50,000,000 or
less.

Section 8.12 Further Action.

(a) Seller and Buyer (i) shall execute and deliver, or shall cause to be
executed and delivered, such documents and other papers and shall take, or
shall cause to be taken, such further actions as may be reasonably required to
carry out the provisions of the Transaction Agreements and give effect to the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, (ii) shall refrain
from taking any actions that could reasonably be expected to impair, delay or
impede the Closing, (iii) without limiting the foregoing, shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause all the conditions to the
obligations of the other party to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be met as soon as reasonably practicable and (iv) shall
cooperate in good faith to facilitate an orderly Closing and transition.

(b) Each of Seller and Buyer shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the
status of the matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including with respect to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Article XI. From time to time following the Closing,
Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
execute, acknowledge and deliver all reasonable further conveyances, notices,
assumptions, releases and acquittances and such instruments, and shall take
such reasonable actions as may be necessary or appropriate to make effective
the transactions contemplated hereby as may be reasonably requested by the
other party.

ARTICLE IX 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

Section 9.01 Employee Matters.

(a) Terms and Conditions of Employment. Buyer shall comply with all applicable
Laws relating to the terms and conditions of each Employee's employment on and
after the Closing Date, including but not limited to any work rules (shugyo
kisoku), and any changes made thereto shall be made in compliance with
applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, beginning with the
Closing Date and for a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall provide, or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates
(including HLIKK) to provide (i) each Employee, while such Employee is in the
employ or service of HLIKK or another Affiliate of Buyer, with (1) cash
compensation (including wages, base salary, and annual bonus or incentive
opportunities) at levels, respectively, no less favorable than the levels,
respectively, of cash compensation paid by HLIKK to such Employees immediately
prior to the Closing and (2) employee benefits (excluding severance) that are,
in the aggregate, no less favorable than the

 aggregate employee benefits (excluding severance) provided by HLIKK to such
Employees immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) each Employee whose
employment is terminated during such period (for the avoidance of doubt, such
period will end on the date following the date that is twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date) with severance pay and benefits on terms and
conditions (including eligibility conditions) and in amounts that are no less
favorable than those applicable to such Employee immediately prior to the
Closing.

(b) Prior Service. To the extent that service is relevant for purposes of
eligibility and vesting (and, in order to calculate the amount of any
vacation, sick days, severance and/or layoff or benefits under any employee
benefit plan, program, policy, agreement, arrangement for the benefit of the
Employees), Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, credit each
Employee for any and all service earned by such Employee on and prior to the
Closing with HLIKK, its Affiliates or any of its predecessors (but only to the
extent such service with a predecessor was credited by HLIKK or its Affiliates
or is required to be credited under applicable Law) under such plan, program,
policy, agreement, arrangement or practice.

(c) No Other Restrictions. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law or
specifically by the terms of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall
prevent Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including HLIKK) from (i) terminating
the employment of any of the Employees, or otherwise shall guarantee any of
the Employees continued employment or retention to provide services with Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including HLIKK), or any of their successors or
assigns, for any period of time or (ii) adopting, continuing, modifying or
terminating any Benefit Plan. No Employee, nor any beneficiary or dependent
thereof, shall be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement or be entitled
to bring any action or claim hereunder.

TAX MATTERS

Section 10.01 Liability for Taxes.

(a) Seller shall be liable for and pay, and shall indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against, and reimburse any
Buyer Indemnified Party for, any Losses with respect to (i) Taxes imposed on
HLIKK as a result of HLIKK having been a member of Seller's Group under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of applicable
Law, (ii) any breach or failure of Seller to perform any of its covenants or
obligations contained in this Article X, (iii) Taxes imposed on HLIKK for any
Pre-Closing Taxable Periods and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on the day before the Closing Date and
(iv) Taxes imposed on HLIKK arising out of a breach of the representation made
in Section 5.20(e); provided, however, that Seller shall not be liable for or
pay, and shall not indemnify Buyer from and against, (A) any Taxes that result
from any actual or deemed election under Sections 336(e) or 338 of the Code or
any similar provisions of state, local or foreign law as a result of the
purchase of the Shares or the deemed purchase of the Capital Stock of any
transferred Subsidiary or that result from Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or
HLIKK engaging in any activity or transaction that would cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be treated as a purchase or
sale of assets of HLIKK for foreign, federal, state, local or other Tax
purposes

 and (B) any Taxes for which Buyer is liable under Section 10.01(b) (Taxes
described in this proviso, hereinafter "Excluded Taxes"). Except as otherwise
provided in Section 10.01(f), Seller shall be entitled to any refund of (or
credit for) Taxes allocable to any Pre-Closing Taxable Periods and, with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending on
the day before the Closing Date, in each case net of any out-of-pocket costs
reasonably incurred by Buyer in pursuing or obtaining such refund. Any such
refunds received by Buyer or its Affiliates shall be promptly, and in any
event within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such refund, paid over to
Seller. Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates to take reasonable steps to
secure any such refund or credit that would be available.

(b) Buyer shall be liable for and pay, and shall indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against, and reimburse any
Seller Indemnified Party for, any Losses with respect to (i) Taxes imposed on
HLIKK, or for which HLIKK may otherwise be liable, for any Post-Closing
Taxable Periods and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
Straddle Period beginning on and including the Closing Date, (ii) any breach
or failure of Buyer to perform any of its covenants or obligations contained
in this Article X, (iii) Taxes imposed or required to be paid by a Seller
Indemnified Party arising as a result of actions taken by HLIKK on or after
the Closing Date, (iv) Taxes imposed on HLIKK, or for which HLIKK may
otherwise be liable, arising out of the Closing Reinsurance Transactions, and
(v) Excluded Taxes. Except as otherwise provided herein, Buyer shall be
entitled to any refund of (or credit for) Taxes allocable to any Post-Closing
Taxable Periods and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
Straddle Period beginning on the Closing Date. Any such refunds received by
Seller or its Affiliates shall be promptly, and in any event within thirty
(30) days of the receipt of such refund, paid over to Buyer, net of any out-
of-pocket costs reasonably incurred by the Seller in pursuing or obtaining
such refund. Seller shall and shall cause its Affiliates to take reasonable
steps to secure any such refund or credit that would be available.

(c) For purposes of Sections 10.01(a) and 10.01(b), whenever it is necessary
to determine the liability for Taxes of HLIKK for a Straddle Period, the
determination of the Taxes of HLIKK for the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the day before the Closing Date, and the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning on and including the Closing Date shall be determined by
assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods,
one which ended at the close of the day before the Closing Date and the other
which began at the beginning of the Closing Date, and items of income, gain,
deduction, loss or credit of HLIKK for the Straddle Period shall be allocated
between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by
assuming that the books of HLIKK were closed at the close of the day before
the Closing Date; provided, however, that Tax obligations, exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as
annual property taxes and the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned
between such two taxable years or periods on a daily basis. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.01(c), for purposes of the
Japanese fixed property tax, the straddle period shall begin on January 1 of
the year in which the Closing Date occurs, and shall end on December 31 of
that year. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of Sections 10.01(a) and
10.01(b), whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of
HLIKK, the term "Closing Date" shall refer to the day as determined under
local Tokyo time.

 (d) If, as a result of any action, suit, investigation, audit, claim,
assessment or amended Tax Return, there is any change on or after the Closing
Date in an item of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit or amount of Tax that
results in an increase in a Tax liability for which Seller would otherwise be
liable pursuant to Section 10.01(a), and such change results in or will result
in a decrease in the Tax liability of HLIKK, Buyer or any Affiliate or
successor of any thereof for any taxable year or period beginning on or after
the Closing Date or for the portion of any Straddle Period beginning on and
including the Closing Date, Seller shall not be liable pursuant to Section
10.01(a) with respect to such increase to the extent of the present value
(using a discount rate equal to the then "Federal mid-term rate," as that term
is defined in Section 1274(d) of the Code) of such decrease (and, to the
extent such increase in Tax liability is paid to a Tax Authority by Seller or
any of its Affiliates, Buyer shall pay Seller an amount equal to the present
value of such decrease).

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any real property
transfer or real property gains Tax, transfer Tax, sales Tax, use Tax, stamp
Tax, stock transfer Tax, or other similar Tax imposed on the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and
fifty percent (50%) by Seller.

(f) All tax sharing agreements involving HLIKK shall be terminated as of the
Effective Time and, on and after the Closing Date, HLIKK shall not be bound
thereby or have any rights or liabilities thereunder.

Section 10.02 Tax Returns.

(a) Seller shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking into
account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns due before the
Closing Date, and in each case Seller shall remit or cause to be remitted any
Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns, and Buyer shall timely file or cause
to be timely filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly
obtained) all other Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to HLIKK and Buyer shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due
in respect of such Tax Returns. With respect to Tax Returns to be filed by
Buyer pursuant to the preceding sentence that relate to Pre-Closing Taxable
Periods or Straddle Periods (i) such Tax Returns shall be filed in a manner
consistent with past practice and no position shall be taken, election made or
method adopted that is inconsistent with reasonable positions taken, elections
made or methods used in prior periods in filing such Tax Returns (including,
without limitation, any position which would have the effect of accelerating
income to periods for which Seller is liable or deferring deductions to
periods for which Buyer is liable) and (ii) such Tax Returns shall be
submitted to Seller not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for
filing such Tax Returns (or, if such due date is within forty-five (45) days
following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing
Date) for review and comment by Seller, and Buyer shall make such revisions to
such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Seller or which are consistent
with the requirements of clause (i) of this sentence.

(b) Seller or Buyer shall pay the other party for the Taxes for which Seller
or Buyer, respectively, is liable pursuant to Section 10.01 but which are
payable with any Tax Return to be filed by the other party pursuant to Section
10.02(a) upon the written request of the party entitled to payment, setting
forth in detail the computation of the amount owed by Seller or Buyer,

 as the case may be, but in no event later than five (5) days prior to the due
date for paying such Taxes.

(c) Except where required by a Tax Authority as a result of any action, suit,
investigation or audit by such Tax Authority, none of Buyer or any Affiliate
of Buyer shall (or shall cause or permit HLIKK to) amend, refile or otherwise
modify (or grant an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to)
any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to HLIKK with respect to any Pre-
Closing Taxable Periods (or with respect to any Straddle Period) without the
prior written consent of Seller, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld but which may in all events be withheld if such action would increase
the amount of Taxes for which Seller may be liable pursuant to Section
10.01(a) or Section 10.01(f).

Section 10.03 Contest Provisions. Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in
writing upon receipt by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or HLIKK of notice of any
pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits,
examinations or assessments which might affect the Tax liabilities for which
Seller may be liable pursuant to Section 10.01(a). Except as provided in the
next succeeding sentence with respect to Straddle Periods, Seller shall have
the sole right to represent HLIKK's interests in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding relating to Pre-Closing Taxable Periods or
otherwise relating to Taxes for which Seller may be liable pursuant to Section
10.01(a), and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. In the case of a
Straddle Period, Seller shall be entitled to participate at its expense in any
Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating (in whole or in part)
to Taxes attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the day
before the Closing Date and, with the written consent of Buyer, and at
Seller's sole expense, may assume the entire control of such audit or
proceeding. None of Buyer, any of its Affiliates or HLIKK may settle any Tax
claim for any Taxes for which Seller may be liable pursuant to Section
10.01(a), without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may not
be unreasonably withheld by Seller.

Section 10.04 Assistance and Cooperation. On and after the Closing Date, each
of Seller and Buyer shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to):

(a) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party
is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with Section 10.02;

(b) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with Tax
authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of HLIKK;

(c) make available to the other and to any Tax Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of HLIKK;

(d) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or threatened
Tax audits or assessments of HLIKK for taxable periods for which the other may
have a liability under Section 10.01;

 (e) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any Tax
Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with respect
to any taxable periods for which the other may have a liability under Section
10.01;

(f) Buyer shall cause HLIKK to provide to Seller any financial and tax
information of HLIKK reasonably necessary for Seller to determine its U.S.
federal income tax liability (including any tax credits) for the taxable year
of the Seller that includes the Closing Date;

(g) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax
Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes described in Section 10.01(e)
(relating to sales, transfer and similar Taxes); and

(h) timely provide to the other powers of attorney or similar authorizations
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Article X.

Section 10.05 Other Tax Matters.

(a) The indemnification provided for in this Article X shall be the sole
remedy for any claim in respect of Taxes and the provisions of Article XIII
shall not apply to such claims, except as expressly provided. Indemnification
provided for in this Article X shall be calculated on an After-Tax Basis.

(b) Any claim for indemnity under this Article X may only be made at a time
prior to sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable Tax statute of
limitations with respect to the relevant taxable period (including all periods
of extension, whether automatic or permissive).

(c) The parties shall treat any indemnification payment made under this
Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(d) Seller and Buyer agree that none of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer shall
make, nor cause or permit to be made, any election under Section 338 of the
Code or under any applicable similar prohibition of state or foreign law with
respect to HLIKK, without the express written consent of Seller.

indemnification obligation of Seller under Section 13.01(a)(i) or Section
13.01(a)(ii) solely with respect to a breach or failure by Seller to perform
its covenants or obligations under Section 7.09 shall in no event exceed
$320,000,000 (other than in respect of Losses arising solely as a result of
the inaccuracy or breach of any Seller Fundamental Representation); provided,
however, that the limitations contained in this Section 13.01(b) shall not
apply to Losses arising out of criminal activity or actual fraud that is
intended to affect the other party.

Section 13.02 Indemnification by Buyer.

(a) After the Closing and subject to Article X, the other provisions of this
Article XIII and Section 14.01, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
and its Affiliates (but not HLIKK) and Representatives (collectively, the
"Seller Indemnified Parties") against, and reimburse any Seller Indemnified
Party for, all Losses that such Seller Indemnified Party may at any time
suffers or incurs, or becomes subject to, as a result of or in connection
with:

 (i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty, in each case,
as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date (or if made as of
a specified date, only as of such date) made by Buyer in Article VI of this
Agreement (determined without regard to any qualification or references to
"Buyer Material Adverse Effect," "material," "materially," "in all material
respects" or other materiality or similar qualifications or references
contained in any representation or warranty); or

(ii) any breach or failure by Buyer to perform any of its covenants or
obligations contained in this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, Buyer shall not be
required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Seller Indemnified Party
against, or reimburse any Seller Indemnified Party for, any Losses pursuant to
Section 13.02(a)(i) (other than Losses arising solely as a result of the
inaccuracy or breach of any Buyer Fundamental Representation, as to which this
Section 13.02(b) shall not apply) (i) with respect to any claim (or series of
related claims arising from the same underlying facts, events or
circumstances), unless such claim (or series of related claims arising from
the same underlying facts, events or circumstances) involves Losses in excess
of ¥5,000,000 (nor shall any such item that does not meet the ¥5,000,000
threshold be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the
aggregate amount of the Seller Indemnified Parties' Losses for which Buyer has
responsibility under clause (ii) below) and (ii) until the aggregate amount of
the Seller Indemnified Parties' Losses exceeds $9,000,000, after which Buyer
shall be obligated for all such Losses of the Seller Indemnified Parties that,
in the aggregate, are in excess of such amount. The cumulative aggregate
indemnification obligation of Buyer under Section 13.02(a)(i) shall in no
event exceed $320,000,000 (other than in respect of Losses arising solely as a
result of the inaccuracy or breach of any Buyer Fundamental Representation);
provided, however, that the limitations contained in this Section 13.02(b)
shall not apply to Losses arising out of criminal activity or actual fraud
that is intended to affect the other party.

Section 13.03 Notification of Claims.

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
"Indemnified Party"), shall promptly notify the party or parties liable for
such indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of any pending or
threatened claim or demand by a third party that the Indemnified Party has
determined has given or could reasonably give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending or threatened claim
or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party, such claim
being a "Third Party Claim"), describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand and
the specific representation, warranty or provision of this Agreement that the
Indemnified Party assumes to be breached; provided, however, that the failure
to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of
its obligations under this Article XIII except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced by such failure, it being understood that notices for
claims in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival
period specified in Section 14.01 for such representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement (except in respect of Losses arising out of criminal activity or
actual fraud that is intended to affect the other party); provided, further,
that if, prior to such applicable

 date, a party hereto shall have notified the other party hereto in accordance
with the requirements of this Section 13.03(a) of a claim for indemnification
under this Article XIII (whether or not formal legal action shall have been
commenced based upon such claim), such claim shall continue to be subject to
indemnification in accordance with this Article XIII notwithstanding the
passing of such applicable date.

(b) Following receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to Section 13.03(a), with respect to any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party, by notice to the Indemnified Party, may assume the defense
and control of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity
to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel
and at its own expense. Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate fully with the
Indemnifying Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, without the consent of any
Indemnified Party, provided that (i) such settlement does not involve any
finding or admission of any violation of Law on the part of the Indemnified
Party, (ii) the Indemnifying Party pays or causes to be paid all amounts
arising out of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness
of such settlement (other than as contemplated by Section 13.01(b) or
13.02(b), (iii) such settlement does not encumber any of the material assets
of any Indemnified Party or agree to any restriction or condition that would
apply to or materially adversely affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct
of any Indemnified Party's business and (iv) the Indemnifying Party obtains,
as a condition of any settlement or other resolution, a complete and
unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from any and all liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim.

(c) No Indemnifying Party shall have any liability under this Article XIII for
any Losses arising out of or in connection with any Third Party Claim that is
settled by an Indemnified Party without the prior consent of such Indemnifying
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(d) If an Indemnified Party shall have a claim for indemnification hereunder
for any claim other than a Third Party Claim (such claim, a "Direct Claim"),
the Indemnified Party shall, as promptly as is practicable give written notice
to the Indemnifying Party setting forth (i) a detailed description of the
claim, (ii) a good faith estimate of the amount of the claim, and (iii) the
specific representation, warranty or provision of this Agreement that the
Indemnified Party assumes to be breached. The Indemnifying Party shall have
sixty (60) days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such
Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its
professional advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to
give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is
payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist
the Indemnifying Party's investigation by giving such information and
assistance (including access to HLIKK's books and records) as the Indemnifying
Party or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such sixty (60) day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case
the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as

 may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the
provisions of this Agreement.

(e) If there shall be any conflict between the provisions of this Section
13.03 and Section 10.03 (relating to Tax contests), the provisions of Section
10.03 shall control with respect to Tax contests.

Section 13.04 Payment. In the event an Action for indemnification under this
Article XIII shall have been finally determined, the amount of such final
determination shall be paid to the Indemnified Party, on demand in immediately
available funds. An Action, and the liability for and amount of damages
therefor, shall be deemed to be "finally determined" for purposes of this
Article XIII when the parties to such Action have so determined by mutual
agreement or, if disputed, when a final nonappealable Governmental Order shall
have been entered.

Section 13.05 No Duplication; Exclusive Remedies. Each of Seller and Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that:

(a) any liability for indemnification hereunder and under any other
Transaction Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by
reason of the same Loss;

(b) prior to the Closing, other than in the case of criminal activity or
actual fraud by Buyer or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates that is
intended to affect the other party, the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer for
any breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty or covenant contained
in this Agreement or any certificate or instrument delivered hereunder shall
be refusal to close the purchase and sale of the Shares hereunder; and

(c) following the Closing, other than in the case of criminal activity or
actual fraud by Buyer or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates that is
intended to affect the other party, and except for breaches or non-performance
of provisions in this Agreement for which the remedy of specific performance
is available pursuant to Section 14.14, the indemnification provisions of
Article XIII and, with respect to Taxes, Article X, shall be the sole and
exclusive remedies of Seller and Buyer, respectively, for any breach of the
representations or warranties in this Agreement or any other document,
instrument or certificate delivered hereunder and for any failure to perform
or comply with any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

Section 13.06 Additional Indemnification Provisions.

(a) Seller and Buyer agree, for themselves and on behalf of their respective
Affiliates and Representatives, that with respect to each indemnification
obligation in this Agreement, any Transaction Agreement or any other document,
instrument or certificate executed or delivered in connection with the Closing
(i) each such obligation shall be calculated on an After-Tax Basis, (ii) all
Losses shall be net of any Eligible Insurance Proceeds (as set forth in
Section 13.06(e) below), (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify the
Indemnified Party for punitive, exemplary, indirect, consequential or other
special damages or lost profits for which a valid indemnification claim is
made hereunder only to the extent paid to an unaffiliated third party or
Governmental Authority and (iv) in no event shall Seller have any liability or
obligation to any

 Buyer Indemnified Person to the extent that any Loss, or portion thereof, as
applicable, for which indemnification is sought hereunder is reflected or
reserved for or otherwise taken into account in determining the Final Net
Worth, Final HLIC Recapture Payment or Final Net Monthly Settlement Balances.

(b) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from a third Person any
amount in respect of any Loss for which an Indemnifying Party has reimbursed
it pursuant to this Article XIII, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay
over to the Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after deducting
therefrom the amount of expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery),
but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously paid by the
Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such
claim and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnifying Party in pursuing or
defending any claim arising out of such matter.

(c) If any portion of Losses to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Article XIII could be recovered from a third party not
affiliated with the relevant Indemnified Party based on the underlying claim
or demand asserted against such Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party
shall promptly give notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party and, after
payment of such Losses in full to the Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying
Party and upon the reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, shall (unless
inconsistent with any applicable Law) use reasonable best efforts to collect
the maximum amount recoverable from such third party, in which event the
Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all reasonable
costs incurred in connection with such collection. If any portion of Losses
actually paid by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article XIII could
have been recovered from a third party not affiliated with the relevant
Indemnified Party based on the underlying claim or demand asserted against
such Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall transfer, to the
extent transferable under applicable Law, such of its rights to proceed
against such third party as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to
recover from such third party such portion actually paid by the Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Article XIII. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Section 13.06(c) shall not apply to any amounts payable to Buyer Reinsurer
pursuant to the Berkshire Retrocession Agreement.

(d) The parties shall treat any indemnification payment made under this
Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(e) If any portion of Losses to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party may be
covered, in whole or in part, by third-party insurance coverage (each, an
"Insurance Policy"), the Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice thereof
to the Indemnifying Party (a "Notice of Insurance"). "Insurance Policies" do
not include reinsurance or retrocession arrangements. The Indemnified Party
shall use all reasonable best efforts to collect the maximum amount of
insurance proceeds thereunder, and all such proceeds actually received shall
be considered "Eligible Insurance Proceeds".

(f) Seller acknowledges and agrees that Berkshire shall have the right to
indemnification from Seller pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement.

Section 13.07 Reserves. Except as set forth in Section 5.21, 5.29(e), or 5.30
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the other
Transaction Agreements,

 Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller makes no representation or warranty
with respect to, and nothing contained in this Agreement, any other
Transaction Agreements, or in any other agreement, document, instrument or
certificate to be delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby is intended or shall be construed to be a representation or
warranty (express or implied) of Seller, for any purpose of this Agreement,
the other Transaction Agreements, or any other agreement, document, instrument
or certificate to be delivered in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, with respect to (a) the adequacy or
sufficiency of the reserves of HLIKK, (b) whether or not the reserves of HLIKK
were determined in accordance with any actuarial, statutory or other standard,
and (c) the effect of the adequacy or sufficiency of the reserves of HLIKK on
any "line item" or asset, liability or equity amount. Furthermore, except as
set forth in Section 5.21, 5.29(e), or 5.30 Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
no fact, condition, circumstance or event relating to or affecting the
development of the reserves of HLIKK may be used, directly or indirectly, to
demonstrate or support the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement, any other Transaction Agreement, or any
other agreement, document, instrument or certificate to be delivered in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

ARTICLE XIV

Section 14.04 Public Announcements. Prior to Closing, no party to this

Agreement or any Affiliate or Representative of such party shall issue or
cause the publication of

any press release or public announcement or otherwise communicate with any
news media in

respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior

written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed),

except as may be required by Law or applicable securities exchange rules, in
which the case the

party required to publish such press release or public announcement shall
allow the other parties

a reasonable opportunity to comment on such press release or public
announcement in advance

of such publication. Neither of the parties to this Agreement, nor any of
their respective

Affiliates or Representatives, shall make any disclosure concerning plans or
intentions relating to

the customers, agents or employees of, or other Persons with significant
business relationships

with, HLIKK without first obtaining the prior written approval of the other
party, which approval

will not be unreasonably withheld.



Section 14.05 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is

invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or as a matter
of public policy, all

other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and

effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this

Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such

determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced,

the parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to

effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in

order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as
originally

contemplated to the greatest extent possible.



Section 14.06 Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the

Transaction Agreements, the Transaction Agreements constitute the entire
agreement of the

parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of the Transaction
Agreements and supersede all

prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral (other than the
Confidentiality

 Agreement to the extent not in conflict with this Agreement), between or on
behalf of Seller

and/or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and/or its Affiliates, on
the other hand, with

respect to the subject matter of the Transaction Agreements.



Section 14.07 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Any
attempted assignment in violation of this Section 14.07 shall be void. This
Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns.

Section 14.08 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Article XIII
with respect to the Seller Indemnified Parties and Buyer Indemnified Parties,
this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and
their permitted successors and assigns and nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person or entity any
legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement.

Section 14.09 Amendment. No provision of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified except by a
written instrument signed by all the parties to such agreement.

Section 14.10 Schedules. Any disclosure with respect to any Section of this
Agreement shall be deemed to be disclosed for purposes of other Sections of
this Agreement to the extent that such disclosure sets forth facts in
sufficient detail so that the relevance of such disclosure would be reasonably
apparent to a reader of such disclosure. Matters reflected in any Schedule of
this Agreement are not necessarily limited to matters required by this
Agreement to be so reflected. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in
any Schedule of this Agreement shall be construed as an admission or
indication that such item or other matter is material or that such item or
other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, no such reference to or disclosure of a
possible breach or violation of any contract, Law or Governmental Order shall
be construed as an admission or indication that breach or violation exists or
has actually occurred.

Section 14.11 Dispute Resolution; Submission to Jurisdiction. Subject to
Section 2.04:

(a) Any claim, dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, including the formation, performance, breach, termination,
enforceability, interpretation or validity of this Agreement, shall be fully
and finally resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC Rules") by a
tribunal of three arbitrators. The arbitral tribunal shall be constituted as
follows: each of Buyer and Seller shall nominate one arbitrator in accordance
with the ICC Rules and the two party-nominated arbitrators shall then nominate
the third arbitrator who shall act as the president of the tribunal. Each of
the three arbitrators shall be fluent in English and shall be admitted to
practice law in the State of New

 York with at least fifteen years of experience as a practicing attorney
litigating or arbitrating disputes with respect to corporate mergers and
acquisitions or other commercial transactions governed by New York law. The
place of arbitration shall be the Republic of Singapore or such other location
agreed by the parties. The language of the arbitration shall be English and
all written submissions to the arbitral tribunal, as well as all orders and
awards of the arbitral tribunal, shall be in English. At the request of either
party, there shall be simultaneous English and Japanese translation at any
oral hearings before the arbitral tribunal. The cost of any arbitration
hereunder, including the cost of any translation, will be shared equally by
the parties, provided each party shall bear the costs and expenses of its own
attorneys and witnesses. Where a breach or failure to perform any covenant or
obligation in this Agreement has been established, the arbitral tribunal shall
have the authority to, upon the request of an aggrieved party, render an award
for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided in Section 14.14, such
remedy being in addition to any other remedy to which any party may be
entitled at law or in equity. Any award of the arbitral tribunal shall be
final and binding on the parties and judgment may be entered on the award in
any court of competent jurisdiction. Except as contemplated by Section
13.06(a)(iii), the arbitral tribunal shall have no authority to award treble,
exemplary, special, punitive or similar damages.

(b) Each of Seller and Buyer irrevocably and unconditionally:

(i) submits for itself and its property in any Action relating to the
recognition or enforcement of any award issued by an arbitral tribunal
pursuant to Section 14.11(a), to the jurisdiction of the courts of Tokyo,
Japan and the State of New York sitting in the County of New York and the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and agrees
that all claims in respect of any such Action may be heard and determined in
such Japanese or New York courts or, to the extent permitted by law, in such
federal court;

(ii) waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, (x) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the courts in Japan or New York as described in this Agreement for any
reason (other than a failure to serve process as described in Section
14.11(b)(iii)), (y) that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (z) that (A) the Action in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Action is improper or (C) an
arbitration award issued pursuant to Section 14.11(a) may not be enforced in
or by such courts;

(iii) agrees that notice delivered as provided in this Agreement shall
constitute sufficient service of process for purposes of any Action brought by
any party or its Affiliates or successors and assigns, and each party further
waives and agrees not to assert any argument that such service is
insufficient; and

 (iv) agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by the Laws of the State of
New York or Japan.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnification Agreement sets forth
additional requirements that govern certain arbitration provisions hereunder.

Section 14.12 Governing Law. This Agreement shall in all respects be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles of such state to the
extent such principles would require or permit the application of the Laws of
another jurisdiction.

Section 14.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, OR ITS PERFORMANCE UNDER OR THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 14.14 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement
are not performed in accordance with their specific wording or are otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall be
entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or remedy any
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in connection with any arbitration proceeding commenced
pursuant to Section 14.11(a), such remedy being in addition to any other
remedy to which any party may be entitled at law or in equity.

Section 14.15 Rules of Construction. Interpretation of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements (except as specifically provided in any such
agreement, in which case such specified rules of construction shall govern
with respect to such agreement) shall be governed by the following rules of
construction: (a) words in the singular shall be held to include the plural

gender as the context requires; (b) references to Articles, Sections,

paragraphs, Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement unless otherwise
specified; (c) references to "$" shall mean United States dollars and
references to "¥" shall mean Japanese yen; (d) the word "including" and words
of similar import when used in the Transaction Agreements shall mean
"including without limiting the generality of the foregoing," unless otherwise
specified; (e) the word "or" shall not be exclusive; (f) the headings
contained in the Transaction Agreements are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of the Transaction
Agreements; (g) the Transaction Agreements shall be construed without regard
to any presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against
the party drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted; and (h) unless
otherwise specified, references to dates and times are to dates and times in
Tokyo, Japan.

Section 14.16 Buyer Parent. Buyer Parent shall be a party to this Agreement
solely for the purposes of Sections 6.01, 6.02, 6.03, 7.03 (to the extent
relating to Governmental Approvals

 that Buyer Parent is required to obtain), 7.07, 7.08, 8.03, 8.09, and 8.11 and
Articles 13 (provided, that (x) Section 13.02(a)(i) shall only apply to Buyer
Parent with respect to any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
warranty made by Buyer Parent in Sections 6.01, 6.02, and 6.03 and Buyer's and
Buyer Parent's indemnification obligations thereunder shall be several but not
joint, and (y) Section 13.02(a)(ii) shall only apply to Buyer Parent with
respect to any breach or failure by Buyer Parent to perform any of its
covenants or obligations contained in Sections 7.03, 7.07, 7.08, 8.03, 8.09

thereunder shall be several but not joint, and 14 (collectively, the "Buyer
Parent Matters"), and solely for the purposes of such Articles and Sections,
