Capital and Retained Cash Balances set forth in the Estimated Closing
Statement was the actual amount of Closing

  



        
   

  



  

### Working Capital and Retained Cash Balances. The Purchase Price as so

receipt of the Final Closing Statement that it accepts the Final Closing
Statement or that there is a dispute as to an item reflected thereon.  Such
notice will set forth SellerÂ’s objections, if any, to the Final Closing
Statement in reasonable detail.  The failure by Seller to give Buyer such
notice within such period shall be deemed to constitute SellerÂ’s acceptance
of the Final Closing Statement. The parties will use all reasonable efforts
to resolve any such dispute, but if such dispute cannot be resolved by the
parties within forty-five (45) days after Seller gives notice of such
dispute, it shall be referred to KPMG LLP (the " _Selected Accountants_
") pursuant to a writing signed by Buyer and Seller adequately describing
the dispute. The Selected Accountants

  



        
   

  



  

### shall have authority to resolve the dispute described in the writing and

respect to such dispute shall be conclusive and binding on each party. The
fees and expenses of the Selected Accountants shall be shared equally by
Seller and Buyer.

  

### 

  

### (e) If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this Section
1.5 (i) is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to Buyer

Price, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the excess.  Any such
payment pursuant to the preceding sentence will be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to an account (or accounts) designated by Buyer
or Seller, as the case may be, on the later of (x) the second (2nd) Business
Day after acceptance by Seller of the Final Closing Statement or (y)
the second (2nd) Business Day following resolution (as contemplated by
paragraph (d) above) of any dispute concerning the Final Closing Statement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the parties are disputing the final
calculation of the Purchase Price, to the extent part of any payment that
would be payable pursuant to this paragraph (e) is not in dispute, the payor
shall pay the amount not in dispute on the date the payment would otherwise
be due but for such dispute by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by the recipient. All payments made pursuant
to this paragraph (e) shall be accompanied by interest at a rate equal to
5% per annum from the Closing Date through (but excluding) the date such
payment is made.

# _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER_

  



  

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter, Seller hereby represents and
warrants to Buyer as follows:

  



        
   

  



  

## 2.1 _Organization and Good Standing_. Seller is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware. Each of the other Rockwood Sellers is a corporation (or other
Person) validly existing and (if such Person is organized in a jurisdiction
in which the concept of good standing or its functional equivalent is
applicable) in good standing or its functional equivalent under the Laws of
its jurisdiction of organization. _Schedule 2.1 of the Disclosure Letter_
 lists each Subsidiary of each Company (together with the Companies, the "
_Transferred Companies_ ") and the business entity form and place of
organization for each of the Transferred Companies. Each Transferred Company
is (x) validly existing and (if such Transferred Company is organized in a
jurisdiction in which the concept of good standing or its functional
equivalent is applicable) in good standing or its functional equivalent under
the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and (y) qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and (if such concept of good standing or
its functional equivalent is applicable in such jurisdiction) in
good standing or its functional equivalent in each jurisdiction in which the
conduct of its business or the ownership of its Assets requires such
qualification, except for such failures to be so qualified and in good
standing or its functional equivalent which would not be reasonably expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Transferred Company has the
corporate (or other equivalent) authority under the Laws pursuant to which it
is organized to own or lease the Assets owned or leased by it and to carry on
its business as now being conducted by it. Seller has made available to Buyer
true and complete copies of each Transferred CompaniesÂ’ articles of
incorporation and by-laws (or other comparable governing instruments) and all
amendments thereto to the date hereof, as in effect on the date hereof. The
minute books (containing the records of meetings (and actions by written
consent in lieu of meetings) of the stockholders, the board of directors, and
any committees of

  



        
   

  



  

## the board of directors), the stock certificate books and the stock record
books of each of the Transferred Companies have been made available for
inspection by Buyer prior to the date hereof.

  

## 

  

## 2.2 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock, share capital or other
equity interests of each Transferred Company and the number of shares of such
stock or capital or equity interests that are issued and outstanding, and any
such stock or equity interests held by the applicable Transferred Company as
treasury stock, are set forth on _Schedule 2.2 of the Disclosure Letter_.
There are no other shares of capital stock or other equity securities of any
Transferred Company issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding.  The
ownership of all issued and outstanding shares or other equity interests of
the Transferred Companies is set forth in _Schedule 2.2 of the Disclosure
Letter_. All the Shares and Subsidiary Shares have been validly authorized
and issued, are fully paid and, in respect of such jurisdictions where such
concept is applicable, nonassessable and have not been issued in violation of
any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right,
subscription right or any similar right under any organizational document of
any Transferred Company, any applicable Law or any Contract to which any
Rockwood Seller or Transferred Company is a party or otherwise bound.  There
are not any bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of any Transferred
Company having the right to vote, or convertible into, or exchangeable for,
securities having the right to vote, on any matters on which holders of
Shares or Subsidiary Shares may vote (" _Voting Debt_ "). There are not any
options, warrants, calls, rights, convertible or exchangeable securities,
stock appreciation rights, stock-based performance units, commitments or
Contracts of any kind to which any Transferred Company is a party or by which
any of them is bound (i) obligating any Transferred Company to issue, deliver
or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of

  



        
   

  



  

## capital stock or other equity interests in, or any security convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for any capital stock of or other equity
interest in, any Transferred Company or any Voting Debt, (ii) obligating any
Transferred Company to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such option,
warrant, call, right, security, unit, commitment or Contract or (iii) that
give any Person the right to receive any economic benefit or right similar to
or derived from the economic benefits and rights occurring to holders of
Shares or Subsidiary Shares. There are not any outstanding
contractual obligations (contingent or otherwise) of any Transferred Company
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of any
Transferred Company. No Transferred Company is a party to, or otherwise
bound by, any voting trust, proxy or other Contract, restricting or otherwise
relating to the voting, dividend rights or disposition of any Shares or
Subsidiary Shares.  Except for their interests in the Subsidiaries set forth
in _Schedule 2.2 of the Disclosure Letter_ , none of the Transferred
Companies own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership
interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or other equity
interests in any Person. The Transferred Companies have, and at the Closing
will have, good and valid title to the Subsidiary Shares, free and clear of
any Liens. The Rockwood Sellers (and Taiwan Nominee Shareholders) have, and
will transfer to Buyer at the Closing, good and valid title to the Shares,
free and clear of any Liens.

Company, (ii) any Contract to which any Rockwood Seller is a party or by
which any of their respective Assets is bound or (iii) any Order or Law
applicable to any Rockwood Seller or any Transferred Company or their
respective Assets.  No Approval or material Consent is required to be

transactions. Seller and Buyer shall permit counsel for the other party
reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the

party the opportunity to attend and participate.

Electronic following the Closing. In connection therewith and subject to
the consent and agreement of the current landlord of the Wafer Reclaim Area
Lease, Walbrook Trustees (Jersey) Limited and Walbrook Properties Limited,
the parties will seek to take the following steps in relation to the Wafer
Reclaim Area Lease and the Ultra Pure Chemicals Lease prior to the Closing:

  

### 

  

#### (i) Seller will use reasonable efforts to seek to (1) agree with the
landlord of the Wafer Reclaim Area Lease to either (x) a surrender of the
part of the area currently demised on which the Ultra Pure Chemicals effluent
treatment plant is located (the " _Effluent Treatment Plant_ ") and agree
upon a new lease for a term coterminous with the term of the Ultra Pure
Chemicals Lease to Rockwood Electronic of the surrendered area on which the
Effluent Treatment Plant is situated (the " _New Lease_ ") or (y) vary the
boundary between the Wafer Reclaim Area Lease and the Ultra Pure
Chemicals Lease such that the Effluent Treatment Plant is subject to the
Ultra Pure Chemicals Lease, (2) assign the Wafer Reclaim Area Lease to
Excalibur Realty UK Limited and (3) have the rents on the leases adjusted so
that the total rent cost under the Ultra Pure Chemicals Lease and the New
Lease equal the rent that would have been paid on the Ultra Pure Chemicals
lease alone or alternatively cause the surrendered area to be made subject to
the existing Ultra Pure Chemicals Lease without a rent increase.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Seller shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Ultra Pure
Chemicals water treatment plant (the " _Water Treatment Plant_ ") currently
located within the area demised by the Wafer Reclaim Area Lease to be
relocated to an area within the demise of the Ultra Pure Chemicals Lease. The

expense of such relocation to be borne by Seller.

above has not been received prior to the Closing), then the Wafer Reclaim
Area Lease and the Ultra Pure Chemicals Lease shall be retained by Rockwood
Electronic and shall transfer as part of the consummation of the sale of the
Shares of Rockwood Electronic hereunder. In such event, (i) Seller shall be
responsible for all incremental costs to Buyer above the costs that it would
have incurred had the steps proposed in clause (i) above been implemented at
or prior to the Closing during all periods following the Closing in which
such steps are not implemented, (ii) all Losses incurred by Seller
Indemnitees in relation to the premises subject to the Wafer Reclaim Area
Lease (other than the Effluent Treatment Plant) during any period in
which such steps are not implemented shall be deemed to be Retained
Liabilities and (iii) the parties shall continue to use their reasonable
efforts for a period of one year from the Closing to secure such consent and
implement such steps.

before the Closing Date (to the extent Seller so requests), and in any event
within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the release of each of
the obligations of Seller (or any Affiliate thereof, other than
the Transferred Companies) to guaranty any liability of any Transferred
Company, which guarantees are listed on _Schedule 4.12 of the Disclosure
Letter_ and, to that end, shall provide such guarantees or other credit
support as shall be required to obtain such release. If Buyer fails to
obtain any such release or the terms of such release are unreasonable in
SellerÂ’s good faith judgment, Buyer shall enter into an agreement (a "
_Guaranty Agreement_ "), in form reasonably satisfactory to Seller,
containing covenants to indemnify Seller in respect of any liability
or expense incurred by Seller (or an Affiliate thereof, other than the
Transferred Companies) in respect of any claim made in respect of any such
guaranty.

power to reduce the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be

### 

  

### (c) The Seller (where clause (a) applies) and the Buyer (where clause (b)
applies) will procure that:

  



        
   

  



  

(i) Compugraphics shall cease for the purposes of the rules of
the Compugraphics Plan to participate in the Compugraphics Plan immediately

Compugraphics Plan as envisaged by the proviso to clause 24.3 of the
Compugraphics PlanÂ’s definitive deed.

  



  

### (d) Where Compugraphics has not ceased to participate in the

all active membership of the Compugraphics Plan shall terminate prior to the
Closing Date.

after the Closing Date or as a result of Compugraphics taking any other
action (such as augmenting benefits or exercising a discretion to increase
benefits) on or after the Closing Date which results in additional
liabilities accruing in the Compugraphics Plan.

  

### 

        
   

  



  

### (g) In the event that Compugraphics has power to terminate the
Compugraphics Plan on or after Closing Date, the Buyer will procure that such
power is only exercised if instructed in writing by the Seller to exercise
such power.

  

### 

  

### (h) Where Compugraphics holds a discretionary power in relation to the
Compugraphics Plan or the agreement of Compugraphics is required on or after
the Closing Date in respect of any matters to be determined in respect of the
Compugraphics Plan (including agreement to items relating scheme funding set
out in Part 3 of the Pensions Act 2004), the Buyer will procure that
Compugraphics only gives its agreement or exercises its discretion in
accordance with the written instructions of the Seller. The Buyer will also
use all reasonable efforts, where Compugraphics is a participating employer
in the Compugraphics Plan, to facilitate the SellerÂ’s access to the trustees
of the Compugraphics Plan for the purposes of discussing matters relating to
the Compugraphics Plan.

  

### 

  

### (i) The Seller shall indemnify the Buyer and its Affiliates (including
Compugraphics) and any of their successors (" _Specified Indemnified Parties_
") from and against all Losses of the Specified Indemnified Parties arising
or which may arise, out of or in connection with any liability relating to

(or any statutory modification or re-enactment thereof)) occurring in respect

the extent arising from a breach of clause (e), clause (f), clause (g) or
clause (h).

  

### 

  

### (j) The Seller will use its best efforts to ensure that within three
years of the Closing Date, the assets and liabilities of the Compugraphics
Plan are transferred into another

  

###

no such action shall be required to be taken to the extent that it triggers
a requirement to fund any such transferring liabilities or such receiving
plan on a higher basis than a scheme funding basis.

  

### 

  

### (k) The Seller shall procure that, prior to the Closing Date,
consultation shall be carried out with the employees who are members of the
Compugraphics Plan (the " _Compugraphics Members_ ") to comply, so far as is
possible subject to the other provisions of this Section 4.25 and the
remainder of this clause (k), with the obligations to consult with
Compugraphics Members under section 259 of the Pensions Act 2004, having
first agreed the content of any communications to the Compugraphics Employees
with the Buyer, whose agreement may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

###

indemnification or other claim based upon, resulting from or arising out of a
breach or inaccuracy of such a representation and warranty or under such

### 

  

8.3 _Indemnification Obligations of Buyer_. If the Closing shall occur,
Buyer, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article, shall indemnify

each of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders,
agents, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnitees_ "), on a Net After-Tax Basis against and in respect of any and
all Losses which may be incurred by Seller Indemnitees arising from, relating

to the breach of any of the representations and warranties contained in the
first sentence of Section 2.1 and in Sections 2.2, 2.3(a), 2.7, 2.12, 2.16
and 2.17 (together with the aggregate liability of Seller pursuant to
Sections 8.2(a), (d) and (g)) shall not exceed the Purchase Price;

  

### 

  

### (b) the aggregate liability of Buyer for Losses pursuant to Sections
8.3(a) shall not exceed 20% of the Purchase Price (determined for this
purpose without regard to Retained Cash Balances), except that the aggregate

breach of any of the representations and warranties contained in Section
3.1, 3.2(a), 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 shall not exceed the Purchase Price;

  

### 

        
   

  



  

### (c) no Indemnified Party will be entitled to recover indirect, special,
consequential, incidental, punitive or business interruption damages or lost
revenues, profits, cost savings or synergies pursuant to Sections 8.2(a) or
8.3(a); provided, however, that the parties acknowledge and agree that for
purposes of this Article VIII, any damages actually paid by either of them to
a third party (other than an Affiliate) shall be considered direct damages
for which recovery may be sought in accordance with the terms hereof;

  

### 

  

### (d) no claim for indemnification may be made by a Buyer Indemnitee
pursuant to Section 8.2 or by a Seller Indemnitee pursuant to Section 8.3
unless notice of such claim (describing the basic facts or events, the
existence or occurrence of which constitute or have resulted in the alleged
breach of a representation or warranty made in this Agreement or which
otherwise form the basis of the claim) has been given to the party from whom
indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") during the relevant
survival period set forth in Section 8.1 (which, for purposes of Sections
8.2(a) and 8.3(a), will be the survival period of the representation and
warranty alleged to have been breached);

  

### 

  

### (e) Seller shall have no liability pursuant to Sections 8.2(a) and (d)
(x) for any Losses with respect to an individual matter or series of related
matters until the cumulative aggregate amount of the Losses with respect to
such matter or series of related matters exceeds U.S. $25,000 (the "
_Threshold Amount_ "), in which case the amount of all such Losses (including
those that are less than the Threshold Amount) shall be included for purposes
of computing the Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder and/or applicable
against the Basket Amount pursuant to clause (y) below; and (y) until the
aggregate amount of the Losses of the Buyer Indemnitees for which
indemnification would otherwise be available under Sections 8.2(a) and (d)
exceeds 1% of the Purchase Price (determined for this purpose without regard
to Retained Cash Balances) (the

  

### 

        
   

  



  

### " _Basket Amount_ "), after which Seller will be obligated to indemnify
for only that portion of such Losses of the Buyer Indemnitees Company that
exceed the Basket Amount; provided that the limitations set forth in sub
clause (y) of this paragraph (e) shall not apply to Losses related to the
breach of any of the representations or warranties contained in Sections 2.1,
2.2, 2.3(a), 2.7, 2.12, 2.16 and 2.17; and

  

### 

  

### (f) Seller shall have no liability pursuant to Section 8.2 for any Loss
to the extent a reserve with respect to such Loss is included in or taken
into account in the calculation or determination of Closing Working Capital
or reflected in the Balance Sheet or for any Loss associated with periodic
groundwater monitoring at the St. Cheron and St. Fromond facilities to the
extent such monitoring is in all material respects of the same nature,
magnitude and frequency as that conducted as of the Closing.

  

### 

  

### (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (x) in the
event that Buyer, the Transferred Companies or their Affiliates initiate any
communication with or make any notice to any Person (including Governmental
Authorities) not reasonably required by applicable Environmental Requirements
that could reasonably be expected to result in or prompt Losses for which
indemnification would otherwise be available pursuant to Sections 8.2(d) or
(e) or Section 8.2(a) (in respect of a breach of a representation and
warranty contained in Section 2.14), Seller shall not be responsible (and
shall not indemnify Buyer Indemnitees) for any such Losses and (y) Seller
shall have no liability under Section 8.2(d) and Section 8.2(a) (in respect
of a breach of a representation and warranty contained in Section 2.14) for
Losses to the extent occurring as a result of or triggered by (A) the closure
or demolition after the Closing of any part of any facility of a Transferred
Company, or (B) environmental testing conducted on the

  



        
   

  



  

### Real Property following the Closing, except for such testing required to
be undertaken by applicable Environmental Requirements.

  

### 

  

8.5 _Mitigation and Recovery from Third Parties_.

  



  

### (a) Buyer and Seller shall each take, and shall cause their Affiliates to
take, all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss for which indemnification may
be sought hereunder, and neither Buyer nor Seller shall be liable for any
Loss to the extent the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates shall fail to
comply with this Section 8.5(a).

  

### 

  

### (b) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under
this Article VIII (before giving effect to the other limitations on
indemnification set forth in this Article VIII) shall be net of any amounts
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof) under
insurance policies, or otherwise actually recovered by the Indemnified Party
(or any Affiliate thereof) from other Persons (net of any costs incurred for
the recovery of such amounts), with respect to such Loss. Buyer and Seller
each agree that, unless the other party shall otherwise direct in writing, it
will (and cause its Affiliates to) use reasonable efforts to recover any such
amounts to the extent such recoveries would reduce amounts required to be
paid by the other party pursuant to this Article VIII.

  

### 

  

8.6 _Procedure_.

  



  

### (a) Any claim for indemnification under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 will
be made in accordance with this Section 8.6. In the case of any claim for
indemnification arising from a claim or demand of a third Person (a " _Third-
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party will give prompt written notice, and
in any event no more than ten (10) days following such Indemnified
PartyÂ’s receipt of such claim or demand, to the Indemnifying Party describing
in reasonable detail the basis of such claim or demand as to which it may
request indemnification

  



        
   

  



  

### hereunder, _provided_ that the failure to notify or delay in notifying an
Indemnifying Party as provided in this sentence or the next sentence will not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations pursuant to Sections 8.2 or
8.3 above, as applicable, except to the extent that such failure actually
prejudices the Indemnifying Party (it being understood that any claim for
indemnity pursuant to Sections 8.2 or 8.3 above must be made by notice given
as provided in this sentence or the next sentence within the applicable
survival period specified in Section 8.1 above).

  

### 

  

### (b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume sole control over the defense, settlement,
management and handling of the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Party so
long as (i) the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing
within 30 days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third
Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such
claim, (ii) such notice provides that the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify
(subject to Section 8.4) the Indemnified Party from and against all Losses
the Indemnified Party may suffer arising from, relating to or otherwise in
respect of such Third Party Claim, and (iii) the Third Party Claim involves
only money damages and does not seek injunctive or other equitable relief
from an Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , the Indemnifying Party
will have no indemnification obligations with respect to any such Third Party
Claim which is settled by the Indemnified Party without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). Should the Indemnifying Party so elect
to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses

  



        
   

  



  

### subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof.  If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate (but not control) in
the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from
the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party
chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the Indemnified
Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s
request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnifying Party
may not settle or compromise any such claim or demand without the consent of
the Indemnified Party (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) if injunctive or other equitable relief would be
imposed against the Indemnified Party as a result thereof, and any such
settlement or compromise shall provide for a full and unconditional discharge
and release of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim
(given against a customary cross-release). In the event the Indemnifying
Party shall fail to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim as provided
herein, the Indemnified Party may defend against the Third Party Claim and
the Indemnifying Party will remain responsible for any Losses the Indemnified
Party may suffer arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of such
Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided by this Article VIII; 
_provided_ , _however_ , the Indemnifying Party will have no indemnification
obligations with respect to any such Third Party Claim which is settled by
the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned).

  



         
 

  

### 

  

### (c) Any investigatory, remedial, cleanup, corrective or compliance action
taken pursuant to Environmental Requirements in connection with any Third
Party Claim arising under Section 8.2(d) and Section 8.2(a) (in respect of a
breach of a representation and warranty contained in Section 2.14 related to
the Real Property) shall be conducted in a commercially reasonable manner and
be deemed to have been adequately completed to the extent that it attains
compliance with action levels and clean up standards applicable to industrial
properties under relevant Environmental Requirements, unless a more stringent
action level or clean-up standard is required under any lawful order or
directive of an appropriate Governmental Authority, or a less stringent
action level or clean-up standard is authorized by a Governmental Authority
with jurisdiction over such matter.

  

### 

  

### (d) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under this Article VIII that does not involve a Third
Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim
with as promptly as practicable after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of
the claim to the Indemnifying Party. Subject to Section 8.1, the failure
by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to such
Indemnified Party under this Article VIII, except to the extent that such
failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party.  Upon receipt of any
notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its responsibility for all or a
portion of the liability to the Indemnified Party under this Article VIII,
the parties will negotiate in good faith to resolve, as promptly as possible,
any such dispute.

## 8.7 _Further Limitations on Indemnification_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The rights of the parties under Section 4.25 and Article VIII and
Article IX will be the exclusive remedy of the parties with respect to
breaches of representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
or made pursuant to this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (b) Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (and from and after the
Closing, the Transferred Companies) and their respective shareholders,
managers, officers, directors, employees and agents), hereby to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law waives and releases Seller and its
Affiliates (and their respective shareholders, managers, officers, directors,
employees and agents) from any statutory or other rights of contribution or
indemnity (except as set forth in Sections 1.5 or 4.25, this Article VIII and
Article IX and claims or causes of action arising from fraud and claims or
causes of action with respect to any breach of any covenant or agreement to
be performed after the Closing) with respect to SellerÂ’s ownership of the
Shares or control or operation of, or otherwise relating to, the Transferred
Companies and the Business.  Buyer consents to the execution by the
Transferred Companies prior to or at the Closing of an instrument by which
they agree to be bound by the provisions of (and in any event waive and
release those matters specified in) this Section 8.7(b) to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law.

  

### 

  

### (c) Each Rockwood Seller, effective upon the Closing, hereby fully,
finally and forever releases, discharges and covenants not to sue and
otherwise agrees not to enforce any claim, cause of action, right, title or
interest against, any Transferred Company and each director, officer and
employee of each Transferred Company and their respective successors and
permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Released Persons_ "), of, from and
with respect to any and all claims, debts, covenants,
agreements, obligations, Liabilities, actions or demands of any

  



        
   

  



  

### kind or character, based upon any fact or circumstance, whether known or
unknown, suspected or unsuspected, which presently exists or has ever existed
in the past, that such Rockwood Sellers have or may have in any manner
whatsoever, either singly or jointly with others against any of the Released
Persons; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Rockwood Sellers are not releasing
any claims related to the enforcement of this Agreement or accounts payable
included in the calculation of Closing Working Capital.

  

### 

  

### (d) In the event that an Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnifying Party will,
upon payment of such indemnity, be subrogated to all rights of the
Indemnified Party with respect to claims to which such indemnification
relates.

  

### 

  

### (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Article VIII
shall have no application with respect to indemnification for Taxes, which
shall be covered exclusively by Section 9.1.

  

### 

  

## 8.8 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Any indemnification payment made
pursuant to this Article VIII shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, except to the extent required by Law.

  

## 

  

# _ARTICLE IX_

  



  

# _TAX AND EMPLOYEE MATTERS_

  



  

## 9.1 _Certain Tax Matters_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Seller will cause to be prepared and filed all Income Tax Returns
(including any consolidated, unitary or combined Income Tax Returns) required
to be filed with respect to any Transferred Company for any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date (any such period, a " _Pre-
Closing Period_ "). Buyer will cause to be prepared and filed all Tax
Returns other than Income Tax Returns (any such Tax Returns, " _Non-Income
Tax Returns_ ")

  



        
   

  



  

### required to be filed with respect to any Transferred Company for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period that are due after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) drafts of any such Non-Income Tax Returns shall be provided to
Seller for its review and comment prior to filing and the parties will use
all reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute, but if such dispute cannot be
resolved by the parties within fifteen (15) days after Buyer receives notice
of such dispute, it shall be referred to the Selected Accountants, (ii) such
Non-Income Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law or change in
circumstances, and (iii) Seller may assume responsibility for preparing any
such Non-Income Tax Returns upon notice to Buyer at least thirty (30) days
before any such Non-Income Tax Return is due. Following the Closing,
Seller will pay, and will indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its
Affiliates from and against, on a Net After-Tax Basis, (i) any Taxes imposed
upon any Transferred Company for any Pre-Closing Period (except to the extent
that the liability for such Taxes was included in the calculation of Closing
Working Capital) and (ii) any Taxes allocable to a Pre-Closing Period or
the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date resulting from
the Restructurings or any check-the-box election made by Seller or its
Affiliates for the French Transferred Company or any foreign Transferred
Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Buyer will pay, and will indemnify
and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against, on a Net After-
Tax Basis, any such Taxes imposed as a result of any action outside the
ordinary course of business after the Closing effected by Buyer or its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) or any
Tax election made by Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Transferred Companies), except for any such election directed by Seller.
 Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Transferred Companies) shall amend any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Period if
such amendment could

  



        
   

  



  

### reasonably be expected to affect SellerÂ’s liability for Taxes for any
Pre-Closing Period or the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date pursuant to Sections 9.1(a) or (b) or the Tax liability of Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Companies) for any period without
SellerÂ’s prior consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or
withheld.

  

### 

  

### (b) Buyer will cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns required to
be filed by or on behalf of any Transferred Company for any taxable period
beginning before and ending after the Closing Date (any such period, a "
_Straddle Period_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that drafts of any such Tax
Returns shall be provided to Seller at least thirty (30) days prior to
filing, and such Tax Returns shall be subject to SellerÂ’s review and
reasonable approval. Except as otherwise consented to by Seller, any such Tax
Returns will be prepared on a basis consistent with the last Tax Returns
previously filed by the Transferred Companies except as required by Law or
change in circumstances. Buyer will pay, and will indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its Affiliates from and against, on a Net After-Tax Basis, any
Taxes imposed upon Seller or its Affiliates for any Straddle Period;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Seller will, within fifteen (15) days after
the date on which the Straddle Period Tax Return is filed, reimburse Buyer
for, and will indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates from and
against, on a Net After-Tax Basis, the amount of Taxes for the Straddle
Period attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date, other than any such Taxes imposed as a result of any action
outside the ordinary course of business effected by Buyer or its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) or any Tax election
made by Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Transferred Companies) which affects the liability of the applicable
Transferred Company for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date, except for any such election directed by Seller. Any Taxes
(including estimated Taxes)

  



        
   

  



  

### paid by the Transferred Companies with respect to any Straddle Period
prior to the Closing shall be credited against SellerÂ’s liability pursuant to
this Section 9.1(b), and, to the extent such prepaid Taxes exceed such
liability, Buyer shall cause the Transferred Companies to pay the excess to
Seller within fifteen (15) days after filing the Tax Return for the Straddle
Period.  Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Transferred Companies) shall amend any Tax Return for a Straddle
Period without SellerÂ’s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
delayed, conditioned or withheld. For purposes of Section 9.1(a) and this
Section 9.1(b), in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis
and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax which relates
to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall (i)
in the case of any Taxes other than sales or use taxes, value-added taxes,
employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax based on or measured by
income, receipts or profits earned (other than conveyances pursuant to this
Agreement, which are governed by Section 9.1(g), be deemed to be the amount
of such Tax for the entire tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of any sales or use taxes, value-
added taxes, employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax based on or
measured by income, receipts or profits earned, be deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable if the relevant tax period ended on the Closing Date,
except that exemptions, allowances and deductions (such as depreciation
deductions) calculated on an annual basis shall be prorated between the
portion of the applicable Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date and
the portion after the Closing Date on a per diem basis.

  



        
   

  



  

### (c) Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its Affiliates from and against, on a Net After-Tax Basis, any
Taxes of the Transferred Companies for periods beginning on or after the
Closing Date.

  

### 

  

### (d) Seller will be entitled to retain, or receive prompt payment from
Buyer or any Transferred Company of, any refund or credit for overpayment of
Taxes for which Seller is responsible pursuant to Sections 9.1(a) or (b) plus
any interest received with respect thereto from the relevant Governmental
Authorities.  Buyer will, if Seller reasonably requests and at SellerÂ’s
expense, cause the Transferred Companies to promptly file for and obtain any
refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled under this Section 9.1(d).
Buyer will permit Seller to control (at SellerÂ’s expense) the prosecution of
any such claim for refund and, when deemed appropriate by Seller, will cause
the relevant entity to authorize, by appropriate power of attorney, such
person as Seller may designate to represent such entity with respect to such
refund claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that any action taken by Seller that

have the larger Tax liability at stake shall control any audit,
administrative or court proceeding relative to any Straddle Period with the
participation of the other party (or, if the party that would have the larger
Tax liability at stake cannot be determined, Buyer and Seller shall jointly
control such audit, administrative or court proceeding relative to any
Straddle Period), which control shall be exercised reasonably and in good
faith with due regard to the relative Tax liability potentially incurred by
either party.
