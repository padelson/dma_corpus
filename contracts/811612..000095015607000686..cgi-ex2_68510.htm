ARTICLE III  
--- 
    
  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT 
 CORPORATIONS; SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES  
    
  

 Section 3.1 _Conversion of Company Common Stock in the Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of any holder of any capital stock of Parent, Subsidiary or the Company:  
    
  

 (a) each previously-issued share of Company Common Stock that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares required to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Consideration, payable to the holder thereof, in each case without interest, upon surrender of the certificate formerly representing such share of the Company Common Stock and such other documents as reasonably may be required in accordance with Section 3.3, and all such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, no longer shall be outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Common Stock Consideration per share therefor, without interest, upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 3.3 or to perfect any rights of appraisal as a holder of Dissenting Shares that such holder may have pursuant to the MBCA, as well as the right to receive any unpaid dividend with respect to the Company Common Stock with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time and each holder of shares of Company Common Stock issued in uncertificated form similarly shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Common Stock Consideration per share therefor, without interest, upon compliance with the requirements of Section 3.3 or to perfect any rights of appraisal as a holder of Dissenting Shares that such holder may have pursuant to the MBCA, as well as the right to receive any unpaid dividend with respect to the Company Common Stock with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time; and  
    
  

 (b) each share of Company Common Stock of the Company, if any, owned of record or beneficially, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Subsidiary or held in treasury by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company (each a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity) automatically shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.  
    
  

 Section 3.2 _Conversion of Subsidiary Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent as the sole shareholder of Subsidiary, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of Subsidiary that is issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.50 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.  
    
  

 Section 3.3 _Surrender and Exchange of Certificates_.  
    
  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and from and after the Effective Time Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent cash in an amount equal to the aggregate amounts payable under Sections 3.1(a) and 3.5.  
    
  

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than five (5) business days after the date thereof, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock (each an " _Effective Date Holder_ ") whose shares were converted into  
    

<PAGE> 3

    

the right to receive the Common Stock Consideration pursuant to Section
3.1(a), (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form for transactions of this
nature (which shall specify that for holders of shares not issued in
uncertificated form, delivery of such holder\'s Company Certificates shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass,
only upon actual delivery of the Company Certificates to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent reasonably may
specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Company Certificates in exchange for the Common Stock Consideration and
instructions for use by holders of shares issued in uncertificated form. Upon
delivery to the Paying Agent of a duly executed letter of transmittal and such
other documents as the Paying Agent shall reasonably require, including where
applicable delivery of Company Certificates, each Effective Date Holder shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Common Stock Consideration for
each share of Company Common Stock covered by the letter of transmittal, in
accordance with Section 3.1(a), and the Company Certificates so surrendered
shall be canceled. If a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock has
occurred but has not been registered in the transfer records of the Company, a
check representing the proper amount of Common Stock Consideration may be
issued to the transferee if the Company Certificate representing such shares
of Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent accompanied by all
documents and endorsements required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as provided in this Section 3.3, each Company Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Common Stock Consideration for each share of
Company Common Stock represented thereby. No interest will be paid or accrue
on any amounts payable upon surrender of any Company Certificate.

 (c) Promptly following the date that is twelve months after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to Parent all cash and any documents in its possession or control relating to the transactions described in this Agreement, and the Paying Agent\'s duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Company Certificate may surrender such Company Certificate to the Surviving Corporation or Parent and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) receive in exchange therefor the Common Stock Consideration, payable upon due surrender of the Company Certificate without any interest thereon.  
    
  

 (d) If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the Common Stock Consideration deliverable in respect thereof determined in accordance with this Article III; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion, require the delivery of an indemnity or bond in customary amount against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Certificate or ownership thereof.

previously entitled thereto.

 Section 3.4 _Closing of the Company\'s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, holders of Company Certificates shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company, and the Company Share Certificates shall represent solely the right to receive the Common Stock Consideration and, if applicable, any unpaid dividends, pursuant to Section 3.1, without interest. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Common Stock Consideration in accordance with this Article III.  
    
  

 Section 3.5 _Options; Restricted Stock Units_.  
    
  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each option, warrant or other similar right (other than Restricted Stock Units, which are addressed in paragraph (b) of this Section 3.5) to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (each an " _Option_ ") that then remains outstanding and originally was granted under any Company Plan (but not including options (" _ACIC Options_ ") issued under the American Commerce Agents Plan), whether or not then vested or exercisable, automatically shall be terminated at the Effective Time and converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive thereupon in full satisfaction of such Option as of the Effective Time, an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Common Stock Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such Option and (y) the number (determined without reference to vesting requirements or other limitations on exercisability) of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Option (the " _Option Consideration_ ").  
    
  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding restricted stock unit (whether vested or unvested) granted under any Company Plan (the " _Restricted Stock Units_ ") pursuant to the terms of a Restricted Stock Unit Agreement between the Company and a holder thereof (each, an " _RSU Agreement_ ") shall be terminated and converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Consideration payable with respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such unit (the " _RSU Consideration_ "). The cash payment in lieu of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Section 3.5(b), together with any Dividend Equivalent Payment (as defined in the RSU Agreement) that is owed as of the Effective Time, less any required withholding Taxes on such Dividend Equivalent Payment, shall be paid to each Participant (as defined in the RSU Agreement) (or, if applicable, the Participant\'s designated beneficiary or legal representative) in accordance with Section 3.5(e).  
    
  

 (c) The Options and the Restricted Stock Units are collectively referred to herein as the " _Equity Awards_." The aggregate Option Consideration and RSU Consideration payable pursuant to Sections 3.3(a) and 3.3(b) is referred to herein as the " _Equity Award Consideration._ " Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, as applicable, have adopted such resolutions and taken or caused to be taken all such other action, if any, as may be required to effectuate the treatment of Equity Awards provided for in this Section 3.5.  
    
  

 (d) At the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding ACIC Option automatically shall be converted into the right to acquire upon exercise (subject to satisfaction of all vesting and other conditions to exercise, which shall remain in full force and effect), an amount in cash for each share of Company  
    

<PAGE> 5

    

Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such exercise but for the conversion
provided for in this paragraph equal to the excess of (x) the Common Stock
Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share of such ACIC Option (the "
_Agent Option Payment_ "). Following the Effective Time, the Agent Option
Payment with respect to each ACIC Option referenced in the immediately
preceding sentence shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation to the
applicable person on the applicable Confirmation Date (as such term is defined
in the applicable Agent Option Agreement between the Company, or any of its
Subsidiaries, and the holder thereof), provided that all terms and conditions
of such Agent Option Agreement have then been satisfied. For the avoidance of
doubt, it is the intention of Parent and the Company that (i) any ACIC Option
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and has an
exercise price greater than the Merger Consideration shall expire without the
right to receive any Company Common Stock or any payment in lieu thereof and
(ii) no acceleration of the exercisability of any ACIC Option shall occur by
reason of the Merger.  
--- 
    
  

 (e) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of an Equity Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, a check in an amount equal to the Equity Award Consideration due and payable to such holder pursuant to Sections 3.5(a) and 3.5(b) in respect of such Equity Award.  
    
  

 Section 3.6 _Tax Withholding_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Options, Restricted Stock Units or ACIC Options such amounts as Parent or the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the shares of Company Common Stock, Options, Restricted Stock Units or ACIC Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.  
    
  

 Section 3.7 _Dissenting Shares_.  
    
  

 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any Dissenting Shares held by a Dissenting Shareholder shall not be converted into the Common Stock Consideration but shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Shareholder pursuant to the MBCA; _provided_ , _however_ , that each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a Dissenting Shareholder who, after the Effective Time, withdraws his demand or fails to perfect or otherwise loses his right of appraisal, pursuant to the MBCA, shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Common Stock Consideration, without interest.  
    
  

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal pursuant to the applicable provisions of the MBCA received by the Company, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the MBCA and received by the Company relating to rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the MBCA. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal, or settle, or offer to settle, or otherwise negotiate any such demands for appraisal.

Effect, (A) sell, divest, hold separate, or otherwise dispose of any of their
or of the Company\'s or any of the Company Subsidiaries\' respective
businesses, product lines or assets or (B) conduct their or the Company\'s or

 Section 6.3 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Meeting of Shareholders_.  
    
  

 (a) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, prepare and file a preliminary form of the Proxy Statement with the SEC and each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff, and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company\'s shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after responding to all such comments to the satisfaction of the SEC\'s staff. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. If at any time prior to the Shareholders Meeting there shall occur any event that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare, and, after consultation with Parent, mail to its shareholders such an amendment or supplement. Parent shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto and shall furnish the Company with all information reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in, or otherwise in respect of, the Proxy Statement. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Proxy Statement and the related proxy materials and any proposed amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement prior to its filing with the SEC or dissemination to the Company\'s shareholders. The Company shall not use any proxy material (including, without limitation, the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto) in connection with the Shareholders Meeting without the prior approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.  
    
  

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties shall correct promptly any information provided by it to be used specifically in the Proxy Statement, if and to the extent any such information shall be or have become false or misleading in any material respect and shall take all steps necessary to file with the SEC and have declared effective or cleared by the SEC any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so as to correct the same and to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected to be disseminated to the Company\'s shareholders, in each case to the extent required by applicable law or otherwise deemed appropriate by the Company.  
    
  

 (c) The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and its articles of organization and by-laws, as promptly as reasonably practicable, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholders\' Approval. Subject to the fiduciary duties of the Company\'s Board of Directors under applicable law, the Company shall include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of its Board of Directors that the Company Shareholders\' approval be given (the " _Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may (and shall, if so reasonably requested by Parent) adjourn or postpone the Shareholders Meeting to such future date as the Company may reasonably determine, if (x) as of the time for which the Shareholders Meeting is then scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary  
   

 

<PAGE> 31

 

   

to conduct the business of such Shareholders Meeting or (y) the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
applicable Law or fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors require the
Company to supplement or amend the Proxy Statement in advance of a vote on
such approval.  
--- 
    
  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in clause (c) of this Section 6.3, at any time before the approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Recommendation may be withdrawn or modified if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after receiving the advice of the Company\'s outside legal counsel, that the failure to withdraw or modify such recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the Company\'s Board of Directors.  
    
  

 Section 6.4 _Public Statements_. Unless otherwise required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of the New York Stock Exchange or any other securities exchange (the " _Exchange Rules_ "), the Company will not cause and will use its reasonable best efforts not to permit any public announcement with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. The initial press release with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall require the prior mutual agreement and approval of both Parent and the Company and any subsequent press releases or other public statements (unless required by applicable law or the Exchange Rules) with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be made by or on behalf of the Company, only following prior consultation with and approved by Parent.  
    
  

 Section 6.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such employees of their normal duties. Except as required by law, Parent and Subsidiary shall hold, and shall cause the Parent Representatives to hold, in strict confidence all nonpublic documents and confidential information furnished to Parent, Subsidiary and any Parent Representative in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the confidentiality agreement dated as of August 22, 2007 between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement"_ ).  
    
  

 Section 6.6 _Acquisition Proposals_.  
    
  

 (a) The Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents to, immediately cease any activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, and require the return or destruction of all confidential information regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries provided to any such persons on or prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to

the terms of any confidentiality agreement or otherwise to the extent provided
by any such confidentiality agreement, in each case subject to any restriction
or other limitation set forth in any such confidentiality agreement. None of
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, consultants, agents, advisors and other representatives
(collectively, the " _Company Representatives_ ") shall, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, participate, solicit or encourage (including by way
of providing information), or take any other action designed or reasonably
likely to facilitate or encourage, any inquiries, proposals or offers that
constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal
or engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto or otherwise
cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries,
proposals, discussions or negotiations, or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any
merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase
agreement, asset purchase agreement or share exchange agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement providing for or relating to an
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement or agreement in principle
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or breach its obligations
hereunder or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.6(a), until the Company Shareholders\' Approval is obtained, if the Company has received from a third party an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that the Company\'s Board of Directors determines in good faith constitutes or reasonably could be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below), then the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making the Acquisition Proposal (pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such person, in the aggregate, than the Confidentiality Agreement) and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with such person regarding the Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary that is provided to any person pursuant to this Section 6.6(b) and was not previously provided to Parent. (For purposes of this Section 6.6(b), material non-public information will be deemed to have been provided to Parent if it has been posted on the data site utilized by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at a time when Parent and its advisers continue to have substantially the same access to such data site as during the negotiation of this Agreement and receive notice of the additions to the data site.)  
    
  

 (c) The Company shall immediately advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for information or of any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request or Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however_ , that the identity of the person making such request or Acquisition Proposal need not be provided until such time as it provides the Parent Notice (as defined below). The Company will immediately inform Parent of any material change in the details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or Acquisition Proposal. The Company will promptly provide Parent with any documents received from any such person and promptly provide Parent such information as it may reasonably request.  
    
  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholders\' Approval, the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which the Company\'s Board of Directors determines in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company\'s Board of Directors may terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.6(d) and any purported termination pursuant to this Section 6.6(d) shall be void, unless concurrently with such termination the Company pays the Termination Fee (as defined below) payable  
   

 

<PAGE> 33

 

   

pursuant to Section 8.2(b); and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Board of
Directors may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.6(d)
unless the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent (the "
_Parent Notice_ "), at least four business days in advance (the " _Notice
Period_ "), of its intention to terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice
shall specify the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the party making the Superior Proposal), and shall
be accompanied by a copy of a draft of the definitive agreement proposed to be
entered into with respect to the Superior Proposal (it being understood that
in the event that any material revisions (or revisions that in the aggregate
are material) are made to the initial Superior Proposal, the Company shall
deliver to Parent within one business day written notice of any such material
revisions (including a detailed description thereof) and a new Notice Period
shall be deemed to have commenced with respect to such modified Superior
Proposal on the date of delivery of such notice to Parent). The Company\'s
Board of Directors shall direct the Company Representatives to negotiate in
good faith with Parent and its representatives regarding any proposal Parent
may make following any such notice of a Superior Proposal.  
--- 
    
  

 (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company\'s Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company\'s shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any other disclosure to the Company\'s shareholders if, in the case of any disclosure described in this clause (ii), the Company\'s Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such disclosure is required under applicable Law.  
    
  

 (f) For purposes of this Agreement:  
    
  

 " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal, offer or expression of interest by any third party (i) for a merger, consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other business combination involving the Company, (ii) for the issuance of 20% or more of the equity securities of the Company as consideration for the assets or securities of another person or (iii) to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the equity securities of the Company or assets (including equity securities of any Company Subsidiary) that represent 20% or more of the assets of the Company, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by or expressly permitted under this Agreement.  
    
  

 " _Superior Proposal_ " means any Acquisition Proposal (but replacing references to "20% or more" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal with "all or substantially all") on terms that the Company\'s Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with the Company\'s financial advisor to be superior from a financial point of view to the Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement, and including in each case the risks and probabilities of consummation).  
    
  

 Section 6.7 _Expenses and Fees_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses.

 (a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and related rights to advancement of expenses on the part of each person who at the Effective Time is a current or former director or officer of the Company, including all such rights existing pursuant to the MBCA, the Company\'s articles of organization or bylaws or any written agreement between any such person and the Company in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect until 180   
   

 

<PAGE> 

 

   

days after the expiration of the longest applicable statute of limitation;
_provided, however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such claim. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
comply with its obligations with respect to such rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses.  
--- 
    
  

 (b) Parent agrees that, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than six years from the Effective Time the insurance coverage provided under the policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company at the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , __ that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies issued by reputable and financially sound carriers that provide at least the same coverage, on terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to such persons but only if such substitution does not result in any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for such coverage in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement; and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 6.8, it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to such maximum amount. Parent\'s obligations under this paragraph may be satisfied by the purchase of a "tail" insurance policy that provides the coverage described above.  
    
  

 (c) If the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.  
    
  

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. Parent hereby guarantees the performance of the Surviving Corporation\'s obligations under this Section 6.8.  
    
  

 Section 6.9 _Employee Benefits_.  
    
  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, following the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, and cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, each Company Plan and the related funding arrangements of such Company Plan in accordance with its terms. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall honor, and cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, all rights to vacation, personal and sick days accrued by employees of the Company and its subsidiaries under any plans, policies, programs and arrangements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries through and including the Effective Time. Nothing herein shall prohibit any changes to any Company Plan that are (i) required by law (including any applicable qualification requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code); or (ii) necessary as a technical matter to reflect the transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing herein shall require Parent to continue any particular Company Plan or any particular practice or course of conduct with respect to any Company Plan or prevent the amendment or termination of any plan or benefits (subject to the obligation to provide severance pay and benefits as provided above).  
    
  

 (b) With respect to any employee benefit plans in which any employees of the Company or its subsidiaries first become eligible to participate, on or after the Effective Time, and in which the Company employees did not participate prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under any such new plans in   
   

 

<PAGE> 35

 

   

which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting
periods would apply under the analogous Company Plan; (ii) provide each
employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent
such credit was given under the analogous Company Plan prior to the Effective
Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
under any such new plan in which such employees may be eligible to participate
after the Effective Time; (iii) recognize all service of such employees for
all purposes (including, without limitation, purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting) in any such new plan in which such employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time; and (iv) with respect to
flexible spending accounts, provide each employee of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries with a credit for any salary reduction contributions made
thereto and a debit for any expenses incurred thereunder with respect to the
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs; _provided_ , that the foregoing
shall not apply to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits.  
--- 
    
  

 (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company will cause the governing documents of The Commerce Group, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the " _Plan_ ") to be amended in accordance with its terms and applicable law so that as of the Closing the portion of the Plan intended to qualify as an employee stock ownership plan within the meaning of Section 4975(e) of the Code (the " _ESOP_ ") is terminated, such amendments to be subject to Parent\'s review and approval. The Company will submit the Plan as so amended to the IRS in order to obtain a favorable determination letter as to the Plan\'s tax-qualified status following such amendment.  
    
  

 (d) The Company will amend, within the applicable remedial amendment period, any Company Plan in order to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to the extent applicable and the guidance with respect thereto issued by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, provided however, that nothing in this Section 6.9(d) shall require the Company to amend a Company Plan terminated prior the end of such remedial amendment period in accordance with such requirements and guidance.  
    
  

 (e) For the avoidance of doubt, Parent covenants that at all relevant times at and after the Effective Time no RSU Agreement Participant (as defined by the RSU Agreement) shall be a "covered employee" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, and no distribution in respect to any RSU Agreement shall be deferred by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or otherwise pursuant to Section 4(c) of any RSU Agreement.

--- 
    
  

 Section 6.12 _Commitment_. Parent shall provide the Company written notice within 48 hours of such time as the Commitment is withdrawn or terminated, or amended or supplemented in any respect, or if any event occurs which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Subsidiary under any term or condition of the Commitment, or that reasonably could be expected to result in any of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the lender and its affiliates under the Commitment not being satisfied.

 Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.  
    
  

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.1, this Agreement forthwith shall become void and there shall be no liability or further obligation under or in respect of this Agreement on the part of the Company, Parent, Subsidiary or their respective officers or directors, other than in respect of Section 6.7, this Section 8.2 and Article IX, all of which shall survive and except that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability or damages resulting from (i) knowing, intentional misrepresentation or fraud or (ii) a willful material breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement.  
    
  

 (b) The Company agrees that a fee (a " _Termination Fee"_ ) shall be payable under certain circumstances following a termination of this Agreement, as follows:  
    
  

 (i) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i) or Section 8.1(d)(ii), the Termination Fee shall be payable immediately upon such termination, and  
    
  

 (ii) if (A) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(iii), (B) after the date of this Agreement and before the termination described in clause (A), an Acquisition Proposal by a third party has been publicly disclosed or announced and not withdrawn (x) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii), at least 10 days before the Shareholders Meeting or (y) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(iii), before the applicable breach by the Company, and (C) in either of the cases referred to in this clause (ii), within one year after the termination the Company shall consummate a transaction or enter into a definitive agreement or agreement in principle for a transaction with any third party that involves the consummation of a transaction described in the definition of Acquisition Proposal (but replacing references to "20% or more" with "50% or more") (an " _Alternative Transaction_ "), then in either of the cases referred to in this clause (ii), upon consummation of the Alternative Transaction, the Company shall pay the Termination Fee.  
   

 

<PAGE> 40

--- 
    
  

 (d) The Termination Fee shall be paid as directed by Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds promptly, but in no event later than two business days, after it first becomes due.  
    
  

 (e) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) in a situation described in clause (B) of Section 8.2(b)(ii), but the Termination Fee (or any portion thereof) has not been paid and is not payable because the circumstances referred to in clause (C) of Section 8.2(b)(ii) shall not have occurred, the Company shall pay at the direction of Parent as promptly as practicable (but in any event within two business days after receipt of Parent\'s request therefor), an amount on account of the expenses incurred by Parent and its affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in the amount of $7.5 million (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ ").  
    
  

 (f) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2 when it is required to be paid, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees) in connection with such suit, including any costs of collection, together with interest on the amount of the amount determined to be owed at the rate of 8.0% per annum from the date such fee was required to be paid.
