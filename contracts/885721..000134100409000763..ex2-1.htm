other governmental inquiries or investigations or internal investigations
pending or threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of

Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.4 Authorization; No Conflicts. (a) Purchaser has the
requisite corporate power and authority, as applicable, and has taken all
corporate action necessary to execute and deliver this Agreement and each
Other Transaction Document to which it is, or shall become a party, to

transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly authorized and
approved by the Board of Directors of Purchaser, and no other corporate

delivery and performance of this Agreement and each Other Transaction
Document by Purchaser and the consummation of the transactions contemplated

be executed and delivered by Purchaser have been or will be duly executed
and delivered by Purchaser and, assuming that this Agreement and each of the

Seller when executed and delivered by Seller, constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Purchaser enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with
their terms, except to the extent that their enforceability may be subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and by
general equitable principles.

 

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and each Other Transaction
Document to be executed and delivered by Purchaser as contemplated hereby do
not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and by the Other Transaction Documents will not: (i) conflict with any of the
provisions of the certificate or articles of incorporation or by-laws or
other equivalent charter documents, as applicable, of Purchaser;
(ii) conflict with, result in a breach of or default under (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) any (A) Permit of Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries or (B) Contract to which Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their assets are bound or subject;
or (iii) subject to the receipt or making of the consents,
approvals, authorizations and filings referred to in Section 4.5, contravene
any Law or Order currently in effect, except in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii) above, for such conflicts, breaches, defaults or contraventions which

aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect or (y) impair or delay
Purchaser\'s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Other Transaction Documents.

Antitrust Laws are made and any waiting periods thereunder have been
terminated or expired, no other consent, approval, authorization or filing of
or with any Governmental Entity, which has not been received or made, is
necessary or required by or with respect to Purchaser in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser and each
Other Transaction

Document to which it is or may become a party or the consummation by
Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the Other

Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 4.6 Absence of Certain Changes. Since the Balance Sheet Date and
to the date of this Agreement the businesses of Purchaser and Purchaser\'s
Subsidiaries have been conducted in all material respects in the ordinary
course. Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any change in the
results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise), assets or business
of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which both (i) has had,
or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) would have a material adverse

(b) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall be responsible for the payment of
fifty percent (50%) of all filing fees under the HSR Act. Each Party shall be
responsible for the

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment of its and its Affiliates\' expenses, including reasonable legal fees
and expenses, in complying with any request for additional information
or documentary material from any Antitrust Authority or otherwise complying
with this Section 5.5, including Sections 5.5(d) and 5.5(e).

 

 

(c) Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, acquire or
agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or
by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association
or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement
relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation
would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay in
the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any
consents of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity
entering an Order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; (iii) materially increase the risk of not being able to
remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) materially delay
or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

(d) Subject to Section 5.5(f), Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall take any
and all of the following actions requested by any Antitrust Authority, or
necessary to resolve any objections that may be asserted by any Antitrust
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under any Antitrust Law:

 

 

(i)   at Purchaser\'s sole cost, comply with all restrictions and
conditions, if any, imposed or requested by any Antitrust Authority with
respect to Antitrust Laws in connection with granting any necessary clearance
or terminating any applicable waiting period including (x) agreeing to sell,
divest, hold separate, license, cause a third party to acquire, or otherwise
dispose of, any Subsidiary, operations, divisions, businesses, product lines,
customers or assets of any Target Company contemporaneously with or after the
Closing (a "Divestiture"), (y) taking or committing to take such other
actions that may limit Purchaser\'s, its Affiliates\' or any Target
Company\'s freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one
or more of any Target Company\'s operations, divisions, businesses, products
lines, customers or assets, and (z) entering into any Order, consent decree
or other agreement to effectuate any of the foregoing;

 

 

(ii)   agree to terminate any Contract or other business relationship of any
Target Company as may be required to obtain any necessary clearance of any
Antitrust Authority or to obtain termination of any applicable waiting period
under any Antitrust Laws; and

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

(iii) oppose fully and vigorously any request for, the entry of, and seek to
have vacated or terminated, any Order or ruling of any Antitrust Authority
that could restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including by defending
through litigation, any action asserted by any Person in any court or before
any Antitrust Authority and by exhausting all avenues of appeal, including
appealing properly any adverse decision or Order by any Antitrust
Authority; provided, that, subject to Section 5.5(g), Seller and each of its
Subsidiaries shall also be obligated, at the direction of, and consultation
with, Purchaser, to take each of the actions set forth in this clause (iii).

 

 

(e) Subject to Section 5.5(g), Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, agree, if, but solely if requested by Purchaser, to take any of the
actions set forth in Sections 5.5(d)(i) and 5.5(d)(ii) with respect to the
business, assets and operations of the Target Companies; provided, that
neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to agree to (1)
any such action which is not conditioned upon the Closing or (2) any term
requiring post-Closing indemnification of a third party by Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries (except arising out of actions taken by Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries). Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any
liability or obligation with respect to, and shall be indemnified and
held harmless by Purchaser from, against and in respect of any Losses
suffered, paid or incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates as a result of,
in connection with or otherwise caused by, Seller\'s compliance with
Sections 5.5(d)(i) or 5.5(d)(ii), including any claims for breach of contract
or violation of any Order entered into pursuant to such Sections, but, in
each case, only insofar as it relates to liabilities, obligations or Losses
arising (i) prior to the earlier of (x) the Closing or (y) the later of
termination of this Agreement or the agreement in question (without giving
effect to any amendment thereof entered into without Purchaser\'s consent)
and (ii) other than under this Agreement.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser
shall not be required to propose, negotiate, commit to, take or enter into
(1) any of the actions set forth in Section 5.5(d), nor offer to take or
offer to commit to take any such action which (i) is not conditioned upon the
Closing and/or (ii) Purchaser determines in good faith (A) would, or
would reasonably be expected to, materially and adversely affect the Target
Companies, taken as a whole or (B) would, or would reasonably be expected to,
materially impair the benefits sought to be derived by Purchaser from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account, among other
things, effects on the assets, business and operations and relationships of
both Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (other than the Target Companies) and of
the Target Companies and their Subsidiaries), (2) any action requested by
any Antitrust Authority, or necessary to resolve any objections that may be
asserted by any Antitrust Authority which involves any Subsidiary,
operations, divisions, businesses, product lines, customers or assets of
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Target Companies after
the Closing (subject to clause (1) of

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Section 5.5(f))), including agreeing to sell, divest, hold separate,
license, cause a third party to acquire, or otherwise dispose of any such
Subsidiary, operations, divisions, businesses, product lines, customers or
assets, or any other actions that may limit Purchaser\'s or any of its
Subsidiaries\' (other than the Target Companies after Closing (subject to
clause (1) of this Section 5.5(f))) freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, any of its Subsidiaries, operations, divisions,
businesses, product lines, customers or assets or (3) any action (either by
itself or through any of its Subsidiaries (including the Target Companies
following the Closing)) in connection with the Other Insurance Approvals or
the Ohio State Insurance Approval that could reasonably be expected to have
an adverse effect on Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Target Companies following the Closing).

 

 

(g) Subject to Section 5.5(h), nothing contained in this Section 5.5 or in
any other provision of this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries to agree to any terms or conditions as a
condition to, or in connection with, obtaining any necessary consent or
approval of any Antitrust Authority or other Governmental Entity or to obtain
termination of any applicable waiting period under any Antitrust Laws that
would (i) impose any limitations on Seller\'s ownership or operation of all
or any portion of its or any of its Subsidiaries\' (other than the
Target Companies), businesses or assets, or compel Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Target Companies after the Closing) to sell,
divest, hold separate, license, cause a third party to acquire or otherwise
dispose of all or any portion of its or any of its Subsidiaries\' (other than
the Target Companies), businesses or assets, (ii) impose any obligations on
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Target Companies after
the Closing) in respect of or relating to Seller\'s or any of its
Subsidiaries\' (other than the Target Companies) facilities, operations,
places of business, employment levels, products or businesses, (iii) require
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Target Companies after the
Closing) to make any payments or (iv) impose any other obligation,
restriction, limitation, qualification or other condition (including any
requirement to terminate any Contract or other business relationship) on
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Target Companies) (any such
term or condition in (i) through (iv) being referred to herein as a
"Burdensome Term or Condition").

 

 

(h) Subject to the proviso below, Seller shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries (including the Target Companies prior to the Closing) to, take
any and all actions, and do all things necessary, proper or advisable
(including, with the prior consent of Purchaser (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), re-allocating a portion of the consideration to be
paid in accordance with Section 2.3 to the LLC Interest) to obtain the
approval of, or consent to, the transactions contemplated hereby, by or from
the Ohio State Department of Insurance under any applicable state insurance
or similar Laws (the "Ohio State Insurance Approval"); provided, however,
that no such actions shall be taken that could reasonably be expected to have
an adverse effect on Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Target Companies following the Closing).

 

 

Section 5.6 Employee Matters. (a) (i) Within a reasonable period of time
(but not less than seven (7) calendar days) prior to the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall make an offer of employment to each current employee of Seller
or its Affiliates (other than those employees set forth on Schedule 5.6(a)
of the Seller Disclosure Letter that Seller will provide to Purchaser not
less than thirty (30) calendar days following the execution of this
Agreement, which Schedule shall be subject to the mutual agreement of
Purchaser and Seller as set forth below) who

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

performs services primarily for the Target Companies commencing as of the
Closing Date in the same job function and location as in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date, and on the terms and conditions set forth below,
and (ii) upon the Closing Date, Purchaser will continue to employ, at will
(unless otherwise specified by contract), all persons who, as of the Closing
Date, are employees of the Target Companies, including employees not actively
at work due to injury, vacation, military duty, disability or other leave of
absence, in each case as of the Closing Date (the employees listed in (i) and
(ii) above, collectively, the "Company Employees"). For at least one (1)
year following the Closing Date, and assuming continued employment during
such period, Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided to the Company
Employees during their continued employment (i) the same salary or wage level
and (ii) benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser; provided,
however, that the aggregate of the base pay, incentive opportunity and
benefits provided by Purchaser to each Company Employee during such one (1)
year period (or such shorter period during which such Company Employee
remains employed) shall not be less than 70% of the aggregate of the base
pay, incentive opportunity and benefits provided to such Company Employee by
Seller or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date. Nothing in
this Agreement shall require Purchaser to retain any Company Employee for any
period of time after the Closing Date and, subject to the requirements of
applicable law, Purchaser reserves the right, at any time after the Closing
Date, to terminate such employment and, except as expressly stated in this
Agreement, to amend, modify or terminate any term or condition of employment
including, without limitation, any employee benefit plan, program, policy,
practice or arrangement or the compensation or working conditions of
the Company Employees. Purchaser shall provide Seller with written notice of
Purchaser\'s objections, if any, to the employees included on Schedule 5.6(a)
of the Seller Disclosure Letter within fifteen (15) calendar days after
delivery of such Schedule, after which Seller and Purchaser agree to work
together, in good faith, to reach a mutually agreeable list of employees
included on Schedule 5.6(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 

 

(b) Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to (i) assume the liabilities, obligations and responsibilities
to, or in respect of, each Company Employee set forth on Schedule 5.6(b) of
the Seller Disclosure Letter arising under the terms of the
WellPoint Executive Agreement Plan, in accordance with the terms thereof in
effect on the Closing Date; and (ii) assume, honor and be solely responsible
for paying, providing or satisfying when due all vacation, sick pay and other
paid time off for Company Employees accrued but unused as of the Closing
Date, on terms and conditions not less favorable than the terms and
conditions in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) Purchaser shall
keep or cause to keep in effect for at least one (1) year following
the Closing Date severance and retention plans, practices and policies
applicable to Company Employees on the date hereof that are not less
favorable than (A) the benefits set forth on Schedule 5.6(c) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter or (B) such plans, practices and policies that may be
provided to such Company Employees under the terms of a severance plan of
Purchaser or its Affiliates, whichever is more favorable to such
Company Employees on the date of termination of employment; provided,

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

62  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

however that if the benefits referenced in clause (A) shall be more favorable
than those referenced in clause (B), Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for the
incremental liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by Purchaser in excess
of $8,000,000 in connection with providing benefits under clause (A) over the
liabilities, costs and expenses that would have been incurred by Purchaser in
connection with providing benefits under clause (B), up to a maximum
aggregate contribution by Seller of $8,000,000, such reimbursement to occur
from time to time promptly after receipt by Seller from Purchaser of
reasonably detailed invoices relating thereto, and (ii) all Company Employees
who were notified of their target bonuses for the current fiscal year shall
(A) to the extent a Company Employee remains employed by Purchasers or its
Affiliates through the end of 2009, such Company Employee shall receive a
pro-rata portion of their unpaid quarterly and/or annual bonuses, as
applicable, determined based on the number of days in such quarterly or
annual period, as applicable, that have elapsed prior to the Closing
Date divided by the total number of days in the applicable period, such bonus
to be paid by Seller and (B) be eligible to participate in the applicable
bonus plan of Purchaser with a target bonus opportunity no less favorable
than the target bonus opportunity to which they were entitled immediately
prior to the Closing Date, with payment based on actual performance and pro
rated based on the number of days remaining in the applicable quarterly or
annual period after the Closing Date divided by the total number of days in
such period. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from any
Losses arising out of or related to the bonus obligations of Purchaser under
Section 5.6(c)(ii)(A).

 

 

(d) Each Company Employee who is a participant in the WellPoint 401(k)
Retirement Savings Plan (the "Seller Savings Plan") shall cease to be an
active participant under such plan effective as of the Closing Date. Seller
shall cause each such Company Employee to become fully vested in any employer
contributions under such plan. Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall have in effect or cause its Affiliate to have in effect a
defined contribution plan for the benefit of the Company Employees that is
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and that includes a qualified cash
or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the
"Purchaser Savings Plan"). As soon as practicable following the Closing
Date, the Seller Savings Plan shall transfer to the Purchaser Savings Plan,
and Purchaser agrees to cause the Purchaser Savings Plan to accept, the
account balance (in the form of cash and promissory notes evidencing
all outstanding loans and subject to any qualified domestic relations
orders pursuant to Section 414(p) of the Code) of each employee of the Target
Companies under the Seller Savings Plan as of the valuation date next
preceding the date of transfer. Such transfer shall be subject to Seller\'s
receipt of a current determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
indicating that the Purchaser Savings Plan is qualified under Sections 401(a)
and 401(k) of the Code and Purchaser\'s receipt of a consent determination
letter from the Internal Revenue Service indicating that the Seller Savings
Plan is qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code. Following
such transfer, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall assume all liabilities of
Seller and its Affiliates under the Seller Savings Plan to provide benefits
to or on behalf of the employees of the Target Companies to the extent of the
account balances so transferred, and neither the Seller Savings Plan nor
Seller or its Affiliates shall have any obligation to Purchaser or any
Affiliate of Purchaser or with respect to any employee of the Target
Companies with respect thereto.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

(e) Effective as of the Closing Date, if Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
have in effect non-qualified retirement plans ("Purchaser NQ Plans"),
Company Employees who meet the eligibility requirements of Purchaser NQ Plans
shall be offered the opportunity to participate in the Purchaser NQ Plans.
For purposes of determining eligibility to participate in Purchaser NQ Plans,
Purchaser shall treat compensation paid to the Company Employees while
employed by Seller as compensation paid by Purchaser or its Affiliates.

 

 

(f) Following the Closing Date, (i) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, waive, or cause its health plan, dental plan, and disability
plan insurance carriers to waive, all limitations or exclusions as to pre-
existing conditions, evidence of insurability or good health, waiting periods
or actively-at-work exclusions or other limitations or restrictions on
coverage, if any, applicable to any Company Employees or their eligible
spouses or dependents or beneficiaries under any welfare benefit plans in
which such employees may be eligible to participate; provided that with
respect to any particular Company Employee or their eligible spouse or
dependents, such waiver shall only apply to the extent such restrictions did
not apply to such Company Employee (or their eligible spouse or dependents)
on the Closing Date and (ii) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, credit all costs or expenses incurred by Company Employees (and their
eligible spouses or dependents) under the Benefit Plans prior to the Closing
Date, if any, for the year in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of
satisfying applicable deductible, co-payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of-
pocket provisions and like adjustments or limitations on coverage under any
such welfare benefit plans. Seller shall retain responsibility under its
medical, dental, vision and life insurance plans for all amounts payable by
reason of claims incurred by Company Employees and their eligible spouses and
dependents prior to the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall be responsible
under its employee welfare benefit plans for all amounts payable by reason of
claims incurred by Company Employees by such employees and their eligible
spouses and dependents on or after the Closing Date. For these purposes, a
claim shall be deemed to be incurred: (i) in the case of medical,
prescription drug, dental or vision benefits, at the time professional
services, equipment or prescription drugs covered by the applicable plan are
obtained; (ii) in the case of life insurance benefits, upon death; and (iii)
in the case of accidental death and dismemberment benefits, at the time of
the accident.

 

 

(g) Purchaser shall have in effect, or cause to be in effect, as of the
Closing Date, flexible spending reimbursement accounts under a cafeteria plan
qualifying under Section 125 of the Code (the "Purchaser Cafeteria Plan")
that provides benefits to employees of the Target Companies substantially
identical in all material respects to those provided by the flexible spending
reimbursement accounts under the cafeteria plans in which such employees are
eligible to participate as of the date hereof (the "Seller Cafeteria
Plan"). As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall cause
to be transferred to Purchaser or its Affiliate an amount in cash equal to
the excess of the aggregate accumulated contributions to the flexible
spending reimbursement accounts under the Seller Cafeteria Plan made prior to
the Closing Date and during the year in which the Closing Date occurs by the
employees of the Target Companies over the aggregate reimbursement payouts
made prior to the Closing Date and for such year from such accounts to such
employees; provided, however, that, if the aggregate payouts from the
flexible spending reimbursement accounts made prior to the Closing Date and
during the year in

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the Closing Date occurs to employees of the Target Companies exceed
the aggregate accumulated contributions to such accounts prior to the Closing
Date and for such year by such employees, Purchaser shall cause such excess
to be transferred to Seller as soon as practicable following the Closing
Date. Purchaser shall cause such amounts to be credited to each such
employee\'s corresponding accounts under the Purchaser Cafeteria Plan in
which such employees participate following the Closing Date. On and after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume and be solely responsible for all claims
for reimbursement by Company Employees, whether incurred prior to, on or
after the Closing Date, that have not been paid in full as of the Closing
Date, which claims shall be paid pursuant to and under the terms of the
Purchaser Cafeteria Plan, and Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its Affiliates from any and all claims by or with respect to
Company Employees for reimbursement under the Seller Cafeteria Plan that have
not been paid in full as of the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees to cause the
Purchaser Cafeteria Plan to honor and continue through the end of the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs the elections made by each
Company Employee under the Seller Cafeteria Plan in respect of the flexible
spending reimbursement accounts that are in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall have
no obligation to honor Company Employees\' claims for reimbursement unless
and until the transfer of assets contemplated by this Section 5.6(g) occurs.
On the date of the transfer of assets contemplated by this Section 5.6(g),
Seller shall provide Purchaser or its Affiliate with copies of all unpaid
reimbursement requests made by Company Employee and, thereafter, Seller shall
provide to Purchaser or its Affiliate such necessary records as Purchaser or
its Affiliate may reasonably request relating to its obligations under this
Section 5.6(g).

 

 

(h) Periods of employment with Seller or the Target Companies (including any
current or former Affiliate of Seller or the Target Companies or any
predecessor of Seller or the Target Companies) shall be taken into account
for purposes of determining, as applicable, the eligibility
for participation, vesting and the calculation of benefits (other than with
respect to (i) the 2009 annual bonus calculated by Purchaser, and (ii)
defined benefit plans or supplemental defined benefit plans that, in either
case, is not a cash balance plan) of any Company Employee under all
employee benefit plans, policies or practices to which Purchaser or its
Affiliates contributes (or has an obligation to contribute) or is a party for
Company Employees, including vacation plans and arrangements, 401(k) and
other retirement plans, paid time off plans, and any severance and welfare
plans.

 

 

(i) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not at any time prior to ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as
those terms are defined in the WARN Act or effectuate any similar triggering
event under any other applicable Law, affecting in whole or in part any site
of employment, facility, operating unit or Company Employee. Purchaser agrees
to provide any required notice under the WARN Act and any other similar
applicable Law and to otherwise comply with any such statute with respect to
any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or
any similar triggering event under any other applicable Law occurring on or
after the Closing or arising as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from any Losses
arising out of or related to the obligations of Purchaser under this Section
5.6(i).

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

(j) Nothing contained herein, express or implied (i) shall be construed to
establish, amend or modify any Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement of Purchaser, (ii) is intended to confer or
shall confer upon any Company Employee any right to employment or continued
employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right
to a particular term of employment, (iii) is intended to confer or shall
confer upon any individual or any legal representative of any individual
(including employees, retirees, or dependents or beneficiaries of employees
or retirees and including collective bargaining agents or representatives)
any right as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, or (iv) shall be
deemed to confer upon any such individual or legal representative any rights
under or with respect to any plan, program or arrangement described in or
contemplated by this Agreement, and each such individual or legal
representative shall be entitled to look only to the express terms of any
such plans, program or arrangement for his or her rights thereunder.

 

 

(k) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent Seller provides Purchaser
with human resource related transition services described in Annex-II of the
Transition Services Agreement, references in Sections 5.6(f) and 5.6(g) to
the Closing Date shall be deemed to refer, instead, to the date
such transition services end.

 

 

Section 5.7 Directors and Officers. (a) For six (6) years after
the Closing the Target Companies shall, and Purchaser shall cause the Target
Companies to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of
reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket expenses to, any individual who, at or
prior to the Closing Date, was a director, officer, employee or agent of any
Target Company or who, at the request of any Target Company, served as a
director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise (collectively, with such individual\'s heirs, executors or
administrators, the "Indemnified Persons"), in each case to the same extent
such Persons are indemnified and have the right to advancement of reasonable,
documented, out-of-pocket expenses as of the date hereof by a Target Company
pursuant to such Target Company\'s certificate of incorporation, by-laws (or
similar governing documents) and indemnification agreements listed on
Schedule 5.7(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter and in existence on the date
hereof with any current or former directors or officers of the Target
Companies (but in any event to the fullest extent permitted by Law) for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
Other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby) (provided that the rights conferred by this
Section 5.7 shall not apply to any Action brought by or on behalf of Seller
or any of its Affiliates against any individual who, at or prior to the
Closing Date, was a director or officer of any Target Company) and (ii)
purchase as of the Closing a tail policy to the current policy of directors\'
and officers\' liability insurance maintained by Seller, which tail policy
shall be effective for a period from the Closing through and including the
date six (6) years after the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing Date against each
present or former director and officer of any Target Company who was, as of
the Closing Date covered by any Seller\'s officers\' and directors\'
liability insurance, and which tail policy shall contain substantially the
same coverage and amounts as, and contain terms and conditions no less
advantageous than, in the aggregate, the coverage currently provided by such
current policy;

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided, however, that in no event shall the Target Companies be required to
expend, for the entire tail policy, in excess of $2,000,000; and, provided,
further, that, if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount,
the Target Companies after consultation with Seller shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount.

 

 

(b) Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification under Section
5.7(a), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify Purchaser and the Target Companies
thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Purchaser and the
Target Companies of any liability they may have to such Indemnified Person if
such failure does not actually and materially prejudice the
indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation (whether based on facts, events or circumstances occurring
before or after the Closing), (i) Purchaser or the Target Companies shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof and neither Purchaser nor the
Target Companies shall be liable to such Indemnified Persons for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expense subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Persons in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
Purchaser or the Target Companies elect not to assume such defense or counsel
or the Indemnified Persons advise that there are issues that raise conflicts
of interest between Purchaser or the Target Companies and the Indemnified
Persons, the Indemnified Persons may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and
Purchaser shall and shall cause the Target Companies to pay all reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Persons promptly as
statements therefor are received; provided, however, the Target Companies
shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 5.7(b) to pay for only one firm
of counsel for all Indemnified Persons in any jurisdiction, (ii) the
Indemnified Persons will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and
(iii) neither Purchaser nor the Target Companies shall be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent; and provided, further,
that neither Purchaser nor the Target Companies shall have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Person if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall
have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Person in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, other than as set forth
in Section 5.7(b) above, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation (whether based on facts, events or circumstances occurring
before, at or after the Closing) is made against any Indemnified Persons on
or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing, the provisions of
this Section 5.7 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 

 

(d) The covenants contained in this Section 5.7 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons and
their respective heirs and legal Representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Person is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

67  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

(e) In the event that Purchaser, any Target Company or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or
assigns of Purchaser or such Target Company, as the case may be, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7.

 

 

(f) The obligations of Purchaser under this Section 5.7 shall survive the
Closing and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to affect
adversely any Indemnified Person to whom this Section 5.7 applies without the
consent of such affected Indemnified Person (it being expressly agreed that
the Indemnified Persons to whom this Section 5.7 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.7, each of whom may enforce the provisions of
this Section 5.7).

 

 

(g) As of the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Selling Entities to,
on behalf of themselves and any entity controlled by them and their
respective successors, assigns and heirs, release, remise and discharge
absolutely and forever, all other equityholders of the Target Companies and
each Target Company, and each of such parties\' successors and assigns of and
from any and all manner of Actions, Losses, costs or expenses (other than in
respect of the current assets and current liabilities of the type referenced
in clause (d) of the definition of "Working Capital") of any nature
whatsoever, known or unknown, fixed or contingent, relating to or arising out
of the operation or conduct of any business, assets (including activities
performed thereat), or operations managed or operated by, or operationally
related to, directly or indirectly, the PBM Business, including any Actions
relating to or arising out of the provision of services by the Target
Companies to Seller or any of its Affiliates or affiliated health plans, in
each case, that shall have accrued theretofore based on any circumstances or
state of fact existing or arising on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

Section 5.8 Public Announcements. Purchaser and Seller shall develop a
joint communications plan and each party shall (i) ensure that all press
releases and other public statements and public communications with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be consistent with such joint communications plan and (ii) unless otherwise
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, each party shall consult
with the other for a reasonable time before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statement or public communication, and Purchaser
and Seller shall mutually agree upon any such press release or any such
public statement or public communication, with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition to the foregoing,
except as required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with or rules of any securities exchange, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall
issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or public
disclosure concerning the other party or the other Party\'s business,
financial condition or results of operations without the consent of the other
Party. The foregoing limitations of this Section 5.8 shall not apply to any
disclosure of any information concerning this Agreement or

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Other Transaction Documents in connection with any dispute between the
Parties regarding this Agreement or the Other Transaction Documents.

 

 

Section 5.9 Notification of Certain Matters. Purchaser, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand, will promptly notify each other of (i)
any Actions, commenced or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser or the Knowledge
of Seller, threatened, against Seller, any Target Company, Purchaser or any
of their respective Affiliates or Representatives and (ii) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any fact or event that, in either case, would be reasonably
likely to cause any condition set forth in Article VI not to be satisfied;
provided, that no such notification, nor the obligation to make such
notification, shall affect the representations, warranties or covenants or
agreements of any Party or the conditions to the obligations of any Party.
Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser of its receipt of any notice in
writing or claim of default under, any Material Contract, or any written
notice of any intent to terminate, not renew or challenge the validity or
enforceability of any Material Contract.

 

 

Section 5.10 Preservation of Records; Audit Assistance. xxv) For a period of
seven (7) years after the Closing Date or such other period required by
applicable Law, Purchaser and the Target Companies shall preserve and retain,
all corporate, accounting, legal, auditing, human resources and other books
and records of each Target Company (including any documents relating to any
governmental or non-governmental claims, actions, suits, proceedings or
investigations, collectively the "Company Records") relating to the conduct
of the business and operations of the Target Companies prior to the
Closing Date. During such seven (7) year period, none of Purchaser and the
Target Companies (or their respective successors and assigns) shall destroy
or dispose of or allow the destruction or disposition of any Company Records,
without first having offered in writing to deliver such Company Records
to Seller. Purchaser and the Target Companies (or their
respective successors and assigns) shall be entitled to dispose of the
Company Records if Seller shall fail to request copies of such Company
Records within one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the
notice described in the preceding sentence.

 

 

(b) After the Closing, Seller and its Representatives (including its outside
accountants) shall have reasonable access, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable notice, to the Company Records and to personnel of the
Target Companies and to any other information or personnel that Seller
reasonably requests, solely in connection with Seller completing the audit of
its accounts for the 2009 fiscal year. In addition, in the event the
financial statements of the Target Companies are audited for the period from
the Balance Sheet Date through the Closing Date, upon execution of a
customary access letter if required by Purchaser\'s or the Target Companies\'
outside accountants, Seller and its Representatives (including its outside
accountants) shall be granted access to all relevant work papers, schedules,
memoranda and other documents prepared by the Target Companies or their
Representatives (including its outside accountants) for such audit in
connection with Seller completing the audit of its accounts for the 2009
fiscal year.

 

 

Section 5.11 Resignation of Officers and Directors. At the request
of Purchaser, Seller shall cause each officer and member of the Boards of
Directors of each Target Company to tender his resignation from such
position effective as of the Closing. No such requested

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

69  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resignation of an officer of any Target Company shall be deemed a voluntary
resignation for purposes of any employment agreements and will not terminate,
reduce or modify any severance or other rights thereunder.

 



 

Section 5.12 Insurance Matters. Purchaser acknowledges that coverage for
the Target Companies under the Seller Insurance Policies will cease as of the
Closing Date, and that neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will
purchase any "tail" policy or other additional or substitute coverage for the
benefit of Purchaser relating to the Seller Insurance Policies or the Target
Companies applicable in any period after the Closing Date. Following the
Closing, Seller agrees to cooperate with Purchaser and the Target Companies
in making claims under the Seller Insurance Policies with respect to
occurrences, accidents, incidents or claims regarding the Target Companies
that occurred prior to the Closing Date, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain and remit promptly any recoveries (net of
deductibles) under such Seller Insurance Policies with respect thereto, to
the extent received by Seller or any of its Affiliates, to Purchaser.

 

 

Section 5.13 Marks. Following the Closing Date and except as otherwise
expressly permitted hereunder or in writing by Seller, Purchaser shall ensure
that Purchaser, the Target Companies, and their respective Affiliates do not,
register, or attempt to register, and do not use, in any fashion,
including in signage, corporate letterhead, business cards, Internet web
sites, marketing material or content and the like, or seek to register, in
connection with any products or services anywhere in the world in any medium,
any trademark, service mark, domain name, corporate name, trade name or other
indicia of origin that is confusingly similar to any of the trademarks,
service marks, domain names, corporate names, trade names or other indicia of
origin (including the term "NextRx") that are owned as of the Closing Date by
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than any Target Companies)
and listed on Schedule 5.13 of the Seller Disclosure Letter (collectively,
"Seller\'s Marks"). The absence of any trademarks, service marks, domain
names, corporate names, trade names or other indicia of origin of Seller or
any of its Affiliates from the aforementioned Schedule 5.13 shall not be
deemed a waiver of any rights therein that Seller or its Affiliates (other
than the Target Companies) may possess and no license in favor of Purchaser
or the Target Companies shall be implied by such absence. Any provisions
contained in any Contracts between Seller or any Affiliate of Seller on the
one hand and any Target Company on the other hand relating to the use of the
Seller\'s Marks, including all name protection and license agreements, shall
immediately and automatically terminate as of the Closing Date. Except
as otherwise expressly permitted in writing by Seller, Purchaser shall
ensure that, as soon as practical (but in no event more than six (6) months
following the Closing Date with respect to materials that publicly display
Seller\'s Marks or are otherwise distributed to the public (including
letterhead, advertising materials, marketing brochures and the like)), any
such materials bearing Seller\'s Marks are either destroyed or otherwise
permanently altered to entirely remove Seller\'s Marks. Furthermore,
unless otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement, Purchaser
shall ensure that, as soon as practical (but in no event more than thirty
(30) days following the Closing Date) any hypertext links to Internet web
sites operated by Seller or its Affiliates and any other use of Seller\'s
Marks are removed from any Internet web sites operated by the Target
Companies; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, unless
otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement, Purchaser
shall ensure such removal on or before the fifth (5th) Business Day after it
or the Target Companies become aware

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

70  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

of such links or use. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section
5.13 shall preclude any references to the Seller\'s Marks that are required
by Law, that constitute "fair use" under applicable Law, or that are
in historical, tax, and similar records. Except as otherwise
expressly permitted in writing by Purchaser or for purposes of licensing
Purchaser, in Seller\'s sole discretion, to use such marks during the
transition period following the Closing, after the Closing Date and for a
period of five (5) years thereafter, Seller agrees that neither Seller nor
its Affiliates will transfer, assign, use, license or authorize other Persons
to use the trademarks "NEXTRX" or "PRECISIONRX" in connection with a business
that is directly competitive with the PBM Business. After the Closing Date,
Purchaser and its Affiliates, including the Target Companies, shall not adopt
or use the trademarks "NEXTRX" or "PRECISIONRX" in connection with any goods
or services, except as expressly permitted in writing by Seller (for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein shall preclude Purchaser\'s and
the Target Companies\' use of such trademarks in connection with the PBM
Business for a period of up to six (6) months following the Closing Date (or
such further period as Seller may, in its sole discretion, allow), solely in
connection with phasing out use of such trademarks and in a manner generally
consistent with past practice and quality standards in place as of the
effective date of this Agreement).

 

 

Section 5.14 Supply Agreement. Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and their
respective stockholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors
and assigns (other than the Target Companies) (each a "Seller Indemnitee")
from and against, and shall pay, any Losses suffered, incurred or paid,
directly or indirectly, by any Seller Indemnitee after the Closing relating
to any conduct or omissions by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Target Companies following the Closing) that occur after the
Closing as a result of, in connection with or arising out of the Supply
Agreement. Following the Closing, Purchaser shall and shall cause the Target
Companies to pay all reasonable fees and expenses of the Seller Indemnitees
in connection with the conduct and omissions referenced in the preceding
sentence promptly as statements therefor are received. The obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless and pay fees and expenses pursuant to this
Section 5.14 shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement until final resolution thereof. Purchaser shall have the
sole and exclusive right to defend with counsel of its choosing and settle
(with the prior written consent of Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld)
any action brought against any Seller Indemnitee as a result of, in
connection with or arising out of the Supply Agreement and with respect to
which indemnification under this Section 5.14 is sought; provided, that
Seller shall be permitted to participate in the defense of any such
litigation at its sole cost and expense on issues relating to Seller, the
direct and indirect Subsidiaries of Seller, and each of their
respective successors and assigns, Affiliates, officers, directors,
current and former employees, agents and attorneys (collectively, the
"Seller Persons"); and, provided, further, that Seller shall be permitted to
control the defense of any such action on issues relating to any Seller
Person if Seller has been advised in writing by counsel that a reasonable
likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between Seller and Purchaser in
connection with the defense of such issues. In the event any Seller Person
remains (or is later named) as a defendant or co-defendant in such action,
neither Purchaser nor Seller shall enter into any settlement of such action
without the consent of the other unless such settlement provides for a
complete and unconditional release of Purchaser, the direct and indirect
Subsidiaries of Purchaser, and each of their respective successors
and assigns,

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

71  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Affiliates, officers, directors, current and former employees, agents and
attorneys (collectively, the "Purchaser Persons") or all Seller Indemnitees,
as the case may be, of all liability with respect to such action, the terms
thereof do not otherwise impose any injunctive or other equitable or
nonmonetary remedies on any Purchaser Person or Seller Indemnitee, as the
case may be, or include in such settlement any penalty or exemplary or
punitive damages, and in the case of the Seller Indemnitees, Purchaser agrees
to pay (or reimburse Seller, as the case may be) all Losses suffered,
incurred or paid by the Seller Indemnitees. Seller shall, and shall cause
each of its Affiliates to, and shall use appropriate efforts to cause each
other Seller Person to, cooperate fully with Purchaser in connection with any
such action. This cooperation will include, but not be limited to, the
following: (i) if requested by Purchaser, requiring employees to appear for
interviews, at reasonable times and locations and upon reasonable advance
notice; (ii) requiring employees to answer all questions
truthfully concerning any Seller Person or concerning their work for any
Seller Person; (iii) producing all records relating to any Seller Indemnitee
within the possession, custody or control of such Person which they are
requested to produce by Purchaser; (iv) upon reasonable advance notice from
Purchaser, requiring employees to appear for depositions and/or at trial
related to any claim, Action or litigation in which any Seller Indemnitee is,
or may become, a party, that is in any manner related to any such litigation;
and (v) upon reasonable advance notice requiring employees to meet with
Representatives of Purchaser to assist Purchaser in preparation for such
depositions and/or trials. Purchaser shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) incurred by any
Seller Person in connection with such assistance. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser shall have no obligations under
this Section 5.14 unless, and until, the Closing shall have occurred.

 



 

Section 5.15 Conflicts; Privileges.

 

 

(a) Services. The Parties agree and acknowledge that legal and other
professional services have been or will be provided which have been or will
be rendered solely for the benefit of Purchaser or the Target Companies,
on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, as the case may be.
With respect to such services, the parties agree that Purchaser and the
Target Companies, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall be
entitled, in perpetuity, to control the assertion or waiver of all privileges
in connection with such privileged information which relates solely to (x)
the PBM Business or any claims related thereto, in the case of Purchaser and
the Target Companies and (y) the Non-PBM Business or any claims related
thereto, in the case of Seller, whether or not the privileged information is
in the possession of or under the control of the parties that control the
assertion or waiver of such privileges; provided, however, that, from and
after the Closing, Purchaser will not waive, and will cause the Target
Companies not to waive, any privilege attaching as a result of legal counsel
representing any Target Company prior to the Closing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of Seller.
It is further acknowledged by each of the Parties that Seller has retained
each of White and Case LLP ("WandC") and Hogan and Hartson LLP ("Hogan") to act as
its counsel, and that Purchaser has retained each of Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP ("Skadden") and Ropes and Gray LLP ("Ropes") to act
as its counsel, in each case, in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that none of Skadden, WandC, Ropes or Hogan has acted as
counsel for any other Person in connection with the transactions

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

72  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contemplated hereby and that no other Party or Person has the status of a
client of Skadden, WandC, Ropes or Hogan for conflict of interest or any other
purposes as a result thereof. Purchaser hereby waives, on its own behalf and,
after the Closing, agrees to cause the Target Companies to waive, any
conflicts that may arise in connection with (a) WandC and/or Hogan representing
Seller after the Closing and (b) the communication by WandC and/or Hogan to
Seller, in any such representation, of any fact known to WandC and/or Hogan, in
each case including in connection with (x) a dispute with Purchaser, or any
of its Affiliates following the Closing or (y) the defense of any third party
claim giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder by Purchaser
Indemnified Parties.

 

 

(b) Shared Privilege. The Parties agree that they shall have a shared
privilege, with equal right to assert or waive, subject to the restrictions
in this Section 5.15, with respect to all privileges not allocated pursuant
to the terms of Section 5.15(a). Except as provided in Section 5.15(c), no
party may waive any privilege that could be asserted under any applicable
Law and in which another party has a shared privilege without obtaining the
prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned).

 

 

(c) Disputes. In the event of any action, suit, claim, investigation or
proceeding between or among any of the parties, Purchaser and the Target
Companies, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, may waive
a privilege in which the other has a shared privilege, without obtaining
consent; provided, that such waiver of a shared privilege shall be effective
only as to the use of information with respect to the action, suit, claim,
investigation or proceeding between the parties and shall not operate as a
waiver of the shared privilege with respect to third parties.

 

 

Section 5.16 Section 338 Election; Tax Treatment Matters. (a) Seller and
Purchaser shall jointly complete and make an election under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (with respect to NextRx and NextRx Services
(each, a "Section 338 Company")) on Form 8023 or in such other manner as may
be required by rule or regulation of the IRS, and shall jointly make an
election in the manner required under any analogous provisions of state or
local Law as Purchaser shall designate or as shall be required, concerning
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser shall, with the
assistance and cooperation of Seller, prepare all such Section 338(h)(10)
forms required as attachments to IRS Form 8023 (and all forms under analogous
provisions of state or local Law) in accordance with applicable Tax Laws, and
Purchaser shall deliver such forms and related documents to Seller at least
ninety (90) days prior to the due date of filing. Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser at least seventy-five (75) days prior to the due date of filing
such completed forms as are required to be filed under Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code (and analogous provisions of state or local Law).

 

 

 

(b) The Parties will treat the purchase by Purchaser of the LLC Interest
contemplated hereunder as a purchase of assets by Purchaser
from Community Insurance for federal, state and local income tax purposes
unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Purchaser and Seller will file
all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such treatment, and

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

73  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will take no position inconsistent with that characterization for federal,
state or local income tax purposes, including in any audit or judicial or
administrative proceeding.

 

 

(c) This Agreement shall constitute the plan of complete liquidation of each
Section 338 Company for purposes of Section 332 of the Code.

 

 

(d) Except as provided in Section 5.16(a), Purchaser shall not make any
election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the Target Companies.

 

 

Section 5.17 Allocation of Purchase Price. (a) Within thirty (30) days after
the date hereof, Seller shall provide to Purchaser: (i) as required
by Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and
any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, as appropriate), a
proposed allocation of the LLC Interest Consideration among the assets of
NextRx LLC (the "Initial 1060 Allocations"); (ii) as required by Section 338
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law, as appropriate), a proposed
allocation of the NextRx Consideration and the liabilities of NextRx among
the assets of NextRx; and (iii) as required by Section 338 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of state,
local or foreign Law, as appropriate), a proposed allocation of the NextRx
Services Consideration and the liabilities of NextRx Services among the
assets of NextRx Services ((ii) and (iii) collectively, the "Initial 338
Valuations and Allocations"). If Purchaser does not object to the Initial
1060 Allocations and Initial 338 Valuations and Allocations within thirty
(30) days of receipt, such valuations and allocations shall be deemed to have
been accepted and agreed upon, and subject to Section 5.17(b) below, final
and conclusive, for all purposes of this Agreement. If Purchaser objects to
the Initial 1060 Allocations or Initial 338 Valuations and Allocations, it
shall notify Seller of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for
its objection, and Purchaser and Seller shall resolve any such dispute prior
to the Closing Date (whether pursuant to this sentence or the immediately
preceding sentence, such agreed upon Initial 1060 Allocations, the
"1060 Allocations" and such agreed upon Initial 338 Valuations and
Allocations, the "338 Valuations and Allocations").

 

 

(b) Within 30 days of the Post-Closing Adjustment, Seller and Purchaser agree
to adjust the 1060 Allocations and 338 Valuations and Allocations solely to
reflect (i) any differences between the Class I assets, Class II assets,
Class III assets, Class IV assets and Class V assets, each as defined
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-6, shown on the Balance Sheet as at
the Balance Sheet Date and the Closing Balance Sheet and (ii) any purchase
price adjustment under Section 2.5 (which adjustment shall be allocated to
the Target Company to which such adjustment relates, and shall be
further allocated to the assets to which such adjustment relates) (such
adjusted 1060 Allocations, the "Final 1060 Allocations" and such adjusted
338 Valuations and Allocations, the "Final 338 Valuations and Allocations").
The Final 1060 Allocations and Final 338 Valuations and Allocations
determined pursuant to this Section 5.17(b) (as adjusted by the Parties in
accordance with Treasury Regulations Sections 1.338-4 or 1.338-5, as
applicable, to account for their respective costs) shall be used for purposes
of all relevant Tax Returns, reports and filings (including the preparation
of IRS Form 8594 and IRS Forms 8883 as such

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

74  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forms relate to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and neither
Seller nor Purchaser shall take any position that is inconsistent therewith
unless required pursuant to a final determination of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser and Seller
acknowledge and agree that for purpose of the purchase price allocations
prepared under this Section 5.17, (i) the Balance Sheet as at the
Balance Sheet Date shall be used as a starting point and (ii) the amount paid
(including the LLC Interest Consideration, the NextRx Consideration, and the
NextRx Services Consideration) for the NextRx LLC Interests, NextRx Shares
and NextRx Services Shares, respectively, as adjusted, together with the
liabilities assumed by Purchaser in each case shall be separately allocated
among the assets of NextRx LLC, NextRx, and NextRx Services, respectively ,
based on the following methodology, all in accordance with Section 338 of the
Code or Section 1060 of the Code, as applicable, and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder or other applicable law: (A) the Class I assets, Class
II assets, Class III assets, Class IV assets and Class V assets, each
as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-6, shall be treated as
having a fair market value equal to the net book value of such asset on the
Closing Date; (B) any remaining amount after allocation to the assets in
Classes I through V shall be allocated to the assets constituting Class VI or
VII assets, as defined in U.S. Treasury Regulation §1.338-6; and (C) where
the net book value of an asset is used in the allocation methodology set
forth above, the Parties acknowledge and agree that such net book value is
representative of the asset\'s fair market value.

 

 

Section 5.18 Cooperation with Financing. Seller and the Target Companies
shall provide, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries, and shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to cause each of its and their
respective Representatives, including legal, tax, regulatory and accounting,
to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection
with the Financing (provided that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Seller or any of the
Target Companies), including (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable
providing information (financial or otherwise) relating to the Target
Companies to the Persons providing the Financing (the "Financing Parties")

Companies shall (i) have any liability or any obligation under any agreement
or document related to the Financing or (ii) be required to incur any other
liability in connection with the Financing unless reimbursed or reasonably
satisfactorily indemnified by Purchaser. Without limitation to the foregoing,
Seller and the Target Companies shall provide, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries, and shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause each of its and their respective Representatives, including
legal, tax, regulatory and accounting to provide, all other information and
cooperation reasonably requested by the Financing Parties pursuant to the

(b) Purchaser and Seller shall work in good faith, devote necessary resources
and, subject to applicable Law, share all data and other information

integrate Seller and Purchaser fulfillment routing systems; (3) design,
develop, test, and conduct quality assurance testing of such systems'
capability; (4) build out of Seller's and Purchaser's claim adjudication
systems to capture Seller and Purchaser's margin and ASO margin capabilities
and (5) build out of Purchaser's systems' capability to process claims files

to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser. Each of Purchaser and Seller
shall use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to implement the
Integrated Service Delivery Model and complete the build out of its system
as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in any
event, prior to December 31, 2009, (it being understood that if, after using
its commercially reasonable efforts, the Integrated Service Delivery Model is
not completed by such time, the parties shall amend Annex A-1 to the

no less than a monthly basis) for its reasonable documented costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the Integrated Service Delivery Model.
In the event the foregoing transition projects are not completed prior to the
Closing, and the Closing occurs, Purchaser shall also reimburse Seller
promptly upon its request for its reasonable documented costs and expenses
incurred after the Closing in connection with the completion of the foregoing
transition projects to the extent such post-Closing costs and expenses are
not otherwise included in the fees payable to Seller by Purchaser as set
forth on Annex A-1 of the Transition Services Agreement. In no event shall
the reimbursement of Seller's reasonable documented costs and expenses under
this Section 5.19(b) and any Service added to Annex A-1 of the Transition
Services Agreement as a result of the operation of this Section 5.19(b)
exceed $5,000,000 in the aggregate.

Plano facility on the Closing Date as compared to the total number of
Purchaser and Seller associates employed at the Plano facility on the Closing

Article VI shall be satisfied or by their terms cannot be satisfied until or
immediately preceding the Closing, but which conditions would be satisfied if
the Closing Date were the End Date, then the End Date shall be extended to
April 9, 2010 if Purchaser or Seller notifies the other on or prior to the
End Date of its election to extend the End Date to April 9, 2010; or

(c) by Purchaser, if prior to the Closing Date there shall have been a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part
of Seller contained in this Agreement or any representation or warranty of
Seller shall have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, which such
breach or untrue representation or warranty (A) would, individually or in
the aggregate with all other such breaches and untrue representations and
warranties, give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Sections
6.2(a) or 6.2(b) and (B) is incapable of being cured prior to the Closing
Date by Seller or is not cured within thirty (30) days of notice of such
breach; or

 

 

(d) by Seller, if prior to the Closing Date there shall have been a breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement or any representation or warranty of Purchaser
shall have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, which such breach
or untrue representation or warranty (A) would, individually or in the
aggregate with all other such breaches and untrue representations
and warranties, give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Sections

Date by the relevant Party or is not cured within thirty (30) days of notice
of such breach.

 

 

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. (a) In the event of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b), 8.1(c) or 8.1(d), written notice
thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating Party to the other Party
specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made.
In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1,
this Agreement shall be terminated and become void and have no effect, and
there shall be no liability hereunder on the part of Seller, any Seller
Entity, Purchaser or any Target Company, except that Section 5.5(b), Article
X (other than Section 10.12) and this Section 8.2 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 8.2 shall relieve any Party to this Agreement of liability for its
material breach of this Agreement, except as set forth in Section 8.2(c) with
respect to the rights of Seller. For avoidance of doubt, the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement survive termination of this
Agreement for any reason.

 

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either Party pursuant
to Section 8.1(b)(i) or 8.1(b)(ii) and, in each of the foregoing cases, at
such time all of the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI (other than
(A) any conditions in Section 6.1(b); (B) any conditions in Sections 6.1(a),
6.2(d) or 6.3(d), to the extent such conditions relate to Orders, consents,
approvals or authorizations of or issued under U.S. Antitrust Laws; and (C)
any conditions precedent that by their terms cannot be satisfied until or
immediately preceding the Closing, but in the case of clause (C), which
conditions precedent would be satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of
such termination) have been satisfied or waived on or prior to the date of
such termination, Purchaser shall pay to Seller a termination fee in cash
equal to $50,000,000 (the "Reverse Termination Fee"), which shall be paid
within two (2) Business Days after delivery of a written notice of
termination pursuant to Section 8.2(a); provided, that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser shall not be obligated to pay the Reverse Termination
Fee if either (x) Seller\'s refusal to agree to any Burdensome Term or
Condition or (y) Seller\'s

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

87  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breach of its obligations under Section 5.5 has been a material cause of the
failure of such conditions in Sections 6.1(a), 6.1(b), 6.2(d) or 6.3(d).
All payments under this Section 8.2(b) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated in writing by
Seller. If Purchaser shall fail to pay the Reverse Termination Fee when due
in accordance with this Section 8.2(b), Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for
all costs and expenses incurred or accrued by Seller (including fees and
expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement
of this Section 8.2(b) from the date such payment was required to be made
until the date of payment plus interest on the Reverse Termination Fee and
the amount of such costs and expenses at the prime lending rate prevailing
during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal plus five percent
(5%).

 

 

(c) In the event that Seller shall have the right to receive the Reverse
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(b), Seller\'s right to receive
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee (if any), any other
amounts specifically referred to in Section 8.2(b) and any other amounts
contemplated by Section 5.5(b) from Purchaser shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy against Purchaser and any of Purchaser\'s Subsidiaries or Affiliates
for any and all Losses suffered in connection with, or as a result of the
failure, of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Other
Transaction Documents to be consummated (collectively, the "Seller Damages")
(except in the case of willful and material breach by Purchaser), and upon
payment of any and all such amounts, as applicable, none of Purchaser, nor
any of Purchaser\'s Subsidiaries nor any of their respective former, current
or future stockholders, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents
(collectively, the "Purchaser Affiliates") shall have any further liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the
Other Transaction Documents, or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby and the only liability, in the aggregate, of Purchaser shall be
the Seller Damages (except in the case of willful and material breach by
Purchaser), and in no event shall Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates seek any other recovery, judgment or damages of any kind,
including consequential, indirect or punitive damages, against Purchaser or
any Purchaser Affiliate through Purchaser or otherwise, whether by or through
a claim by or on behalf of Purchaser against any Purchaser Affiliate, by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding,
by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise, except
(i) for its rights to recover Seller Damages under and to the extent provided
in this Section 8.2 and (ii) in the case of willful and material breach by
Purchaser. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful and material breach"
shall mean a material breach that is a consequence of an act or
omission knowingly undertaken by the breaching party with the primary intent
of causing a breach of this Agreement.

Capital Amount and (b) the difference of (i) any amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Party under insurance policies with respect to such Losses minus
(ii) the total of the cost of such recovery and the reasonably expected
increased cost of premiums for the insurance policy under which the
Indemnified Party recovered.

 

 

(d) Materiality; Knowledge. For purposes of this Article IX only, a breach of
a representation or warranty shall be deemed to exist either if such
representation or warranty is actually inaccurate or breached or would have
been inaccurate or breached if such representation or warranty had not

Section 9.5 Indemnification Procedures.

 

 

 

(a) Notice of Claims. Any Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Article IX (the "Indemnified Party") shall notify any other Person (or
Persons) who is (are) obligated to provide indemnification hereunder (the
"Indemnifying Party") promptly after becoming aware of any Losses which the
Indemnified Party shall have determined has given or could give rise to a
claim for indemnification under Section 9.2 or Section 9.3. Such notice shall
include an estimate of the Losses that the Indemnified Party has determined
may be incurred (the "Claim Notice") and such Claim Notice shall specify in
reasonable detail, to the extent reasonably practicable and to the extent
within the Knowledge of the Indemnified Party, each individual item of Loss
included in the amount so stated, the date such item was paid, the basis for
any anticipated liability and the nature of the misrepresentation, and
the breach of warranty, breach of covenant or claim to which each such item
is related. It is agreed that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party
in notifying any Indemnifying Party of a claim (including any third party
claim) will relieve the Indemnifying Party thereby unless (and then only to
the extent) said Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by
such failure to give notice. It is agreed that no Person shall be liable for
any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article IX unless the Claim
Notice is delivered by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party prior
to the expiration of the applicable survival period. If the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not dispute the claim or
the estimated amount of Losses described in such notice, or fails to notify
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after delivery of such notice
by the Indemnified Party whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim or
the estimated amount of Losses described in such notice, the estimated Losses
in the amount specified in the Indemnified Party\'s notice will be
conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Losses to the Indemnified
Party within ten (10) Business Days after the expiration of such thirty (30)
day period. If the Indemnified Party has timely disputed its liability with
respect to such claim or the estimated amount of Losses, and such dispute has
not been resolved within sixty (60) days, then the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party may seek legal redress in accordance with Section 10.8.

 

 

(b) Matters Involving Third Parties. Other than with respect to matters
relating to Taxes, which shall be governed solely by Article VII, if the
Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of any claim or demand
for indemnification asserted by a third party (it being agreed that no
delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying
Party of any third party claim will relieve the Indemnifying Party thereby
unless (and then only to the extent) said Indemnifying Party is actually and
materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice), the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right (i) to employ counsel, at its own expense,
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to defend any such claim or
demand asserted against the Indemnified Party, (ii) to jointly control and
conduct with the Indemnified Party any proceedings or negotiations
in connection therewith and necessary or appropriate to defend the
Indemnified Party, unless the Indemnifying Party shall have agreed that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX
with respect to such third party claim, in which case, the Indemnifying Party
shall have the sole right to control

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

93  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and conduct any such proceedings or negotiations, and (iii) so long as
the Indemnifying Party shall have agreed that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX with respect to such
third party claim, to take all other steps or proceedings to settle or defend
any such claims; unless such third party claim (A) seeks an injunction or
other equitable remedies in respect of the Indemnified Party or its business;
(B) may result in liabilities which, taken with other then existing Losses
under this Article IX, would not be fully indemnified hereunder; (C) may have
an adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the Indemnified
Party after the Closing Date (including an effect on the Tax liabilities,
earnings or ongoing business relationships of the Indemnified Party) or (D)
relates to the operation of the PBM Business after the Closing Date. The
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense
of such third party claims (provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
required to provide such cooperation if there shall be any dispute between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party regarding the Indemnified
Party\'s right to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX with respect to
any such third party claim), with such cooperation to include (x) the
retention and the provision of the Indemnified Party\'s records and
information that are reasonably relevant to such third party claim, and (y)
the making available of employees on a mutually convenient basis for
providing additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. In the case of any settlement that provides for any relief other
than the payment of monetary damages as to which the Indemnified Party will
be indemnified in full, such settlement shall include a release of the
Indemnified Party from any and all liability with respect to such claim and
shall only be made with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnifying
Party shall notify the Indemnified Party in writing, as promptly as possible
after receipt of the notice of a third party claim (but in any case within
thirty (30) days of receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a notice of a third
party claim or such earlier time necessary to reasonably allow a timely
response to the claim (the "Indemnifying Notice Period")) of its election to
defend any such third party claim or demand. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense as provided in the preceding two
sentences, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in such
defense (including with counsel of its choice), at its sole expense, and the
Indemnifying Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party in
connection with such participation. If the Indemnifying Party does not
deliver to the Indemnified Party written notice within the Indemnity Notice
Period that the Indemnifying Party will assume the defense of any such claim
or litigation resulting therefrom, the Indemnified Party may defend against
any such claim or litigation in such manner as it may deem reasonably
appropriate, at the cost of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party
may settle such claim or litigation or agree to pay in full such claim or
demand, which shall only be made with the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not assume
the defense as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in such defense
(including with counsel of its choice), at its own expense, and the
Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in
connection with such participation. In all cases the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party shall keep each other reasonably informed as to all
matters concerning any third party claim and shall promptly notify the other
Party in writing of any and all significant developments relating thereto.

respect to any and all claims arising out of, in connection with or
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement will be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in Article VII and this Article IX.
The limitations of the foregoing sentence shall not apply to any claim based
on fraud. Nothing in this Section 9.7(a) will prohibit claims for equitable
relief made by an Indemnified Party.

 

 

(b) Subrogation. Upon making any payment to any Indemnified Party for any
indemnification claim pursuant to this Article IX, the Indemnifying Party
will be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights that the
Indemnified Party may have against other Persons with respect to the subject
matter of such indemnification claim.

Section 10.5 Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. This Agreement shall inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and, with respect to the
provisions of Section 5.7 shall inure to the benefit of the Persons
benefiting from the provisions thereof all of whom are intended to be third
party beneficiaries thereof. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the
sole benefit of the Parties, in accordance with and subject to the terms
of this Agreement, and are not necessarily intended as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date. Accordingly, without limiting anything else in this Section, the
representations and warranties made herein are not intended to, and do
not confer upon any Person (other than, to the extent expressly permitted,
such Person\'s assigns) any rights or remedies hereunder. Neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder
shall be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of the other
Party, except that Purchaser may transfer or assign to any of its
Subsidiaries, in whole or from time to time in part, its rights and
obligations under the terms of this Agreement (other than pursuant to
Sections 2.3 and 2.4(c)(iii)); provided, that in no event shall any such
transfer or assignment relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder or
thereunder.

 

 

Section 10.6 Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by Purchaser and Seller, or in the case
of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No
failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Law.

 

 

Section 10.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of
which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument.

 

 

Section 10.8 Governing Law. This Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and all disputes between the Parties under or related to
this Agreement or the facts and circumstances leading to its execution,
whether in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of New York (except for
Section 5-1401 and Section 5-1402 of the General Obligations Laws of the
State of New York), applicable to Contracts executed in and to be performed
entirely within the State of New York.

 

 

Section 10.9 Litigation; Waiver of Jury Trial. (a) Any dispute, controversy
or claim among the Parties that arises out of, relat­es to or is in any
manner connected with this Agreement, including any question regarding the
validity, termi­nation of, or performance or non-performance under, this
Agreement, any breach of this Agreement, or any other claim (including tort
claims) that arises out of, relates to or is in any manner connected with

exclusively to the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York or the state courts located in the State of New York, and, by

jurisdiction of such courts, and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any
judgment rendered thereby in connection with this Agreement. The foregoing
consents to jurisdiction and appointments of agents to receive service of
process shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the
State of New York for any purpose except as provided above and shall not be
deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties. The prevailing
party or parties in any such litigation shall be entitled to receive from the
losing party or parties all costs and expenses, including reasonable counsel
fees, incurred by the prevailing party or parties.

 

 

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, AND AGREES TO CAUSE ITS
RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES TO WAIVE, ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

 

Section 10.10 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
contained in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory
policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions
contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and this Agreement shall be
reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable term, provision, covenant or restriction or any
portion thereof had never been contained herein.

 

 

Section 10.11 Specific Enforcement. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 

 

Section 10.12 Additional Cooperation. Following the date of this Agreement,
Purchaser and Seller agree to adopt and implement, as promptly as
practicable, procedures, consistent with applicable antitrust Laws, to
provide reasonable assurances that (i) Purchaser will not directly
or indirectly control or direct the operations of the Target Companies prior
to the Closing and (ii) Seller will not directly or indirectly control or
direct the operations of Purchaser or its Affiliates, in both cases in
violation of applicable antitrust Laws. The Parties shall reasonably consult
in connection with the development of such procedures and such procedures
shall be subject to the consent of the other Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) prior to adoption and implementation
thereof.

 

 

Section 10.13 Rules of Construction. The Parties agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or document.
