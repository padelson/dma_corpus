      Section 1.01 The Merger. (a) At the Effective Time, and subject to and
upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the DGCL, Merger Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation").

      Section 1.02 Effective Time. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated and the transactions herein contemplated shall have been abandoned
pursuant to Section 7.01, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
two business days) after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article VI, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing a properly executed agreement or certificate of merger as contemplated by
the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger"), together with any required related
certificates, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form
as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time of such filing or at such
later time, which will be as soon as reasonably practicable, specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time"). Prior to such filing, a closing
shall be held at the offices of Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP, 919 Third
Avenue, New York, NY, unless another time or place is agreed to in writing by
the parties hereto, for the purpose of confirming the satisfaction or waiver, as
the case may be, of the conditions set forth in Article VI.

      Section 1.03 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

      Section 1.04 Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws. (a) Subject to Section
5.06, at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided
by law and such Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

      (b) Subject to Section 5.06, at the Effective Time, the By-laws of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended.

      Section 1.05 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of

      Section 1.06 Effect on Securities, Etc. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any securities of the Company:

      (a) Conversion of Securities. (i) Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Shares to be canceled
pursuant to Section 1.06(b)) shall be converted, subject to Sections 1.06 (e)
and (f), into the right to receive from Parent that number of fully paid and
nonassessable common shares of Guarantor, par value U.S. $0.20 per share (the
"Guarantor Common Shares"), equal to the Exchange Ratio.

      For purposes of this Agreement:

of the Daily Per Share Prices for the five consecutive trading days ending on
the fourth trading day immediately preceding the date of the Company's
Stockholders Meeting.

      "Daily Per Share Price" for any trading day means the volume-weighted
average (rounded to the nearest 1/10,000) of the per share selling price on the
NYSE of Guarantor Common Shares for that day, as reported by Bloomberg Financial
Markets (or if such service is unavailable, a service providing similar
information selected by Parent and the Company).

      "Exchange Ratio" means $23.00 divided by the Average Share Price, subject
to adjustment as provided in Section 7.01(j).

      "NYSE" means the New York Stock Exchange.

      (b) Cancellation. Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each
Share owned by Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect, wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company or Guarantor immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, be canceled and retired without payment
of any consideration therefor and cease to exist.

      (c) Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plans. At the Effective Time,
all options ("Company Stock Options") to purchase Company Common Stock then
outstanding, whether under (i) the Company's Key Employee Stock Option Plan,
(ii) the Company's Director's Stock Option Plan, or (iii) otherwise, shall be
treated in accordance with Section 5.11 of this Agreement. Rights to purchase
shares of Company Stock outstanding under any employee stock purchase or
restricted stock plan or any similar U.S. or non-U.S. plan (collectively, the
"Company ESPP") shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.11 of this Agreement.
Any rights to purchase Company Common Stock under the Company's 401(k) plans
shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.12 of this Agreement.

      (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, $0.01 par
value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of

                                      8
<PAGE>

common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Following
the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger
Sub common stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

      (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio, Etc. If, during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Guarantor or the Company shall occur, including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record
date during such period or the exercise of the Rights, the Exchange Ratio, the
Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to the Merger or
otherwise pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

      (f) Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing less than one
Guarantor Common Share shall be issued in exchange for Shares upon the surrender
for exchange of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares (the "Certificates"). In lieu of any such
fractional share, each holder of Shares who would otherwise have been entitled
to a fraction of a Guarantor Common Share upon surrender of Certificates for
exchange shall be paid upon such surrender (and after taking into account all
certificates surrendered by such holder) cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to such fraction multiplied by the Average Share Price.

      Section 1.07 Exchange of Shares. (a) Exchange Agent. Parent shall cause to
be supplied to or for such bank or trust company as shall be designated by
Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"),
in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, as needed for
exchange and payment in accordance with this Section 1.07 through the Exchange
Agent, certificates evidencing the Guarantor Common Shares issuable pursuant to
Section 1.06(a), the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares in exchange
for outstanding Shares pursuant to Section 1.06(f) and the cash or other
property in respect of any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 1.07(c).

      (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify), and (ii) instructions to effect the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the certificates evidencing Guarantor Common Shares and cash in
lieu of fractional shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other customary documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
solely (A) certificates evidencing that number of whole Guarantor Common Shares
which such holder has the right to receive in accordance with Section 1.06(a) in
respect of the Shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate and (B) cash in
respect of fractional shares as provided in Section 1.06(f) (the Guarantor
Common Shares and cash in respect of fractional shares being referred to,
collectively, as the "Merger Consideration"), except that Shares held at the
Effective Time in book-entry form shall be exchanged for Merger Consideration in
accordance with the customary procedures of the Depository Trust Company.

                                       9
<PAGE>

      The holder of each Certificate, upon its exchange for Guarantor Common
Shares, shall also receive any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.07(c). Certificates surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled following the Effective Time. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration, dividends and
distributions may be issued and paid in accordance with this Article I to a
transferee if the Certificate evidencing such Shares is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer pursuant to this Section 1.07(b) and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until so surrendered, each
outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented Shares
will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes,
other than the payment of dividends or other distributions, to evidence the
ownership of the number of full Guarantor Common Shares, and cash in respect of
fractional shares, into which such Shares shall have been so converted.

      (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Guarantor Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
Guarantor Common Shares such holder is entitled to receive until the holder of
such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with the
provisions of Section 1.07(b). Subject to applicable law, following surrender of
any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificates representing whole Guarantor Common Shares issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole Guarantor Common Shares.

      (d) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for Guarantor Common Shares
is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered
in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange shall have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for Guarantor
Common Shares in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or establish to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

      (e) Escheat. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company nor any of their
respective affiliates shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for
any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

      (f) Withholding Rights. The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, and from any cash dividends or
other distributions that the holder is entitled to receive under Section
1.07(c), such amounts as the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or non-United States tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Exchange Agent, such portion of the Merger Consideration and
other such amounts payable under Section 1.07(c) that are withheld shall be
treated for all purposes of this

                                      10
<PAGE>

Agreement as having been received by the holder of the Shares in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent.

      (g) Undistributed Certificates. Any portion of the certificates evidencing
the Guarantor Common Shares, the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares
and the cash or other property in respect of dividends or other distributions
supplied to the Exchange Agent which remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore
complied with this Section 1.07 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment
of their claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with
respect to Guarantor Common Shares.

      Section 1.08 Stock Transfer Books. At the close of business on the date of
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Company Common Stock
thereafter on the records of the Company.

      Section 1.09 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The
Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange of Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

      Section 1.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions as may be required
pursuant to this Article I; provided, however, that Parent may, in its
                            --------  -------
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such
sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Guarantor, Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

      Section 1.11 Tax Consequences. It is intended by the parties hereto that
the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. The parties hereto hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the
United States Treasury Regulations.

      Section 1.12 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company will take, and cause their affiliates to take, all
such reasonable and lawful actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order
to effectuate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with this Agreement as promptly as possible. If, at any
time after the Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of

                                      11
<PAGE>

the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Company and Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time are fully authorized in the name of
their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such
lawful and necessary action.

                                  ARTICLE II

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY
                 ---------------------------------------------

      The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

      Section 2.01 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries; Material
Adverse Effect.

      (a) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is an entity duly organized,
validly existing and (to the extent the concept of good standing exists in the
applicable jurisdiction) in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization and has the requisite corporate or other power and authority
necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own, operate
or lease and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where
the failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to have such
power or authority would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed
as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, leased or operated by
it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except for such failures to be so duly qualified or licensed and in
good standing that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. A list of all subsidiaries of the Company together with the jurisdiction
of organization of each such subsidiary and the percentage of each such
subsidiary's outstanding capital stock owned by the Company or another
subsidiary of the Company (in the case of any non-U.S. subsidiaries, without
giving effect to any qualifying share ownerships of less than 1%) is contained
in Section 2.01 of the written disclosure schedule previously delivered by the
Company to the Parent (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"). Except as set forth
in Section 2.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Company SEC Documents,
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any
equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable
or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in, any corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity (other than
its wholly-owned subsidiaries), with respect to which interest the Company or a
subsidiary has invested (and currently owns) or is required to invest $500,000
or more, excluding securities in any publicly-traded company held for investment
by the Company and comprising less than five-percent of the outstanding stock of
such company.

      (b) When used in connection with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, the term "Material
Adverse Effect" means any change, effect or circumstance that is materially
adverse to the business, assets (including intangible assets), financial
condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries or
Guarantor and its subsidiaries, as the case may be, in each case taken as a
whole; provided, however, that the following shall be excluded from the
       --------  -------
definition of Material Adverse

                                      12
<PAGE>

Effect and from any determination as to whether a Material Adverse Effect has
occurred or may occur: changes, effects or circumstances, that are applicable to
(A) the health and safety and aviation industries generally, (B) the United
States securities markets generally, (C) personnel and other changes customarily
attendant to transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement and (D)
changes in economic, regulatory or political conditions generally.

      (c) The failure of a representation or warranty to be true and correct,
either individually or together with the failure of other representations or
warranties to be true and correct, or the failure to perform an obligation,
agreement or covenant shall be deemed to have a Material Adverse Effect if (x)
the business, assets (including intangible assets), financial condition or
results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, or of Guarantor and
its subsidiaries, as the case may be, in each case taken as a whole, are
materially worse than if such representation or warranty had been true and
correct or such obligation, agreement or covenant had been performed, excluding,
however, the effects of the changes specified in the proviso set forth in
Section 2.01(b), (y) in the case of the Company, such representation or warranty
materially misstates the capitalization of the Company and/or its subsidiaries
or (z) the failure of such representation or warranty to be true and correct or
the failure to perform such obligation, agreement or covenant materially and
adversely affects the ability of the Company or Parent, Merger Sub and Guarantor
as the case may be, timely to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, in the case of Guarantor, the Guarantee.

      Section 2.02 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws. The Company has
heretofore made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of its Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws, each
as amended to date (the "Company Charter Documents"), and will make available to
Parent, as promptly as practicable, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws
(or equivalent organizational documents) of each of its subsidiaries reasonably
requested by Parent (the "Subsidiary Documents"). All such Company Charter
Documents and Subsidiary Documents are in full force and effect, except in the
case of Subsidiary Documents where the failure to be in full force and effect
would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries
is in violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or
By-laws or equivalent organizational documents, except for violations of the
documents which do not and are not reasonably likely to materially interfere
with the operations of such entity.

      Section 2.03 Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 36,000,000 shares of the Company Common Stock and 3,217,495 shares
of Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value per share (the "Company Preferred Stock"),
of which 500,000 shares have been designated Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Shares (the "Company Series A Preferred Stock"). As of February 1,
2001, (i) 16,964,518 shares of the Company Common Stock were issued and
outstanding, all of which are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable (excluding treasury shares which are issued but not outstanding,
all of which are not entitled to vote) and none of which were issued in
violation of preemptive or similar rights, (ii) no shares of the Company Common
Stock were held by subsidiaries of the Company, (iii) 1,457,501 shares of the
Company Common Stock were reserved for existing grants and 937,092 shares were
reserved for future grants pursuant to the Company Option Plans, (iv) no shares
of the Company Common Stock were reserved and available for future issuance
pursuant

                                      13
<PAGE>

to the Company ESPP and the Company's 401(k) plans. There are no outstanding
shares of Company Preferred Stock (including shares of Company Series A
Preferred Stock). Except as set forth in Section 2.03 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no change in such capitalization has occurred since February 1, 2001,
except for changes resulting from the exercise or termination of Company Stock
Options. Except as set forth in Section 2.01, this Section 2.03 or Section 2.11
or in Section 2.03 or Section 2.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the
Company SEC Documents, there are no options, warrants or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character (including, without
limitation, registration rights) binding on the Company or any of its
subsidiaries relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, to issue, sell or register any shares of capital stock
of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any of its subsidiaries. All
shares of the Company Common Stock subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon
issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to
which they are issuable, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully-paid
and nonassessable.

      Except as set forth in Section 2.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or
the reports, schedules, forms, statements, registration statements, proxy
statements and other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") since December 31, 1999 and prior to the date of
this Agreement, including those incorporated therein by reference (the "Company
SEC Documents"), there are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any shares of the Company Common Stock or the capital stock of any subsidiary.
Except as set forth in Section 2.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the
Company SEC Documents, there are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to provide funds to or make any investment
(in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any such
subsidiary or any other entity other than guarantees of bank obligations of
subsidiaries entered into in the ordinary course of business. Except as set
forth in Section 2.01 or 2.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock (other than directors' qualifying shares) of
each of the Company's subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully-
paid and nonassessable, and all such shares (other than directors' qualifying
shares and a de minimis number of shares owned by employees of such
subsidiaries) are owned by the Company or another subsidiary free and clear of
all security interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in the
Company's voting rights, charges or other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.

      Section 2.04  Authority Relative to This Agreement.

      (a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the

Documents and the filings and recording of appropriate merger documents as

Stockholders Meeting"). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and/or the
Guarantee hereof, as applicable, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms.

      Section 2.05 Material Contracts; No Conflict; Required Filings and

the ordinary course of business and involving, in the case of any such contract,
agreement, commitment, or other understanding or arrangement, individual
payments or receipts by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of less than
$2,000,000 over the term of such contract, commitment, agreement, or other
understanding or arrangement; and (iii) all agreements which are required to be
filed as "material contracts" with the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the

the ordinary course of business and licensing or royalty arrangements, the
threshold referred to in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence shall be measured
on an annual basis.

      (b) Except as set forth in Section 2.05(b) of the Company Disclosure

and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, (i) conflict with
or violate the Company Charter Documents, (ii) conflict with or violate the
Subsidiary Documents or any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree

subsidiaries' rights or alter the

                                      15
<PAGE>

rights or obligations of any third party under, or give to others any rights of,

purchase) any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, credit facility,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or any of their respective
properties is bound or affected, except, in the case of clause (ii) or (iii),
for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

      (c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not,
and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any governmental, administrative or regulatory authority, U.S. and non-U.S.
(each, a "Governmental Authority"), except (i) for applicable requirements, if
any, of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of
the SEC thereunder (the "Securities Act"), the Exchange Act, state securities
laws, the pre-merger notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations
thereunder (the "HSR Act"), the Nasdaq Stock Market ("NASDAQ") and the NYSE;
filings and consents under any applicable non-United States laws intended to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade ("Non-U.S. Monopoly Laws"); filings and
consents as may be required under any environmental, health or safety law or
regulation pertaining to any notification, disclosure or required approval
triggered by the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
("Environmental, Health and Safety Laws"); and the filing and recordation of
appropriate merger or other documents as required by the DGCL, (ii) where the
failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to
make such filings or notifications, would not prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Merger, or otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company
from performing its material obligations under this Agreement, or would not
otherwise reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) as to which any necessary consents, approvals,
authorizations, permits, filings or notifications have heretofore been obtained
or filed, as the case may be, by the Company.

      Section 2.06 Compliance; Permits. (a) Except as set forth in Section
2.06(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Company SEC Documents, neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is, or has been, as a result of which it
could reasonably be expected now or in the future to have liability, in conflict
with, or in default or violation of, (i) any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment or decree applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or by
which its or any of their respective properties is bound or affected or (ii) any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
its or any of their respective properties is bound or affected, except for any
such conflicts, defaults or violations which would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the
Company's knowledge, no investigation by any Governmental Authority with respect
to the Company or any of its subsidiaries is pending or threatened, except as
disclosed in the Company SEC Documents.

                                      16
<PAGE>

      (b) Except as set forth in Section 2.06(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Company SEC Documents, the Company and its subsidiaries hold all
permits, licenses, easements, variances, exemptions, consents, certificates,
orders and approvals from governmental authorities which are material to the
operation of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
as it is now being conducted (collectively, the "Company Permits"), except where
the failure to hold such Company Permits would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company
and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Company Permits,
and have not failed to comply therewith as a result of which they would
reasonably be expected to have liability now or in the future, except as
described in the Company SEC Documents or where the failure to so comply would
not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

      Section 2.07 SEC Filings; Financial Statements. (a) The Company has filed
all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including all
exhibits to the Company SEC Documents) required to be filed with the SEC since
December 31, 1997 (the "Post-1997 Company SEC Documents"). Except as disclosed
in Section 2.07 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Company SEC Documents,
such reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (i) complied in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not at the time they were
filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this

the Company not to perform its covenants hereunder.

      Section 4.02 No Solicitation.

      (a) The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, through any officer,
director, employee, representative or agent of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, solicit or encourage the initiation of (including by way of
furnishing information) any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, sale of
assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including, without limitation, by way
of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving the Company or any
subsidiaries of the Company that if consummated would constitute an Alternative
Transaction (as defined below) (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals
being referred to herein as an "Acquisition Proposal"). Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company, at any time
prior to the adoption of this Agreement at the Company's Stockholders Meeting,
from (i) furnishing information to a third party which has made a bona fide
                                                                  ---- ----
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in
good faith after consulting with a nationally recognized investment banking firm
would, if consummated, constitute a Superior Proposal (as defined below) not
solicited in violation of this Agreement, provided that such third party has,
prior to its receipt of such information, executed an agreement with
confidentiality provisions no less favorable (taken as a whole) to the Company
than those then in effect between the Company and a subsidiary of Guarantor or
(ii) subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 4.02, including
Sections 4.02(c) and (d), considering and

                                      38
<PAGE>

negotiating a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the
Company concludes in good faith after consulting with a nationally recognized
investment banking firm would, if consummated, constitute a Superior Proposal
not solicited in violation of this Agreement; provided, however, that, as to
                                              --------  -------
each of clauses (i) and (ii), the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably
determines in good faith (after due consultation with independent counsel, which
may be Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP) that it is or is reasonably likely to be
required to do so in order to discharge properly its fiduciary duties.

      For purposes of this Agreement, "Alternative Transaction" means any of (i)
a transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than
Parent or its affiliates (a "Third Party") acquires or would acquire more than
25% of the outstanding shares of any class of equity securities of the Company,
whether from the Company or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or
otherwise, (ii) a merger or other business combination involving the Company
pursuant to which any Third Party acquires or would acquire more than 25% of the
outstanding equity securities of the Company or the entity surviving such merger
or business combination, (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any Third Party
acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the
outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of the Company and securities of
the entity surviving any merger or business combination including any of the
Company's subsidiaries) of the Company, or any of its subsidiaries having a fair
market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in good
faith) equal to more than 25% of the fair market value of all the assets of the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such
transaction, or (iv) any other consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company or any significant
subsidiary of the Company, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that the term Alternative Transaction shall not
           --------- -------
include any acquisition of securities by a broker dealer in connection with a
bona fide public offering of such securities.

      For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any proposal
made by a Third Party to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration
consisting of cash and/or marketable securities, all of the Company Common Stock
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or all or substantially
all the assets of the Company, on terms which the Board of Directors of the
Company reasonably believes (after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable from a financial point of
view to its stockholders than the Merger Consideration taking into account at
the time of determination any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent; provided, however, that a Superior Proposal may be subject
                    --------- -------
to a due diligence review of confidential information and to other customary
conditions (other than financing conditions), including by way of example, those
contained herein.

      (b) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than
24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any modification of or
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information
relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of the
Company or any subsidiary by any person or entity that informs the Board of
Directors of the Company or such subsidiary that it is considering making, or
has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to Parent shall be made orally
and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making the
Acquisition Proposal or intending to make an

                                      39
<PAGE>

Acquisition Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to the books
and records of the Company, the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or
modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal, and whether the Company is
providing or intends to provide the person making the Acquisition Proposal with
access to information concerning the Company as provided in Section 4.02(a). The
Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of any material
changes in the status and any material changes or modifications in the material
terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall
also promptly notify Parent, orally and in writing, if it enters into
negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal.

      (c) Except to the extent the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably
determines in good faith (after due consultation with independent counsel, which
may be Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP ) that it is or is reasonably likely to be
required to act to the contrary in order to discharge properly its fiduciary
duties (and, with respect to the approval, recommendation or entering into of
any Acquisition Proposal, it may take such contrary action only after the second
full business day following Parent's and Merger Sub's receipt of written notice
of the Board of Directors' intention to do so), neither the Company nor the
Board of Directors of the Company shall withdraw or modify, or publicly propose
to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the adoption
by such Board of Directors of this Agreement or its approval of the Merger.

      (d) The Company and the Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i)
redeem the rights (the "Rights") issued under the Rights Agreement, dated as of
December 15, 1998, as amended, between the Company and National City Bank, as
Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement"), or waive or amend any provision of the
Rights Agreement, in any such case to permit or facilitate the consummation of
any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction, or (ii) enter into any
agreement with respect to (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into
not in violation of Section 4.02(a)), or otherwise approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative
Transaction, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms. It is understood and agreed that a deferral of the distribution of Rights
following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer shall not be
prohibited hereunder.

      (e) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to its
stockholders required by applicable law, rule or regulation or by NASDAQ.

      (f) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Parent and
Merger Sub) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. The
Company agrees not to release any third party from the confidentiality and
standstill provisions of any agreement to which the Company is a party, other
than agreements with the Company's customers and suppliers entered into in the
ordinary course of business.

      (g) The Company shall ensure that the officers and directors of the
Company and the Company subsidiaries and any investment banker or other advisor
or representative

                                      40
<PAGE>

retained by the Company, or providing services to the Company, in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby are aware of the restrictions
described in this Section 4.02. It is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 4.02 by any officer or director of the
Company or the Company subsidiaries and any investment banker, attorney or other
advisor or representative of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 4.02 by the Company.

      Section 4.03 Conduct of Business by Guarantor. During the period from the
date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement or the Effective Time, Parent covenants and agrees that, unless
the Company shall otherwise agree in writing, Parent shall take all action
necessary so that (i) Guarantor shall conduct its business, and cause the
businesses of its subsidiaries to be conducted, in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with past practice, including actions taken by Guarantor
or its subsidiaries in contemplation of consummation of the Merger or other
business acquisitions, and (ii) Guarantor shall not directly or indirectly do,
or propose to do, any of the following without the prior written consent of the
Company:

      (a) amend or otherwise change the Guarantor Charter Documents, except as
proposed in Guarantor's proxy statement for its 2001 annual general meeting of
shareholders filed with the SEC on January 29, 2001;

      (b) acquire or agree to acquire, by merging or consolidating with, by
purchasing an equity interest in or a portion of the assets of, or by any other
manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or other
business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to
acquire any assets of any other person, or dispose of any assets, which, in any
such case, would, or would reasonably be expected to, materially delay or
prevent the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;

      (c) declare, set aside, make or pay any dividend or other distribution
(whether in cash, stock or property or any combination thereof) in respect of
any of its capital stock, except that a wholly owned subsidiary of Guarantor may
declare and pay a dividend to its parent, and except that Guarantor may declare
and pay quarterly cash dividends on the Guarantor Common Shares of up to $0.0125
per share consistent with past practice;

      (d) take any action to change its accounting policies or procedures
(including, without limitation, procedures with respect to revenue recognition,
payments of accounts payable and collection of accounts receivable), except as
required by a change in GAAP occurring after the date hereof; or

      (e) take or agree in writing or otherwise to take any of the actions
described in Sections 4.03(a) through (d) above, or any action that would make
any of the representations or warranties of Parent contained in this Agreement
untrue or incorrect or prevent Parent from performing or cause Parent not to
perform its covenants hereunder.

Agreement, the Company shall, and Parent shall cause Guarantor to, prepare and
file with the SEC, preliminary proxy materials which shall constitute the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and, if the parties so agree at the time, the Registration
Statement.  As promptly as reasonably practicable after comments are received
from the SEC thereon and after the furnishing by the Company and Guarantor of
all information required to be contained therein, the Company shall, and Parent
shall, and shall cause Guarantor to, file with the SEC, the definitive Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement (or, if the Registration

adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders as set forth in Section
2.04(c) and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and to the payment of
the Merger Consideration in the form of Guarantor Common Shares pursuant to this
Agreement, and shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to become effective, and the Company shall mail the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to its stockholders as soon thereafter as reasonably
practicable. Parent shall also cause Guarantor to take any action (other than
qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified or to file a general consent to service of process) required to be
taken under the applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance
of Guarantor Common Shares in connection with the Merger, and the Company shall
furnish to Guarantor all information concerning the Company and the holders of
capital stock of the Company as may be reasonably requested in connection with
any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

     No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence to the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by the
Company or Guarantor, without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment thereon. Parent will advise the Company, promptly after
Guarantor receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement

Proxy Statement/Prospectus or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information.

     If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors,
should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to either of the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not

                                      42

other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

     (b) Parent shall cause Guarantor to include as an exhibit to the

and to the Company, on the basis of customary facts, representations,
warranties, covenants and assumptions set forth in such opinions, that the
Merger will be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code that is not
subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.367(a)-(3)(c) (other than with respect to Company stockholders who are or will
be "five-percent transferee stockholders" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)), and that each of Guarantor, Parent and
the Company will be a party to the reorganization within the meaning of Section

Section 5.02, the Company shall not be obligated to take the action set forth in
the preceding sentence of this Section 5.01(c) or to take the actions set forth
in the second sentence of Section 5.02 to the extent that the Board of Directors
of the Company determines (after due consultation with independent counsel,
which may be Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP) that such action is, or it is
reasonably likely that such action is, inconsistent with the proper discharge of
its fiduciary duties.

     Section 5.02 Company Stockholders Meeting.The Company shall establish a
record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable for the purpose of voting upon
the adoption of this Agreement, and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Company's
stockholders and to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act. The Company shall solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor
of adoption of this Agreement and shall take all other reasonable action
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of stockholders in favor of
such adoption.

     Section 5.03 Access to Information; Confidentiality. Upon reasonable notice
and subject to restrictions contained in confidentiality agreements (from which
such party shall use reasonable efforts to be released), the Company shall (and
shall cause its subsidiaries to) and Parent shall take all action necessary such
that Guarantor and its subsidiaries shall (i) afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives of the other, reasonable access,
during the period after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior
to the Effective Time, to the properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records of the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, and, (ii) during such
period, furnish promptly to the other all information concerning the business,
properties and personnel of the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, as such
other party may reasonably request, and each shall make available to the other

professionals) for

<PAGE>

discussion of the Company's or Guarantor's, as applicable, business, properties
and personnel as either Parent or the Company may reasonably request. Such
information shall be kept confidential in accordance with the terms of the
confidentiality agreement, dated September 5, 2000 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), between an affiliate of Guarantor and the Company.

     Section 5.04 Consents; Approvals.

     (a) Subject to Section 5.08, the Company and Parent shall each use its
reasonable best efforts (and Parent shall cause Guarantor to use its reasonable
best efforts) to obtain and to cooperate with each other in order to obtain all
consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders (including, without
limitation, all United States and non-United States governmental and regulatory
rulings and approvals), and the Company and Parent shall make (and Parent shall
cause Guarantor to make) all filings (including, without limitation, all filings
with United States and non-United States governmental or regulatory agencies)
required in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company and Parent and the consummation by them of the
transactions contemplated hereby.  The Company and Parent shall furnish (and
Parent shall cause Guarantor to furnish) all information required to be included
in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement, or for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of
any United States or non-United States governmental body in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     (b) The Company shall, and Parent shall and shall cause Guarantor to,
notify the other promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff or any other government officials in connection with any filing made
pursuant hereto and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials for amendments or supplements to the Registration
Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any other filings or for additional
information and will supply the other with copies of all correspondence between
such party or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its
staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the
Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Merger or any other
filing.  The Company shall, and Parent shall and shall cause Guarantor to, cause
all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory
authorities under Section 5.01 and this Section 5.04 to comply in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of law and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder.  Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any other filing, the Company will, or Parent will cause
Guarantor to, as the case may be, promptly inform the other of such occurrence
and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any other government
officials and/or mailing to stockholders of the Company, such amendment or
supplement.

     Section 5.05 Agreements with Respect to Affiliates. The Company shall
deliver to Parent, prior to the date the Registration Statement becomes
effective under the Securities Act, a letter identifying all persons who, at the
Effective Time, are anticipated to be "affiliates" of the Company for purposes
of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each person who is identified as an "affiliate" in the
Affiliate Letter to deliver to Parent prior to the Effective Time a written
agreement in connection with

                                      44
<PAGE>

restrictions on affiliates under Rule 145 under the Securities Act in a form
mutually agreeable to the Company and Parent.

     Section 5.06 Indemnification and Insurance.

     (a) The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification set
forth in the Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be amended,
modified or otherwise repealed for a period of six years from the Effective Time
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder as of the
Effective Time of individuals who at the Effective Time were directors or
officers of the Company, unless such modification is required after the
Effective Time by law and then only to the minimum extent required by such law.

     (b) The Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law or under the Surviving Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation
or By-laws, indemnify and hold harmless, each present and former director or
officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, (x)
arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or (y) otherwise with respect to any acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, to the same extent as provided in the Company Charter
Documents or any applicable contract or agreement as in effect on the date
hereof, in each case for a period of six years after the Effective Time. In the
event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) any counsel retained by the
Indemnified Parties for any period after the Effective Time (which may be
Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP or otherwise) shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Surviving Corporation, (ii) after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, promptly
after statements therefor are received, provided that the Indemnified Parties
shall be required to reimburse the Surviving Corporation for such payments in
the circumstances and to the extent required by the Company Charter Documents,
any applicable contract or agreement with such Indemnified Party or applicable
law, and (iii) the Surviving Corporation will cooperate in the defense of any
such matter; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
             --------- -------
liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld); and provided further that, in the event
                                         -------- -------
that any claim or claims for indemnification are asserted or made within such
six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or
claims shall continue until the final disposition of any and all such claims.
The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent
them in each applicable jurisdiction with respect to any single action unless
there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties,
in which case each Indemnified Person with respect to whom such a conflict
exists (or group of such Indemnified Persons who among them have no such
conflict) may retain one separate law firm in each applicable jurisdiction.

      (c) The Surviving Corporation shall honor and fulfill in all respects the
obligations of the Company pursuant to indemnification agreements and employment
agreements

                                      45
<PAGE>

(the parties under such agreements being referred to as the "Covered Persons")
with the Company's directors and officers existing at or before the Effective
Time, provided such agreements do not violate Section 4.01(f).

      (d) In addition, Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide, for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time,
the Company's current directors and officers (as defined to mean those persons
insured under such policy) with an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the
"D&O Insurance") that is no less favorable than the existing policy or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available
coverage; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
          --------  -------
be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of 200% of
the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance, but in such
case shall purchase as much such coverage as possible for such amount.

      (e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall unconditionally
guarantee the timely payment of all funds owing by, and the timely performance
of all other obligations of, the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.06.

      (f) This Section shall survive the consummation of the Merger at the
Effective Time, is intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
the Indemnified Parties and the Covered Persons, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and shall be enforceable by
the Indemnified Parties and the Covered Persons.

      Section 5.07 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of
(i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence
of which would reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement to be materially untrue or inaccurate, or (ii) any
failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, materially to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice
                              --------  -------
pursuant to this Section shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice; and provided further
                                                            -------- -------
that failure to give such notice shall not be treated as a breach of covenant
for the purposes of Section 7.01(h) unless and except to the extent that the
failure to give such notice results in material prejudice to the other party.

      Section 5.08 Further Action/Tax Treatment.

      (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the
parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to, and Parent shall cause
Guarantor to use all reasonable efforts to, take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to obtain in a timely manner all
necessary waivers, consents and approvals and to effect all necessary
registrations and filings, and otherwise to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all
conditions precedent to its obligations under this Agreement. The foregoing
covenant shall include the obligation by Guarantor to agree to divest, abandon,
license, hold separate or take similar action with respect to any assets
(tangible or intangible)

                                      46
<PAGE>

which are not material to Guarantor or the Company (but shall not include any
obligation by Guarantor to agree to divest, abandon, license, hold separate or
take similar action with respect to any material assets (tangible or intangible)
of Guarantor or the Company). For this purpose, assets shall be deemed not to be
material to the Company, only if they account for no more than 5% of the total
revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or to Guarantor,
only if they account for no more than 0.3% of the total revenues of Guarantor's
Fire and Security Group.

      (b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and Parent shall
cause Guarantor to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to
qualify, and will not (both before and after the Effective Time) take any
actions, or fail to take any action, which could reasonably be expected to
prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a reorganization under the provisions of
Section 368(a) of the Code that is not subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-(3)(c) (other than with respect
to Company stockholders who are or will be "five-percent transferee
stockholders" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-
3(c)(5)(ii)). Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
Guarantor to, report, to the extent required by the Code or the regulations
thereunder, the Merger for income tax purposes as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368 of the Code. Each of Parent and the Company shall make,
and shall cause their affiliates to make, such representations, warranties and
covenants as shall be requested reasonably in the circumstances by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP in order for such
firms to render their opinions referred to in Section 5.01(b).

      Section 5.09 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing (and in the case of Parent, before Guarantor
issues) any press release or making any written public statement with respect to
the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make
any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that either party may,
                                    --------  -------
without the prior consent of the other, issue such press release or make such
public statement as may upon the advice of counsel be required by law or the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC (including, without limitation,
Rules 165 and 425 under the Securities Act and Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange
Act), NYSE or NASDAQ if it has used all reasonable efforts to consult with the
other party.

      Section 5.10 Guarantor Common Shares.

      (a) Parent shall obtain from Guarantor, and shall cause Guarantor to
transfer to Parent, the Guarantor Common Shares to be delivered by Parent to the
holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger.

      (b) Parent shall cause Guarantor to use its best efforts to cause the
Guarantor Common Shares to be delivered by Parent to the holders of Company
Common Stock in the Merger to be listed, upon official notice of issuance, on
the NYSE prior to the Effective Time.

      (c) Parent shall cause Guarantor on a timely basis to take any action
required to be taken under non-U.S. securities laws in connection with the
issuance of Guarantor Common Shares in the Merger.

                                      47
<PAGE>

      Section 5.11 Stock Options and ESPP. (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the holders thereof,
with respect to each outstanding Company Stock Option, the terms of which permit
the Company, upon full exercisability, to terminate such Stock Option as of the
Effective Time (each such Company Stock Option, a "Cash-Out Option"), the Board
of Directors of the Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall cause
such Cash-Out Option to (i) become exercisable in full as of or immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) expire as of the Effective Time, and to
thereby constitute the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the positive
difference, if any, between (A) the product of the Exchange Ratio and the
Average Share Price, multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock
for which the Cash-Out Option was exercisable as of or immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (B) the aggregate exercise price for the Company Common Stock
purchasable pursuant to such Cash-Out Option. Any Cash-Out Option, the exercise
price of which as of the Effective Time equals or exceeds the amount equal to
the product of the Exchange Ratio and the Average Share Price, shall be
cancelled and be of no further force and effect as of the Effective Time.

      (b) At the Effective Time, and subject to the last sentence of this
Section 5.11(b), Parent shall take all necessary action to provide that each
outstanding Company Stock Option under the Company's Director's Stock Option
Plan and any other Company Stock Options the terms of which do not permit the
Company to terminate such Company Stock Option as of or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable, will continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the relevant Company
Stock Option Plan and applicable award agreement (and separation agreement, if
applicable) immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that all
Company Stock Options, other than Company Stock Options granted after the date
hereof, shall be 100% vested and exercisable at the Effective Time, except that,
(i) each Company Stock Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in
accordance with its terms) for that number of whole Guarantor Common Shares
equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon exercise of such the Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole
number of Guarantor Common Shares and (ii) the per share exercise price for the
Guarantor Common Shares issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option will
be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of
the Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the
nearest whole cent (each such Company Stock Option, as modified, an "Adjusted
Option"). The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the holders of Company Stock Options
subject to this Section 5.11(b) that such Company Stock Options will be governed
by Section 5.11(a) and deemed a Cash-Out Option and not be deemed an Adjusted
Option.

      (c) Parent will cause Guarantor to take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Guarantor Common Shares for delivery
upon exercise of the Adjusted Options and, if and to the extent necessary to
deliver to holders of Adjusted Options upon the exercise of such options,
Guarantor Common Shares registered pursuant to the Securities Act and listed on
the NYSE. At the Effective Time, Parent will cause Guarantor to have a
sufficient number of Guarantor Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the
Adjusted Options registered pursuant to the Securities Act and listed on the
NYSE.

                                      48
<PAGE>

      (d) Beginning on the date hereof, the Company shall not establish any new
employee stock purchase plans or extend the availability of the Company ESPP to
any employees not previously included in the Company ESPP, or, in either case,
implement any decisions to do the same, whether or not such decisions have been
communicated to employees. The Company shall take such action as is necessary to
terminate such plans as of the Effective Time. All shares of Company Common
Stock under the Company ESPP shall be issued to participants in a manner such
that the shares will be treated as all other shares of Company Common Stock.

      Section 5.12 Certain Employee Benefits.

      (a) From the Effective Time through December 31, 2001 (the "Benefits
Continuation Period"), the Surviving Corporation shall provide each person who,
as of the Effective Time, is an employee of the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company (a "Company Employee") with employee benefits that are comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, provided, however, subject to applicable law and contractual
                --------  -------
restrictions, that the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to amend any
Company Employee Plans, including without limitation, any retiree welfare
benefit plans or pension benefit plans, in effect as of the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, from the Effective Time through the end of the
Benefits Continuation Period, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain severance
plans, policies and programs for the benefit of each Company employee that are
substantially comparable to the severance plans, policies and programs of the
Company as in effect for such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,
provided, however, that, except as required by contractual obligation, no such
--------  -------
employee shall be entitled to a severance benefit in excess of one year's salary
and one year's continuation of health and welfare benefits.

      (b) After the Benefits Continuation Period the Surviving Corporation shall
provide the Company Employees with employee benefits that are comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of subsidiaries of
the Guarantor. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that the Surviving
Corporation shall have no obligation to provide Company Employees with post-
termination welfare or pension benefits, except to the extent required by
applicable law or contractual agreement.

      (c) With respect to the benefits provided pursuant to this Section 5.12,
(i) service accrued by Company Employees during employment with the Company and
its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time shall be recognized for eligibility
and vesting and, except with respect to defined benefit plans, benefit accrual,
(ii) any and all pre-existing condition limitations (to the extent such
limitations did not apply to a pre-existing condition under the applicable
Company Employee Plan) and eligibility waiting periods under any group health
plan shall be waived with respect to such Company Employees and their eligible
dependents, and (iii) Company Employees shall be given credit for amounts paid
under a Company Employee Plan during the same period for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the employee welfare
plans maintained by the Surviving Corporation or the applicable subsidiary of
the Guarantor.

                                      49
<PAGE>

      (d) With respect to the Company's 1982 Deferred Compensation Plan, 1983
Deferred Compensation Plan, and Senior Executive Benefits Program (collectively
the "Deferred Compensation Plans") and any other non-qualified plan providing
employees with deferred compensation, the Board of Directors of the Company (or
the appropriate committee thereof) shall determine that the Merger will not
constitute a Forced Takeover and, with respect to the Deferred Compensation
Plans, (i) as of the Effective Time no further benefit accruals shall be made
under such plans and (ii) all accrued benefits under such plans shall be paid
pursuant to the terms thereof.

      (e) Except as provided in Sections 5.11(b) and 5.12(f), awards payable in
shares of Company Common Stock under any Company Employee Plan, program or
agreement not paid out or deferred prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted to an award payable in cash only, and Guarantor will be under no
obligation to issue any Guarantor Common Shares pursuant to any Company Employee
Plan, program or agreement after the Effective Time.

      (f) The Company shall amend the Scott Technologies, Inc. 401(k) Savings
Plan for Salaried Employees, the Scott Technologies, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan
for Hourly Paid Employees, the Scott Technologies, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan for
Bargaining Unit Employees, and the Av-Ox 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan, where
necessary, to preclude any additional purchases of stock of the Company, as of
the date 2 days prior to the Effective Time, and the Company shall communicate
this amendment to the participants in such plans.

      (g) It is expressly agreed that (i) the provisions of Section 5.12 are not
intended to be for the benefit of or otherwise enforceable by any third party,
including, without limitation, any Company Employees and (ii) except as provided
in Section 5.12(a), nothing herein shall prevent the Surviving Corporation or
any other subsidiary of Guarantor from amending or modifying any employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement in any respect or terminating or modifying
the terms and conditions of employment or other service of any particular
employee or any other person.

      Section 5.13 Accountants Letters. Upon reasonable notice from the other,
the Company shall use its best efforts to cause Arthur Andersen LLP to deliver
to Parent, and Parent shall use its best efforts to cause PricewaterhouseCoopers
to deliver to the Company, a letter covering such matters as are reasonably
requested by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and as are customarily
addressed in accountants' "comfort letters."

      Section 5.14 Compliance with State Property Transfer Statutes. The Company
agrees that it shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to comply promptly
with all requirements of applicable state property transfer laws as may be
required by the relevant state agency and shall take all action necessary to
cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be effected in compliance with
applicable state property transfer laws, except where the failure to so comply
will not materially affect the right to use or enjoy any applicable property
after the Effective Time. The Company, after consultation with Parent, shall
determine which actions must be taken prior to or after the Effective Time to
comply with applicable state property transfer laws. The Company agrees to
provide Parent with any documents required to be submitted to the relevant state
agency prior to submission, and the Company shall not take any action to comply
with applicable state property transfer laws without Parent's prior consent,

                                      50
<PAGE>

which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Parent shall
provide, and shall cause Guarantor to provide, to the Company any assistance
reasonably requested by the Company with respect to such compliance.

      Section 5.15 Conveyance Taxes. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in
the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications, or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees, and any similar taxes which become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby that are
required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time, and the
Company shall be responsible for the payment of all such taxes and fees. In no
event shall Parent or any affiliate thereof (other than a subsidiary of the
Company) reimburse the Company for the payment of such taxes and fees.

                                  ARTICLE VI

to the Effective Time under any Non-U.S. Monopoly Laws shall have been obtained,

respect to any Non-U.S. Monopoly Laws would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company, Guarantor or Guarantor's Fire and
Security Group;

      (d) Governmental Actions. There shall not have been instituted, pending or
threatened any action or proceeding (or any investigation or other inquiry that
is reasonably likely to result in such an action or proceeding) by any
Governmental Authority or before any Governmental Authority or court of
competent jurisdiction, United States or non-United States, that is reasonably

or order of any Governmental Authority or court of competent jurisdiction, or
any other legal restraint (i) preventing or seeking to prevent consummation of
the Merger, (ii) prohibiting or seeking to prohibit, or limiting or seeking to

each of them, on the basis of customary representations, warranties, covenants

within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code that is not subject to Section
367(a)(1) of the Code pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-(3)(c)
(other than with respect to Company stockholders who are or will be "five-

Effective Time, with the same force and effect as if made on and as of the
Effective Time, except for (i) changes contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
those representations and warranties which address matters only as of a
particular date (which shall have been true and correct as of such date, subject
to clause (iii)), or (iii) where the failure to be true and correct would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate with all other such
failures, to have a Material Adverse Effect, and Parent and Merger Sub shall
have received a certificate of the Company to such effect signed by the Chief
Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Company;

      (b) Agreements and Covenants. The Company shall have performed or complied
in all material respects with all agreements and covenants required by this

                                        --------  -------

authorizations or orders required to be obtained, and all filings required to be

Agreement and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby
shall have been obtained and made by the Company, except where the failure to

with all other such failures, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
Parent or Guarantor; and

is identified in the Affiliate Letter as an "affiliate" of the Company an

this Section 7.01(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to

Misrepresentation"); provided that if such Terminating Misrepresentation is
                     --------
curable prior to August 31, 2001 by the Company or Parent, as the case may be,

defined); provided that if any such Terminating Change is curable prior to

August 31, 2001 by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, through the
exercise of its reasonable best efforts, and for so long as the Company or

this Section 7.01(g); or

its affiliates, directors, officers or stockholders except that (i) the Company,

the foregoing, nothing herein shall relieve the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
from liability for any willful breach hereof or willful misrepresentation herein
(it being understood that (x) the provisions of Section 7.03 do not constitute a
sole or exclusive remedy for such willful breach or misrepresentation and (y)
the mere existence of a Material Adverse Effect, by itself, shall not constitute

date of this Agreement and ending 12 months following the date of termination of
this Agreement and such transaction shall at any time thereafter be consummated
on substantially the terms theretofore announced; provided, that in the case of
                                                  --------
Section 7.03(b)(i), such transaction provides for a per Share consideration with
a fair market value greater than $23.00; and provided further, that for purposes
                                             -------- -------
of this definition, the definition of Alternative Transaction set forth in

7.01(h), (i) the Company shall pay to Guarantor and Parent their respective
Expenses relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a

shall be paid within one business day after a demand for payment following the
first to occur of any of the events described in the aforesaid Sections, as
applicable; provided that, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
            --------
Fee or any Expenses to Parent, nor shall Parent be required to pay any Expenses
to the Company if, immediately prior to the termination of this Agreement, the
entity otherwise entitled to receive such fee and/or expenses was in material
breach of its obligations under this Agreement or, in the case of Parent, Merger
Sub was in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement or Guarantor
was in material breach of the Guarantee.

      (g) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that the payments
provided for in this Section 7.03 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and Merger Sub upon a termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.01(c), (e), (f), (h) or (i), and the payments provided for in this
Section 7.03 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company upon a
termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f) or (h),
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such termination; provided,

Agreement or any willful

misrepresentation hereunder giving rise to such termination. Subject to Section
7.03(f), if a party is entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to more
than one clause of Section 7.01, such party shall be entitled to receive the
Fees and Expenses to which it is entitled as a result of any such termination,
provided that in no event shall there be any duplication of payment.

and Covered Persons and may be enforced by such Indemnified Parties and Covered
Persons) and Section 7.03 (which contains provisions intended to be for the
benefit of Guarantor and may be enforced by Guarantor).

                                   GUARANTEE

      Tyco International Ltd. ("Guarantor") irrevocably guarantees each and
                                ---------
every representation, warranty, covenant, agreement and other obligation of
Parent and Merger Sub, and/or any of their respective permitted assigns (and
where any such representation or warranty is made to the knowledge of Parent or
Merger Sub, such representation or warranty shall be deemed made to the
knowledge of Guarantor), and the full and timely performance of their respective
obligations under the provisions of the foregoing Agreement. This is a guarantee
of payment and performance, and not of collection, and Guarantor acknowledges
and agrees that this guarantee is full and unconditional, and no release or
extinguishment of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations or liabilities (other
than in accordance with the terms of the Agreement), whether by decree in any
bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, shall affect the continuing validity and
enforceability of this guarantee, as well as any provision requiring or
contemplating performance by Guarantor.

      Guarantor hereby waives, for the benefit of the Company, (i) any right to
require the Company as a condition of payment or performance by Guarantor, to
proceed against Parent or Merger Sub or pursue any other remedy whatsoever and
(ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any defenses or benefits that may
be derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or exonerate
guarantors or sureties, except to the extent that any such defense is available
to Parent or Merger Sub.

      Without limiting in any way the foregoing guarantee, Guarantor covenants
and agrees to take all actions to enable Parent and Merger Sub to adhere to each
provision of the Agreement which requires an act or omission on the part of
Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries to enable Parent or Merger Sub to comply
with its obligations under the Agreement.

      The provisions of Article VIII of the Agreement are incorporated herein,
mutatis mutandis, except that notices and other communications hereunder to
Guarantor shall be delivered to Tyco International Ltd., The Zurich Centre,
Second Floor, 90 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM 08, Bermuda, Attn: Chief Corporate
Counsel, Telecopy No. (441) 295-9647, Confirm No. (441) 292-8674 (with a copy as
provided therefor in Section 8.02(a)).

      Guarantor understands that the Company is relying on this guarantee in
entering into the Agreement and may enforce this guarantee as if Guarantor were
a party thereto.

                                    TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD.
