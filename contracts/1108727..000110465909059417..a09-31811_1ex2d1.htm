THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of October
18, 2009, by and among SPRINT NEXTEL CORPORATION, a Kansas corporation ("
_Parent_ "), IRELAND ACQUISITION CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("
_Buyer_ ") and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and IPCS, INC., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ ").

  



  

W I T N E S S E T H:

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties to this Agreement desire to effect the acquisition of
the Company by Buyer;

  



  

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the foregoing, Parent shall cause Buyer to make a
tender offer to purchase for cash all the outstanding shares of common stock
of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Company Common Stock_ "),
at a price per share of Company Common Stock of $24.00 (such amount, or any
other higher amount per share of Company Common Stock paid pursuant to the
Offer and this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ ") subject to any required
withholding Taxes as described in Section 1.10(e) and without interest, on
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement (as it may be
amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_
");

  



  

WHEREAS, also in furtherance of the foregoing, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), following the consummation of the
Offer, Buyer shall merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") in
accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, with the Company as the surviving
corporation;

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to ParentÂ’s entering into this Agreement,
certain stockholders of the Company have entered into a stockholders
agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Stockholders Agreement_ "),
pursuant to which, among other things, such stockholders have agreed to
tender their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and to vote
their respective shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the Merger,
subject to the terms and conditions contained therein;

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to ParentÂ’s and the CompanyÂ’s entering into
this Agreement, Parent and the Company and certain of their respective
subsidiaries have entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release,
dated as of the date hereof (the " _Settlement Agreement_ "), pursuant to
which, among other things, the parties thereto have agreed to compromise and
settle certain claims among them, subject to the terms and conditions
contained therein;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously approved this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby
**,** which approval was based in part on (1) the opinion of UBS Securities
LLC (" _UBS_ "), an independent financial advisor to the Board of Directors
of the Company, that, based on the assumptions, qualifications and
limitations contained therein, the Offer Price to be received by the holders
of Company

        
   

  



  

Common Stock in the Offer is, as of the date of such opinion, fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders, and (2) the opinion of Morgan
Stanley and Co. Incorporated (" _Morgan Stanley_ " and, together with UBS, the
" _Independent Advisors_ "), an independent financial advisor to the Board of
Directors of the Company, that based on the assumptions, qualifications and
limitations contained therein, the consideration to be received by the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders for their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement is, as of the date of such opinion, fair, from a financial
point of view, to those stockholders; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined
that this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company
Stockholders_ "), (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
Settlement Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Offer and the Merger and (iii) recommended that the Company
Stockholders accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer and, to the extent applicable, adopt this Agreement and
approve the Merger.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree
as follows:

  



  

# **ARTICLE I 
  
  _THE OFFER AND THE MERGER_**

  

# ** **

  

## Section 1.1. _The Offer_.

  

### 

  

### (a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as promptly
as practicable but in no event later than October 28, 2009, Buyer shall,
and Parent shall cause Buyer to, commence the Offer within the meaning of
the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ "). The obligations of Buyer to, and of Parent to
cause Buyer to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common
Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the conditions
set forth in _Exhibit A_. The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be
the 20th business day following the commencement of the Offer (determined
using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the SEC). Buyer expressly reserves the right to
waive any condition to the Offer or modify the terms of the Offer, except
that, without the consent of the Company, Buyer shall not (i) reduce the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce
the Offer Price, (iii) amend or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv)
add to the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ or modify any condition set
forth in _Exhibit A_, (v) extend the Offer (except as set forth in the
following two sentences), (vi) change the form of consideration payable in
the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend or modify the Offer in any manner adverse
to the holders of Company Common Stock (it being agreed that a waiver by
Buyer of any condition, in its sole discretion, shall not be deemed to be
adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, but subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, Buyer
may, but shall not be obligated to, without the consent of the Company, (i)
extend the Offer if, at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer, any of
the conditions to BuyerÂ’s obligation to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock are not satisfied, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or
waived, in increments of not more than five business days

  



        
   

  



  

### each, (ii) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer and (iii) extend the Offer for a period of time not
to exceed ten business days if, at the scheduled expiration date of the
Offer, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have withdrawn, qualified
or modified, or proposed publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, its
approval or recommendation of the Offer or the Merger; _provided, however_
, that if at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer (A) the
only condition to BuyerÂ’s obligation to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock that is not satisfied is the condition set forth in clause (g) of
Exhibit A (the " _Outstanding Condition_ ") and (B) none of the matters set
forth in the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii) are applicable, then (x) Buyer
shall be permitted to extend the Offer for up to two additional five business
day periods (but in no event to a date later than the business day
immediately prior to the Outside Date) as contemplated by the foregoing
clause (i) (the last of such periods being, the " _Final Extension Period_ ")
in order to provide additional time for the Outstanding Condition to be
satisfied and (y) if the Outstanding Condition is not satisfied by the last
day of the Final Extension Period then (1) if so directed by Buyer, the
Company will abandon the license or authorization that is the subject of the
Outstanding Condition and (2) Buyer shall waive the Outstanding Condition and
consummate the Offer on the last day of the Final Extension Period (assuming
that all other conditions on _Exhibit A_ remain satisfied at such time).
In addition, if at the otherwise scheduled expiration date of the Offer
any condition to the Offer is not satisfied, Buyer shall, and Parent shall
cause Buyer to, extend the Offer at the request of the Company for such
periods as the Company may request; _provided_ that Parent and Buyer shall
not be obligated to extend the Offer beyond January 31, 2010 (the " _Outside
Date_ "), _provided_ _further_ that if on January 31, 2010, all of
the conditions set forth in Exhibit A are satisfied or waived other than
any condition set forth in clause (f) or clause (g) of Exhibit A, the

this Agreement, Buyer shall, and Parent shall cause Buyer to, accept for
payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and

moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect of banks or any material
limitation (whether or not mandatory) on the extension of credit by lending

until such time as such events no longer make it impracticable to consummate
the Offer. Buyer shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
expiration date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Article VII, Buyer shall, and Parent shall cause Buyer
to, promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of such termination) terminate
the Offer and shall not acquire any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
thereto. If the Offer is terminated by Buyer, or this Agreement is terminated
prior to the acquisition of shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer,
Buyer shall promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf
of Buyer to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered shares of
Company Common Stock that have not then been purchased in the Offer to the
registered holders thereof.

regulation, ordinance, code, order, judgment, decree or any other requirement
or rule of law. Each of Parent, Buyer and the Company shall promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and each of Parent and Buyer shall take all steps necessary
to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents
as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated
to the Company Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws and any other applicable Laws. The Company
and its counsel shall be given the opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents and any supplements or amendments thereto prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC and Parent and Buyer shall give due consideration to any
such comments proposed by the Company. Parent and Buyer shall provide the

their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments.

### (a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer, and on the date the Offer
Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall simultaneously file with
the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as amended from time to

to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in
each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws

stockholders, security position listings and computer files and all other
information in the CompanyÂ’s possession or control regarding the beneficial
owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Buyer such information
and assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request
in communicating the Offer to the Company Stockholders. Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Offer, Parent and Buyer shall, and shall cause their agents
to, hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings
and files, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and
the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request,
promptly deliver to the Company all copies of such information then in their
possession or under their control.

Section 1.3. _Directors_.

  



  

### (a) Promptly after the acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common
Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer representing at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on a fully diluted basis (the time
of such acceptance being, " _Appointment Time_ ") and, from time to time
thereafter, as shares of Company Common Stock are accepted for payment by
Buyer, Buyer shall be entitled to designate such number of members of the
Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Buyer Designees_ "), rounded up to
the nearest whole number, as will give Buyer representation on the Board of
Directors of the Company equal to the product of the total number of members
of the Board of Directors of the Company (after giving effect to any increase
in the number of the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied
by the percentage that the number of shares of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by Parent or Buyer at such time (including shares of
Company Common Stock so accepted for payment) bears to the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding. In furtherance thereof, the
Company shall, upon the request of, and as specified by, Buyer, promptly
either increase the size of the Board of Directors of the Company or secure
the resignations of such number of the CompanyÂ’s incumbent directors, or
both, as is necessary to enable Buyer Designees to be so elected or appointed
to the Board of Directors of the Company and the Company shall take all
actions available to the Company to cause Buyer Designees to be so elected or
appointed. At such time, if requested by Buyer, the Company shall also take
all action necessary to cause persons designated by Buyer to constitute at
least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the
Board of Directors of the Company of each committee of the Board of Directors
of the Company, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the rules of
any stock exchange or trading market on which the Company Common Stock is
listed and traded. The provisions of this Section 1.3 **** are in addition to
and shall

  



        
   

  



  

### not limit any rights which Buyer, Parent or any of their affiliates (as
such term is defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ")) may have as a holder or
beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock as a matter of applicable
Law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

  

### 

  

### (b) The CompanyÂ’s obligation to appoint the Buyer Designees to the Board
of Directors of the Company in accordance with Section 1.3(a) shall be
subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company shall take all
actions required in order to fulfill its obligations under Section 1.3(a),
including mailing to its stockholders the information required by Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder as part of
the Schedule 14D-9; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent and Buyer
shall supply to the Company in writing prior to the filing with the SEC of
the Schedule 14D-9 any information with respect to Parent and Buyer and
Buyer Designees to the extent required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

  

### 

  

### (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.3, the parties hereto
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that at least
two of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company shall, at all
times following the Appointment Time and prior to the Effective Time, be
directors of the Company who (i) were directors of the Company on the date
hereof, (ii) are not officers of the Company and (iii) are independent
directors for purposes of continuing listing requirements of NASDAQ (the "
_Continuing Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, if at any time there
shall be in office less than two Continuing Directors for any reason, the
Board of Directors of the Company shall cause the person meeting the
foregoing criteria and designated by the remaining Continuing Director to
fill such vacancy and such person shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director
for all purposes of this Agreement, or if no Continuing Directors then shall
remain, the other directors of the Company then in office shall designate two
persons meeting the foregoing criteria to fill such vacancies who will not be
directors, officers, employees or affiliates of Parent or Buyer and such
persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes of this
Agreement. From and after the time, if any, that Buyer Designees constitute a
majority of the Board of Directors of the Company and prior to the Effective
Time, subject to the terms hereof, any amendment or modification of this
Agreement, any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any extension of
time for performance of any of the obligations of Parent or Buyer hereunder,
any waiver of any condition to the CompanyÂ’s obligations hereunder or any of
the CompanyÂ’s rights hereunder and any other action of the Company hereunder
which adversely affects the Company Stockholders (other than Parent or Buyer)
may be effected only if (in addition to the approval of the Board of
Directors of the Company as a whole) there are in office one or more
Continuing Directors and such action is approved by a majority of the
Continuing Directors then in office. Following the Appointment Time and prior
to the Effective Time, neither Parent nor Buyer shall take any other action
to remove any Continuing Director.

## Section 1.4. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Buyer
shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Buyer shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation following the Merger (the " _Surviving

## Section 1.5. _Effective Time; Closing_. As promptly as practicable (and in
any event within five business days) after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions which by
their terms can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), the parties shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger or a
certificate of ownership and merger, as applicable (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ "), with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and by
making all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in connection
with the Merger, in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of, the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such other time (but not
earlier than the time that the Certificate of Merger is filed) as the parties
agree shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the
Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective Time_ ").  On the date of such
filing, a closing (the " _Closing_ ") shall be held at 10:00 a.m. Eastern

Georgia 30309, or at such other time and location as the parties shall
otherwise agree.

liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Company and Buyer shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,

1.7:

  

## 

  

### (a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant to Section
1.7(b) and Dissenting Shares, if any) shall be canceled and, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive the Offer Price (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), subject to any required withholding Taxes as
described in Section 1.10(e) and without interest, payable to the holder of
such share of Company Common Stock, upon surrender of the certificate
that formerly evidenced such share of Company Common Stock in the manner
provided in Section 1.10;

  

### 

  

### (b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent or Buyer and each share
of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company as treasury stock shall
be canceled and retired and cease to exist and no payment or distribution
shall be made with respect thereto;

  

### 

  

### (c) All shares of the Company Common Stock converted pursuant to Section
1.7(a) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (" _Certificate_
") 

  



        
   

  



  

### representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 1.7(a); and

  

### 

  

### (d) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Buyer
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

## Section 1.8. _Dissenting Shares_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by the Company Stockholders who have
demanded and perfected their demands for appraisal of such shares of Company
Common Stock in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and,
as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their
rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted as described in Section 1.7(a),
but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be entitled to only such rights as are
granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such holderÂ’s right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such
holderÂ’s shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted, at the Effective Time, as described in Section 1.7(a), as
applicable, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration set forth in
such provisions, without any interest thereon.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL with respect to demands for appraisal and received by the Company and
(ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by applicable
Law, make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal or offer
to settle or settle any such demands.

  

### 

  

## Section 1.9. _Stock Options and Restricted Stock_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The Company shall ensure that all outstanding options to acquire
Company Common Stock (the " _Company Options_ ") granted under the Horizon
PCS, Inc. Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan and the iPCS, Inc.
Third Amended and Restated 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "
_Company Stock Option Plans_ ") that are not exercised prior to the
Appointment Time shall terminate and be canceled at the Appointment Time, and
the Surviving Corporation shall pay such holder, immediately after the
Effective Time, in exchange for the cancellation of such holderÂ’s Company
Options, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (a) the excess, if any,
of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share of
the Company

  



        
   

  



  

### Option by (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock such holder
had the right to purchase at the Appointment Time, less any withholding Taxes
as described in Section 1.10(e) and without interest. The parties agree
that the Appointment Time shall constitute a change in control for purposes
of the Company Stock Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of
this Section 1.9(a), no holderÂ’s right to exercise a Company Option shall
accelerate and fully vest at the Appointment Time unless he or she is
employed (either as an employee, director or consultant) by the Company or a
Subsidiary at the Appointment Time unless otherwise required by the terms of
any award agreement evidencing a Company Stock Option or any Employment
Agreement between the Company (or any of its affiliates) and an optionholder.
The committee for each of the Company Stock Option Plans shall not exercise
any discretion to take any action with respect to any Company Option except

### 

  

## Section 1.10. _Surrender of Shares of Company Common Stock; Stock
Transfer Books_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the Company Stockholders to receive the funds necessary
to make the payments to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.7
upon surrender of the Company StockholdersÂ’ Certificates. Parent shall, at or
prior to the Effective Time, deposit with the Paying Agent the aggregate
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock (the " _Fund_ "). The Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments, shall be payable to Parent. Parent shall
replace any monies lost through any investment made pursuant to this Section
1.10(a). The Paying Agent shall make the payments provided in Section 1.7.

  

### 

  

### (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be mailed to
each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of
Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.7 (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive, in exchange
therefor, the Merger Consideration for each share of each series of Company
Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate

  



        
   

  



  

### shall then be canceled. Until so surrendered, each such
Certificate shall, at and after the Effective Time, represent for all
purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.  No interest
shall accrue or be paid to any beneficial owner of shares of Company Common
Stock or any holder of any Certificate with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered on the stock transfer books of
the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be endorsed in blank or to the Paying Agent or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer, in the sole discretion of the Paying Agent, and
that the person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to
a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes either
have been paid or are not applicable. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration such holder is entitled to receive pursuant
to Section 1.7.

  

### 

  

### (c) At any time following the date that is six months after the Effective
Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any portion of the Fund that had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to the Company Stockholders (including all interest and
other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all amounts held in
the Fund or other funds made available to it), and thereafter each such
holder shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar Laws), and only as general creditors
thereof, with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon
due surrender of the Certificates held by such holder. If any
Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock shall not have been
surrendered immediately prior to such date on which the Merger Consideration
in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such cash, shares, dividends or
distributions payable in respect of such Certificate shall become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Buyer or the Paying Agent shall be liable
to any Company Stockholder for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect
of such share of Company Common Stock to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law.

  

### 

  

### (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, except for Parent and Buyer, the Company
Stockholders holding shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by
applicable Law, and the Merger Consideration paid

  



         
 

  



  

### pursuant to this Article I upon the surrender or exchange of Certificates
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificates.

  

### 

  

### (e) Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration and any other amount otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any Company Stockholder or any holder of a Company Option
or Restricted Stock (each, a " _Payee_ ") such amounts that Parent, Buyer,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any amounts
so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to Payee.

  

### 

  

## Section 1.11. _Top-Up Option_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The Company hereby grants to the Buyer an irrevocable option (the "
_Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, to purchase at the Offer Price an
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ")
equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added
to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Buyer and
their affiliates at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one share of
Company Common Stock more than 90% of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock on a fully diluted basis; _provided, however_ , that in no
event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of shares of
Company Common Stock in excess of the number of authorized but
unissued shares of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares (giving effect to shares of Company Common
Stock reserved for issuance under all outstanding stock options, restricted
stock and any other rights to acquire Company Common Stock as if such shares
of Company Common Stock were outstanding); provided further, that the Top-Up
Option shall terminate upon the earlier of: (x) the fifth business day after
the later of (1) the expiration date of the Offer and (2) the expiration of
any "subsequent offering period"; and (y) the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms. The Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable
until such time as Buyer shall have accepted for payment the shares of
Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer and all shares tendered
in any "subsequent offering period" and in no event shall the Top-Up Option
be exercisable if the Minimum Tender Condition shall have been waived.

  

### 

  

### (b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up
Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable legal requirements of
all Governmental Entities, including compliance with an applicable exemption
from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the Securities Act.

  

### 

  

### (c) To exercise the Top-Up Option, the Buyer shall send to the Company a
written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ") specifying (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that shall be owned by Parent, Buyer and their
affiliates immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Shares and (ii)
the place, time

  



        
   

  



  

### and date (which date shall be no later than the fifth business day
following the date of the Top-Up Exercise Notice) for the closing of the
purchase and sale of the Top-Up Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The
Company shall, promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver
a written notice to the Buyer confirming the number of Top-Up Shares and the
aggregate purchase price therefor (the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the
Top-Up Closing, the Buyer shall pay the Company, in the manner set forth in
Section 1.11(d) hereof, the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-
Up Shares, in an aggregate principal amount equal to that specified in the
Top-Up Notice Receipt, and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered
to the Buyer a certificate or certificates representing the Top-Up Shares or,
at the BuyerÂ’s request or otherwise if the Company does not then have
certificated shares of Company Common Stock, the applicable number
of uncertificated shares represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_
"). Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any legends that
are required by applicable Law.

  

### 

  

### (d) Buyer may pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for
the Top-Up Shares either (i) entirely in cash or (ii) at BuyerÂ’s election, by
(x) paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value
of the Top-Up Shares and (y) executing and delivering to the Company a
promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance of the
aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount paid
in cash pursuant to the preceding clause (x) (a " _Promissory Note_ "). Any
such Promissory Note shall be full recourse against Parent and the Buyer and
(i) shall bear interest at the rate of 2% per annum, (ii) shall mature on the
first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such Promissory
Note and (iii) may be prepaid, in whole or in part, without premium or
penalty.

  

### 

  

### (e) Parent and Buyer acknowledge that the shares of Company Common Stock

authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of any
preemptive rights. The Company owns (either directly or indirectly)

## Section 5.2. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  

## 

  

### (a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and
shall cause the officers, directors, employees, auditors,
attorneys, financial advisors, lenders and other agents (collectively, the "
_Representatives_ ") of the Company to, afford the Representatives of Parent
and Buyer reasonable access at all reasonable times to the officers,

of any change or event that has or would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Buyer to perform its
respective obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.3 _,_ however, shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice. If any event or matter arises after the date of this
Agreement that, if existing or occurring at the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be set forth or described in the Company Disclosure
Letter or that is necessary to correct any information in the Company
Disclosure Letter that has been rendered inaccurate thereby, then the Company
shall promptly supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Letter that it has
delivered pursuant to this Agreement and deliver such supplement or amendment
to Parent.  No such supplement or amendment shall be deemed to cure any
breach of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement or have any
effect for purposes of satisfying any of the conditions set forth on _Exhibit
A_, or in Section 6.1 or the compliance by the Company with any covenant
set forth herein.

  

## 

  

## Section 5.4. _Further Assurances_.

  

##

taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under Law, subject to Section 5.5 _,_

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using all commercially
reasonable efforts to as promptly as reasonably practicable obtain all
licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and
orders of each Governmental Entity and parties to contracts with the Company
and the Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
fulfill the conditions set forth in Article VI and in _Exhibit A_. If at
any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers of
each party to this Agreement and the Surviving Corporation, subject to
Section 5.5 _,_ shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take all
such action.

  

### 

  

### (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.4(a), promptly after the
date hereof the Company and Parent shall prepare and file with the FCC an
application requesting its approval of the transfer of control of the FCC
License (the " _Approval Application_ "). The Company and Parent thereafter
shall diligently take or cooperate in the taking of all steps that are
necessary or appropriate to prosecute the Approval Application and to obtain
the grant of the Approval Application as expeditiously as
reasonably practicable. The parties agree to consult with one another as to
the approach to be taken with the FCC with respect to obtaining any
necessary consent or authority to the transactions contemplated hereby, and
each of the parties shall keep the other party reasonably informed as to the
status of any such communications with the FCC.

  



        
   

  



  

### (c) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.4(a), Parent and Buyer

or any of the Subsidiaries is awarded any grant applied for under the Rural
Utilities Service (the " _RUS_ ") Broadband Initiatives Program or the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (the " _NTIA_ ")
Broadband Technology Opportunities Program, the Company or any such
Subsidiary (i) will immediately notify Buyer of such award and (ii) will
immediately surrender the grant in the event any of the following occur: (A)
if the coordination with Buyer and Parent to effect the transfer of control
for the grant would result in a delay of the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger; or (B) if RUS or NTIA impose an unreasonable obligation on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as the awarded grant recipient (such
reasonableness to be the sole determination of Buyer).

  

### 

  

### (f) In connection with, and without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall (i) take all commercially reasonable actions necessary to ensure that
no state antitakeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
operative with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state
antitakeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes operative
with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, take all commercially
reasonable actions necessary to ensure that this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

## Section 5.5. _Board Recommendations_.

  

## 

  

### (a) In connection with the Offer, the Merger and the StockholdersÂ’
Meeting, the Board of Directors of the Company shall (i) subject to Section
5.5(b) _,_ recommend to the Company Stockholders to vote in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and use all commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the necessary approvals by the Company Stockholders of this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) otherwise comply with the legal requirements applicable to
such meeting and (iii) subject to Section 5.5(b), recommend to the holders of
the Company Common Stock to tender their shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer.

  

### 

  

### (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall, except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.5(b) _,_ (i)
withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or
modify, the approval or recommendation of such Board of Directors or such
committee of the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement, (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Alternative
Transaction (any action described in clause (i) above or in this clause (ii)
being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (iii) cause
the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement in compliance with the provisions of Section
5.9(b)) __ (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") related to any transaction
involving an Acquisition Proposal from a third party (an " _Alternative
Transaction_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to the Appointment
Time, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
receipt of advice from outside counsel, that it is required to do so to
comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable
Delaware Law, the Board of Directors of the Company may (subject to this and
the following sentences in this Section 5.5(b)) make an
Adverse Recommendation Change, but only at a time that is after the third
business day following ParentÂ’s receipt of written notice advising Parent
that (x) the Board of Directors of the Company has received a Superior
Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal that is reasonably likely to be a
Superior Proposal or (y) it is reasonably likely that an Intervening Event
has occurred. Such written notice shall specify, in the case of a Superior
Proposal or Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal or Acquisition Proposal (and include a copy thereof with
all accompanying documentation, if in writing), identify the person making
such Superior Proposal or Acquisition Proposal or, in the case of an
Intervening Event, attach information describing such Intervening Event in
reasonable detail, and, in each case, state that the Board of Directors of
the Company is considering making an Adverse Recommendation Change.  During
such three business day period, the Company shall provide an opportunity for
Parent to propose such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with its recommendation to
the Company Stockholders without an Adverse Recommendation Change; 
_provided, however_ , that any such proposed adjustment shall be at the
discretion of Parent at the time. For purposes of this Agreement, (1) a "
_Superior Proposal_ " means any proposal (on its most recently amended or
modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a third party to enter into
an Alternative Transaction that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in its good faith judgment (after

  



        
   

  



  

### obtaining the advice of an independent financial advisor) to be more
favorable to the Company Stockholders than the Offer and the Merger, taking
into account all relevant factors (including whether, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after obtaining the advice
of such independent financial advisor, the third party is reasonably able to
finance the transaction, and any proposed changes to this Agreement that may
be proposed by Parent in response to such Alternative Transaction) and (2) an
" _Intervening Event_ " means an event, unknown to the Board of Directors of
the Company as of the date of this Agreement, which becomes known prior to
the Appointment Time and which causes the Board of Directors of the Company
to determine in good faith, after obtaining the advice of outside counsel and
an independent financial advisor, that its failure to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Delaware Law; _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event shall the receipt, existence or terms of any Superior
Proposal or Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto or
consequence thereof constitute an Intervening Event.  Notwithstanding any
such Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, after the Appointment
Time, submit this Agreement to the Company Stockholders, with such
disclosures as shall be required by Law, and provided that in the event of an
Adverse Recommendation Change permitted under this Section 5.5(b), the Company
may submit this Agreement to the Company Stockholders without a
recommendation or with a negative recommendation, in which event the Board of
Directors of the Company may communicate the basis for its lack of
recommendation or negative recommendation to the Company Stockholders in the
Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto.  Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Board of
Directors of the Company from taking and disclosing to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a
third party or from making any similar disclosure, in either case to the
extent required by applicable Law; _provided,_ that the Company may not,
except as provided by this Section 5.5(b), withdraw, qualify or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent, the approval or recommendation of such Board of
Directors of the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement (it being understood
that a mere "stop, look and listen" disclosure in compliance with Rule
14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not violate this Section 5.5(b) or
constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change).

  

### 

  

## Section 5.6. _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company or Parent shall give the
other party the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of
any stockholder Litigation against the Company and its directors or Parent
and its directors, as the case may be, relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
no such settlement shall be agreed to without ParentÂ’s consent, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

## 

  

## Section 5.7. _Indemnification_.

  

## 

  

### (a) It is understood and agreed that all rights to indemnification by the
Company now existing in favor of each present and former director, officer,
employee and agent of the Company or the Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Company Certificate of
Incorporation or the Company Bylaws, in each

  



        
   

  



  

### case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other
agreements in effect on the date hereof, copies of which have been made
available to Parent, shall survive the Merger, and Parent shall, subject to
Section 5.7(c), (i) cause the Surviving Corporation to continue in full force
and effect for a period of at least six years from the Effective Time and
(ii) perform, or cause the Surviving Corporation to perform, in a timely
manner, the Surviving CorporationÂ’s obligation with respect thereto (without
regard to any discharge of such obligation in any bankruptcy or similar
proceeding). Parent and Buyer agree that any claims for indemnification
hereunder as to which they have received written notice prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time shall survive, whether or not such claims
shall have been finally adjudicated or settled.

  

### 

  

### (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time,
if available, the CompanyÂ’s current directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance policies covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently (and
any additional persons who prior to the Effective Time become) Indemnified
Parties (" _D andO Insurance_") (provided that the Surviving Corporation
may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound
carriers of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that
are not materially less favorable to the Indemnified Parties);
_provided, however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation
be required to expend pursuant to this Section 5.7(b) more than an amount
per year equal to 250% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for
such insurance. In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation would be required to expend
more than 250% of current annual premiums, the Surviving Corporation shall
obtain the maximum amount of such insurance obtainable by payment of annual
premiums equal to 250% of current annual premiums. If the
Surviving Corporation elects to reduce the amount of insurance coverage
pursuant to the preceding sentence, it will furnish to the officers and
directors currently covered by such DandO Insurance reasonable notice of such
reduction in coverage and shall, to the extent additional coverage is
available, afford such persons the opportunity to pay such additional
premiums as may be necessary to maintain the existing level of DandO Insurance
coverage. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may purchase, prior to the
Effective Time, a six-year "tail" prepaid officersÂ’ and directorsÂ’ liability
insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time covering each such Indemnified Party; _provided_ that the
premium and terms of such insurance are reasonably acceptable to Parent (it
being understood that a policy with a one-time premium not in excess of 250%
of the current annual premium shall be deemed to be reasonably acceptable to
Parent).

  

### 

  

### (c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.7 _._

  



        
   

  



  

### (d) The provisions of this Section 5.7 __ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives.

  

### 

  

## Section 5.8. _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except as may be required by Law or any listing
agreement with a national securities exchange or trading system to which
Parent or the Company is a party; _provided, however,_  that this Section
5.8 shall terminate in the event the Company makes an Adverse Recommendation
Change. The parties have agreed to the text of the initial press release to
be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## Section 5.9. _Acquisition Proposals_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The Company shall, on the date hereof, terminate (and shall cause
each Subsidiary to terminate) all direct and indirect negotiations
and discussions with all other parties with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or any potential Acquisition Proposal.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of the
Subsidiaries or Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of any Acquisition
Proposal or (ii) participate in or knowingly encourage any discussion or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information
with respect to, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate any
inquiries or the making of, any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however_ , that
the foregoing shall not prohibit the Company (as authorized by the Board of
Directors) from furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, any person or entity that makes an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal prior to the Appointment Time if, and only to the extent that, (A)
the Board of Directors of the Company, after obtaining the advice of
independent outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that such action
is required for the Board of Directors of the Company to comply with its
fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders under applicable Delaware
Law, (B) prior to taking such action, the Company receives from such person
or entity an executed agreement in reasonably customary form relating to the
confidentiality of information to be provided to such person or entity
containing provisions no less favorable to the Company than those set forth
in the Confidentiality Agreement (provided that such agreement need not
contain any "standstill" or similar provision) and (C) the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in good faith, after obtaining advice from its
independent financial advisor, that the Acquisition Proposal is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal. The Company shall provide prompt (and
at least within 24 hours) oral and written notice to Parent of (1) the
receipt of any such Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry that could reasonably
be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (2) the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, (3) the identity of such
person or entity making any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and (4) the
CompanyÂ’s intention to furnish information to, or enter into

become participants for purposes of participation, eligibility, vesting and
level of benefits (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan or any plan providing post-retirement medical, dental or

periods or required physical examinations under any welfare benefit plans of
Parent and its subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to be
waived with respect to Affected Employees and their eligible dependents to

of Directors) shall take all such steps as may be required to cause each
agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by the Company or its
Subsidiaries on or after the date hereof with any of its officers, directors
or employees pursuant to which consideration is paid to such officer,
director or employee to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance
or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule

such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time

more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

## Section 8.5. _Governing Law; Venue; Service of Process, Waiver of
Jury Trial_.

### 

  

### (c) Each party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner

## Section 8.6. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement
that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and
provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the
court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have
the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and

parties agrees that the other party shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof
without any obligation to post any bond or other security as a prerequisite
to obtaining equitable relief.  If a court of competent jurisdiction has
declined to specifically enforce the obligations of Parent and Buyer to
consummate the Offer pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought
against Parent and Buyer pursuant to this Section 8.7, the Company may then
pursue any other remedy available to it at Law or in equity including
monetary damages (which the parties agree may not be limited to reimbursement
of expenses or out-of-pocket costs and, notwithstanding Section 8.1, to the
extent proven, may be determined by reference to the amount, if any, that
would have been recoverable by the Company Stockholders if such Company

(relating to BuyerÂ’s obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of
Company Common Stock promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the
Offer), to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant
to the Offer unless, by the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended
in accordance with Section 1.1 of this Agreement), (i) there shall have been
validly tendered and not withdrawn that number of shares of Company
Common Stock which would represent at least a majority **** of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on a fully diluted basis (the "
_Minimum Tender Condition_ ") and (ii) each of the following conditions shall
be satisfied:

  



  

(a) No temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or
other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal
restraint or prohibition (including, any statute, rule, regulation,
injunction, order or decree proposed, enacted, enforced, promulgated, issued
or deemed applicable to, or any consent or approval withheld with respect to,
the Offer or the Merger, by any Governmental Entity) preventing the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger shall be in effect;

  



  

(b) (i) Each of the representations and warranties (other than as set forth
in Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.12) of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall be true and correct on the date of this Agreement, and as of the
expiration of the Offer, as if made at and as of such date (except to the
extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true
and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein), individually or in the
aggregate, does not have, and would not be reasonably expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) each of the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.12 shall be true and correct
in all material respects on the date of this Agreement, and as of the
expiration of the Offer, as if made at and as of such date (except to the
extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date)
and (iii) the Company shall have performed in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement;

  



  

(c) The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall have expired or
been terminated;

  



  

(d) There shall not have occurred any change, condition, event or development
that, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted in, or would reasonably
be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect;

  



  

(e) This Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with its
terms;

  



        
   

  



  

(f) All PSC Approvals shall have been obtained; and

  



  

(g) The FCC shall have granted consent to the transfer of control of the FCC
License and the FCC shall have approved the transfer of control application
for the FCC authorization, file number ITC-214-19970306-00135, provided that
such FCC consent or approval shall not be deemed to require a Final Order. "
_Final Order_ " means an action or decision of the FCC as to which (i)
no request for a stay or similar request is pending, no stay is in effect,
the action or decision has not been vacated, reversed, set aside, annulled
or suspended and any deadline for filing such request that may be designated
by statute or regulation has passed, (ii) no petition for rehearing
or reconsideration or application for review is pending and the time for
the filing of any such petition or application has passed, (iii) the FCC
does not have the action or decision under reconsideration on its own motion
and the time within which it may effect such reconsideration has passed and
(iv) no appeal is pending including other administrative or judicial review,
or in effect and any deadline for filing any such appeal that may be
designated by statute or rule has passed.

  



  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Buyer, may be
asserted by Parent or Buyer regardless of the circumstances giving rise to
such condition, and may be waived by Parent or Buyer in whole or in part at
any time and from time to time and in the sole and absolute discretion of
Parent or Buyer, subject in each case to the terms of this Agreement
(including Section 1.1(a)).  The failure by Parent or Buyer at any time to

such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend or to
authorize the issuance of stock or adopt a certificate of ownership and

by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against
expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with

interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such personÂ’s conduct was
unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did
not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe
that such personÂ’s conduct was unlawful.

director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving
at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred
by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or
suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect
of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been
adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that
the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon
application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all
the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled
to indemnity for such expenses which the court shall deem proper.

  



  

 **Section 5.3. Expense Indemnity.** To the extent that a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or a person serving in any
other enterprise at the request of the Corporation, has been successful on
the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred
to in Section 5.1 and 5.2 or in defense of any claim, issue or matter
therein, such director, officer, employee or agent shall be indemnified
against expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred
by such person in connection therewith.

  



  

 **Section 5.4. Procedure.** Any indemnification under Sections 5.1 and 5.2
(unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only
as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification
of the director, officer, or employee is proper in the circumstances because
such director, officer, employee or agent has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.2. Such determination shall be made
(a) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of
directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (b) if
such a quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable, a quorum of
disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written
opinion, or (c) by the stockholders.

  



  

 **Section 5.5. Advances of Expenses.** Expenses (including attorneysÂ’
fees) incurred by a director or officer in defending a civil or criminal
action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the
final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amount
if it is ultimately determined that the director or officer is not entitled
to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Section. Such
expenses incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such
terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.

  



  

 **Section 5.6. Non-Exclusive Rights.** The indemnification and advancement
of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other subsections of
this Section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those
seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any
Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or

  



        
   

  



  

otherwise, both as to action in a personÂ’s official capacity and as to action
in another capacity while holding such office.

  



  

The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person
who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and
incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such personÂ’s
status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this
Article.

  



  

 **Section 5.8. Continuation of Indemnities.** For purposes of this
Article, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the
resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent
of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its
separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority
to indemnify its directors, officers and employees or agents, so that any
person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such
constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall
stand in the same position under this Section with respect to the resulting
or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such
constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.

  



  

 **Section 5.9. Definition.** For purposes of this Article, references to
"other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to
"fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to
any employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the
Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by,
such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit
plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith
and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be
deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation" as referred to in this Section.

  



  

 **Section 5.10. Benefits.** The indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article shall, unless otherwise
provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased
to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit
of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

  



  

 **ARTICLE SIX**

  



  

 **GENERAL PROVISIONS**

  



  

 **Section 6.1. Waiver of Notice.** Whenever notice is required by the
Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or any provision of the

signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time
required for such notice, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of
a

objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither
the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special
meeting of the stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors
need be specified in any written waiver of notice.

be the calendar year unless the Board of Directors shall from time to
time otherwise prescribe.
