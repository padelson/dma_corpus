Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to holders of Company Shares or

shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Company Shares or Options in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

SECTION 2.11. _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the

not contain any conditions to the payment of any portion of the Per Share
Merger Consideration not agreed to by the Company prior to the Closing or
contain any provisions that

 



14  are not contemplated by this Agreement, other than customary mechanical
provisions. As promptly as practicable after finalizing such Letter of
Transmittal, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the

holder of Company Shares on the date thereof and from time to time thereafter
as requested by Parent or the Company.

_however_ , that to the extent that holders of Company Shares provide
certificates representing such Company Shares (" _Certificates_ ") and
completed Letters of Transmittal to Parent or the Company at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, then the Per Share Merger
Consideration payable with respect to such Shares shall be paid by Parent at
the Closing to such holder by wire transfer of immediately available funds;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that no gains or losses on the funds deposited with
the Paying Agent shall affect the Per Share Merger Consideration payable to
the holders of Company Shares and following any losses that result in the
amount of such funds being insufficient to pay the portion of the aggregate
Per Share Merger Consideration that remains unpaid, Parent shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the former
stockholders of the Company to the extent of any insufficiency. After the
Effective Time, upon surrender of such Certificates to the Paying Agent,
together with the completed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive from the Paying Agent, in
exchange therefor, the Per Share Merger Consideration for such Company Shares
as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
any Company Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the Paying Agent shall pay the Per Share Merger Consideration in
respect of such Company Shares to the transferee if such transferee presents
to the Paying Agent documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer and reasonable evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid.

(d) _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. At any time following the expiration of
one (1) year after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any
interest with respect thereto) which had been made available to the
Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of the Company
Shares. Thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws) and only as general creditors thereof for payment of their
claim for the Per Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.
None of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, any Affiliate of the
foregoing or any other Person shall be liable for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

(e)  _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Company or the Surviving Corporation may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Surviving Corporation shall issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated in writing

has heretofore made available to Parent true and complete copies of its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date hereof.

 

(b) _Schedule 3.01(b)_ sets forth the name and jurisdiction of organization of

Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be

documentation requested by any Governmental Authority relating thereto. All
filing fees payable in connection with the notifications, filings,
registrations, submissions or other materials contemplated by this _Section
5.05_ shall be paid entirely by Parent. Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement and applicable Laws, the parties to this Agreement shall, and
Parent shall cause its Affiliates to, coordinate and cooperate fully and
promptly with each other in exchanging such information and providing such
assistance as the other parties may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods,
including those under the HSR Act and any applicable Foreign Antitrust Law.

 

(b) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, each party to this
Agreement shall promptly notify and furnish the other parties copies of (i)
any filing such party or any of its Affiliates submits to any Governmental
Authority and (ii) any correspondence or communication between it or any of
its Affiliates or any of their respective representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Authority, on the other hand, in each case relating to
the subject matter of this _Section 5.05_ or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (and, in the case of any oral communication, a summary of
such communication) and shall consult with and permit the other parties to
review in advance any proposed filing and any written or oral

 



36  communication or correspondence by such party to any Governmental Authority
relating to the subject matter of this _Section 5.05_ or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and shall consider in good faith the views of
such party in connection with any proposed filing and any written or oral
communication or correspondence to any Governmental Authority, including the
FTC and the DOJ, relating to the subject matter of this  _Section 5.05_ or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No party to this Agreement
shall agree to, or permit any of its Affiliates or any of its or their
respective representatives to, participate in any meeting or discussion with
any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation, inquiry
or any other matter contemplated by this _Section 5.05 _or any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other parties
in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives
the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or
discussion.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and the
Company shall, and Parent shall cause its Affiliates to, take any and all
actions necessary to obtain any consents, clearances or approvals required
under or in connection with the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the
Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any
other federal or state law, regulation or decree designed or intended to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions or transactions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization, restraint of trade or harm to competition, including
any Foreign Antitrust Law (collectively " _Antitrust Laws_ "), and to enable
all waiting periods under any Antitrust Law to expire, and to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law asserted by any
Governmental Authority, in each case, to cause the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby to occur as promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement and, in any event, prior to the
Termination Date, including (i) promptly complying with or modifying any
requests or inquiries for additional information or documentation (including
any second request) by any Governmental Authority, (ii) offering, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of any and all
of the capital stock, assets, rights, products or businesses of Parent and its
Affiliates and the Company and its Subsidiaries and any other restrictions on
the activities of Parent and its Affiliates and the Company and its
Subsidiaries and (iii) contesting, defending and appealing any threatened or
pending Litigation or preliminary or permanent injunction or other Order or
Law that would adversely affect the ability of any party hereto to consummate,
or otherwise delay the consummation of, the transactions contemplated hereby
and taking any and all other actions to prevent the entry, enactment or
promulgation thereof; _provided_ that Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not be
required to take any action that would be materially adverse to Parent and
its Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
in no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates be obligated to commit
to take any action pursuant to this _Section 5.05_, the consummation of which
is not conditioned on the consummation of the Closing, or pay any fee or grant
any concession in connection with obtaining any consents, authorizations or
approvals required in order to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(d) In the event Parent, the Company or any of the Parents Affiliates
receives a second request under the HSR Act or any similar inquiry or request
under applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, such party

 



37  shall promptly comply (and in the case of Parent cause its Affiliates to
promptly comply) with such request (i) as provided by Section 7A(e) of the HSR
Act or (ii) as otherwise provided under applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws, it
being acknowledged and agreed by the parties hereto that time is of the
essence. For purposes of this provision, such Persons shall be deemed to have
complied with any such request by providing a response that such Person in
good faith believes to be in substantial compliance and by certifying in
writing to the other parties its prompt, substantial compliance. In the event
that any such Person receives a subpoena or civil investigative demand
requesting materials and information similar to that usually demanded in a
second request under the HSR Act or any similar inquiry or request under
applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws, such Person shall promptly comply (and in
the case of Parent cause its Affiliates to promptly comply) with such
subpoena or civil investigative demand, it being acknowledged by the parties
hereto that time is of the essence. In the event the Governmental Authority
disputes the adequacy of compliance by any such Person with respect to a
second request under the HSR Act or any similar inquiry or request under
applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws, subpoena or civil investigative demand,
such party shall endeavor (and in the case of Parent cause its Affiliates to
endeavor) to satisfy the Governmental Authority so as to minimize any delay in
the conduct or resolution of the investigation.

(e) From the date of this Agreement through the date (i) of termination of the
required waiting periods under the HSR Act and all applicable Foreign
Antitrust Laws and (ii) the Required Parent Consents are obtained, the Parent
and its Affiliates shall not take any action that could reasonably be expected
to hinder or delay, as applicable, the obtaining of clearance or the
expiration of the required waiting periods under the HSR Act and such
applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws, or the obtaining of the Required Parent
Consents from the applicable Governmental Authorities.

(f) The parties acknowledge and agree that the obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.05_ shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of the
generality of, the matters set forth in  _Section 5.03_ and _Section 5.04_.

SECTION 5.06. _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Laws,
during the period from the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
parties hereto through the earlier of the Closing and the date on which this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VII_ , the Company shall
permit, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to permit, Parent and its advisors,
accountants, attorneys and authorized representatives to have reasonable
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the
offices, facilities, assets, properties, management-level employees and books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall furnish, or cause
to be furnished, to Parent, such financial, tax and operating data and other
information with respect to such entities and their respective offices,
facilities, assets, properties, employees, businesses and operations as
Parent shall from time to time reasonably request; _provided_ , that nothing
herein shall obligate the Company to produce any such information outside of
the ordinary course of business. All access and investigation pursuant to
this _Section 5.06_ shall be coordinated through the Companys (i) Chief
Executive Officer, (ii) Chief Financial Officer, (iii) Executive Vice
President of Finance, (iv) Executive Vice President, President, Global
Pharmaceuticals, (v) General Counsel or (vi)

 



38  any designee thereof and shall be conducted at Parents expense and in such
a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein or otherwise, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
where such access or disclosure would reasonably be expected to (i)
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or other immunity or protection from
disclosure of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) contravene any Law, any
Contract entered into prior to the date hereof or any other obligation of
confidentiality, or (iii) result in the disclosure of competitively sensitive
information, provided that the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
will attempt in good faith to make such alternative arrangements as may
be reasonably necessary to provide the relevant information in a way that
would not risk waiver of such privilege, immunity or protection or contravene
such Law or Contract or result in such disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein or otherwise, prior to the Closing, Parent
shall have no right to perform invasive or subsurface investigations of the
properties or facilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the
prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld). The Company shall have the right to have one or more of its
representatives present at all times during any visits, examinations,
discussions or contacts contemplated by this  _Section 5.06_.

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (in each case
for so long as controlled by Parent after the Effective Time), preserve and
keep the records held by them and the Subsidiaries of the Surviving
Corporation relating to the respective businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for a period of seven (7) years from
the Closing Date (or longer if required by applicable Law) and shall, subject
to applicable Law, make such records (or copies) and reasonably appropriate
personnel available, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice, as may be reasonably required by any holder of Company Shares in
connection with any insurance claims by, Litigation or Tax audits against,
governmental investigations of, or compliance with legal requirements by,
any holder of Company Shares or any of their respective Affiliates.

(c) The parties agree that the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are
incorporated by reference herein and shall continue in full force and effect
until the Closing. Parent and Merger Sub shall hold, and shall cause the
Bidders Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to
hold, any Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
provided to them in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in confidence in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. The Company shall hold, and shall cause its representatives to
keep, any confidential information relating to Parent or its Affiliates
provided to them in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement confidential law, except to the extent disclosure is required by
Law.

SECTION 5.07. _Public Statements_. Except as required by applicable Law or the
rules and regulations of any applicable stock exchange, in which event the
parties shall consult with each other in advance and provide the non-
disclosing party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, no
press release or other public announcement, statement or comment relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be issued, made or
permitted to be issued or made by any party to this Agreement or any of its
Affiliates or 

 



39  representatives without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any Affiliate of a holder of Company
Shares may disclose the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
material term hereof to its investors and potential investors in the ordinary
course of business and (ii) nothing in this _Section 5.07_ shall prohibit any
disclosure required under the Credit Agreements or the Indenture.

SECTION 5.08. _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time (including in respect of any matters arising in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby), now
existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, or employees,
as the case may be, (each, a " _D andO Indemnified Person_") of the Company or
its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificate of
incorporation, by-laws, or other equivalent governing documents or in any
agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect. For a period of at least six (6) years after the Effective Time, (i)
Parent shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Surviving
Corporations or any of its Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation, by-
laws or other equivalent governing documents relating to the exculpation,
indemnification or advancement of expenses of any DandO Indemnified Person with
respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including in respect of any matters arising in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby), unless and only to the extent
required by Law, it being the intent of the parties that all such DandO
Indemnified Persons shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law and that no change, modification or amendment of such documents
or arrangements may be made that will adversely affect any such Persons
right thereto without the prior written consent of that Person and (ii) Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
maintain any indemnification agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
with any DandO Indemnified Person.

(b) In addition to the other rights provided for in this  _Section 5.08_ and
not in limitation thereof, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (each, a " _D andO
Indemnifying Party_") to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
(i) indemnify and hold harmless (and exculpate and release from any liability
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) the DandO
Indemnified Persons against all DandO Expenses (as defined below) and all
losses, claims, damages, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement (" _D andO Losses_") in respect of any threatened, pending or
completed claim, action, inquiry, suit, proceeding or judgment,
whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, based on, arising
out of, relating to or in connection with the fact that such Person is or was
a director, officer, employee or other fiduciary of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or of any other entity arising out of or relating to acts or
omissions occurring or existing (or alleged to have occurred or existed) at,
prior to or after the Effective Time (including in respect of acts or
omissions in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby) (a " _D andO Indemnifiable Claim_") and (ii) advance, unconditionally
and interest-free, to such DandO Indemnified Persons all DandO

 



40  Expenses incurred in connection with any DandO Indemnifiable Claim (including
in circumstances where the DandO Indemnifying Party is otherwise entitled to
assume the defense of such claim and has assumed such defense) promptly after
receipt of statements therefor. Advance payment of DandO Expenses in connection
with any DandO Indemnifiable Claims shall continue until such DandO Indemnifiable
Claim is disposed of or all judgments, orders, decrees or other rulings in
connection with such DandO Indemnifiable Claim become final and nonappealable
and are fully and finally satisfied. For the purposes of this _Section
5.08(b)_, " _D andO Expenses_" shall include attorneys fees, expert fees,
arbitrator and mediator fees, and all other costs, charges and expenses paid
or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or
otherwise participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend, to
be a witness in or participate in, any DandO Indemnifiable Claim, but shall
exclude losses, claims, damages, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid
in settlement (which items are included in the definition of DandO Losses).

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to
obtain and fully pay for, at Parents expense, "tail" insurance policies with
a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
from an insurance carrier with, to the extent reasonably available, the same
or better credit ratings as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to officers and directors liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"), for the persons who
are covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage (including as coverage relates to
deductibles and exclusions) at least as favorable as the Companys existing
DandO Insurance with respect to matters arising out of or relating to acts or
omissions occurring or existing (or alleged to have occurred or existed) at,
prior to or after the Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby), and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain such DandO Insurance in full force and
effect for its full term. If the Parent and the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, the Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue
to maintain in effect the Companys existing DandO Insurance, at no expense to
the beneficiaries, for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, for the persons who are covered by the Companys existing DandO
Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage
(including as coverage relates to deductibles and exclusions) at least as
favorable as provided in the Companys existing DandO Insurance as of the date
of this Agreement, or, if such insurance is unavailable, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase the best available DandO
Insurance for such six-year period from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect
to the Companys existing DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage (including as coverage relates to deductibles and
exclusions) at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing DandO
Insurance as of the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
no event shall the Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such DandO Insurance; _provided_ that
if the annual premiums of such coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount for such six-
year period from an insurance carrier with, to the extent reasonably
available, the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier with respect to the Companys existing DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage (including as coverage relates
to deductibles and exclusions) at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement.

 



41 (d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys 50% or more of its
properties and other assets to any Person (including by liquidation,
dissolution, assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar action), then,
and in each such case, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable successors
and assigns or transferees expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.08_.

(e) Each of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be a full
indemnitor of first resort, shall be required to advance the full amount of
all DandO Expenses incurred by a DandO Indemnified Person and shall be liable for
the full amount of all DandO Losses to the extent legally permitted and as
required, without regard to any rights a DandO Indemnified Person may have
against Sponsor or any other holder of Company Shares or any of their
respective Affiliates or otherwise or any insurer providing insurance coverage
under an insurance policy issued to Sponsor or any other holder of Company
Shares or any of their respective Affiliates.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or otherwise,
the rights and benefits of the DandO Indemnified Persons under this _Section
5.08_ shall not be terminated or modified in any manner as to adversely affect
any DandO Indemnified Person without the prior written consent of such DandO
Indemnified Person. The provisions of this  _Section 5.08_ are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified
Person referred to in _Section 5.08(a)_, his or her heirs and his or her
executors, administrators and personal representatives, each of whom is an
intended third-party beneficiary of this _Section 5.08_, and are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights, including rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or
otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 5.08_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger.

SECTION 5.09. _Employee Benefits_.

(a) During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide each continuing employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with compensation (other than equity compensation), benefits,
perquisites and other terms and conditions of employment that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to the compensation (other than equity
compensation), benefits, perquisites and other terms and conditions of
employment that he or she was eligible to receive immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

(b) From and after the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to honor, pay, perform and satisfy any and all
liabilities, obligations and responsibilities to, or in respect of, each
employee and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and each former
employee and officer of Company and its Subsidiaries, as of the Closing
arising under the terms of, or in connection with, any Plan in accordance with
the terms thereof (including terms permitting the termination or amendment
thereof).

 



42 (c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual (other than benefit
accrual under a defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical plan) and
entitlement to benefits, including the determination of the level of vacation
and severance pay benefits under the benefit and compensation plans, programs,
agreements and arrangements of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective subsidiaries in which employees are eligible to participate
following the Closing (the " _Parent Plans_ "), Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall credit each employee with his or her years of service with
the Company, its Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities, to the same extent
as such employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for
such service under any similar Plan, except where such crediting would result
in duplication of benefits. Parent Plans shall not deny employees coverage on
the basis of pre-existing conditions to the extent such conditions were waived
or satisfied under similar Plans immediately prior to the Closing and shall
credit such employees for any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid
prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses in the applicable plan year to which such deductibles and out-of-
pocket expenses relate.

(d) After the execution of this Agreement and in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
consultation with Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries will provide any
required notice to, or engage in any required consultation with, any labor
union, works council or other labor organization, pursuant to any
collective bargaining agreement, works council agreement or similar Contract
with any labor organization or employee association to which the Company or
its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by or pursuant to applicable Laws.

 

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 5.09_ with respect to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any other Person, including any
employee, former employee or any participant or any beneficiary thereof
in any Plan or Parent Plan, or (ii) in consultation with Parent, to continued
employment with the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. After the Effective Time, nothing contained in this _Section
5.09_ is intended to be or shall be considered to be an amendment or adoption
of any plan, program, agreement, arrangement or policy of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving Corporation nor shall it interfere
with Parents, the Surviving Corporations or any of the Surviving
Corporations Subsidiaries right to amend, modify or terminate any Plan
(subject to the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.09_) or to terminate
the employment of any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any
reason, provided that the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall be
subject to the provisions of _Section 5.09(a)_.

 

(f) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
but in no event later than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company will submit to a stockholder vote (in compliance with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder) the right of any
individual who is or could reasonably be expected to be, as of the Closing
Date, a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code)
to receive payments and benefits that could be deemed a "parachute payment"
(as defined in Section 

 



43  280G(b)(2) of the Code), in a manner reasonably designed to cause the
payments and benefits that would otherwise constitute a "parachute payment" be
exempt from the definition of "parachute payment" by reason of the exemption
provided under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code.

 

SECTION 5.10. _Termination of Affiliate Arrangements_. All Contracts between
the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, on the one hand, and any of their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand, other than (a) the Contracts listed
on _Schedule 5.09(d)_ , (b) Contracts referred to in _Section 5.08_ and (c)
Contracts solely between the Company and one or more of its Subsidiaries or
between or among its Subsidiaries, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date,
and all obligations and liabilities thereunder shall have been satisfied
(except to the extent that any such agreement contains provisions which
provide for the survival of such provisions following the termination of such
agreement, in which case such provisions shall survive such termination in
accordance with their respective terms).

 

SECTION 5.11. _Financing Assistance; Repayment of Debt_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, and through the earlier of the
Closing and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Article VII_ , the Company shall, and the Company shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and each of its and their representatives to, use its respective
reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation that is
necessary, customary or advisable and reasonably requested by Parent to
assist Parent in the arrangement of any Debt Financing or any Rule 144A bond
financing undertaken in replacement of all or a portion of such Debt Financing
(the " _Bond Financing_ " and, together with the Debt Financing, the "
_Financing_ ") for the purposes of financing the Aggregate Purchase Price, any
repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and any other amounts
required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and all related fees and expenses of Parent and Merger Sub
(it being acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub that the receipt
of such Financing is not a condition to the consummation of the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement), including (A)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings, road shows, rating agency
sessions and drafting sessions, and participating in reasonable and customary
due diligence, (B) furnishing the financial institutions providing or
arranging the Debt Financing and the Bond Financing (the " _Financing
Sources_ ") with such financial and other pertinent information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested to consummate the
Debt Financing and the Bond Financing, including all financial statements and
financial data of the type required in a Bond Financing by Parent by
Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of the type and
form customarily included in private placements pursuant to Rule 144A
promulgated under the Securities Act (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall not include information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries
required by Items 3-09, 3-10 and 3-16 of Regulation S-X and Item 402(b) of
Regulation S-K) (collectively, the " _Required Information_ "), (C) assisting
Parent and the Financing Sources in the preparation of (1) offering documents
for the Debt Financing and the Bond Financing and (2) materials for rating
agency presentations, bank confidential information memoranda, business
projections and similar documents in connection with the Debt Financing and
the Bond Financing, (D) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts for
any portion of the Debt Financing and the Bond Financing and (E) using its
reasonable efforts to

 



44  cause its independent accountants to provide assistance and cooperation in
the Debt Financing and the Bond Financing, including (1) participating in a
reasonable number of drafting sessions and accounting due diligence sessions,
(2) providing any necessary customary consents to use their audit reports
relating to the Company and (3) providing any necessary customary "comfort
letters," (F) executing and delivering customary definitive financing
documents to the extent reasonably requested by Parent and otherwise
facilitating the pledging of collateral reasonably necessary to secure the
Debt Financing or the Bond Financing; _provided_ that the effectiveness of
any definitive documentation executed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be subject to the consummation of the Merger and (G)
furnishing Parent and any Financing Sources promptly, and in any event at
least five days prior to the Closing Date, with all documentation and other
information required by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Debt
Financing and the Bond Financing under applicable "know your customer" and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of
2001, as amended. Nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent
it would (A) unreasonably disrupt the conduct of the business or operations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, (B) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or otherwise
incur any liability or give any indemnities prior to the Effective Time or (C)
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action that would
reasonably be expected to conflict with, or result in any violation or breach
of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other comparable organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any applicable Laws, the
Credit Agreements or any Contract. In furtherance of and without limitation to
the immediately preceding sentence, nothing herein shall require the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to, prior to the Effective Time, enter into any
agreement (or require their respective boards of directors or equivalent
governing bodies to approve any such agreement) in connection with the
Financing. Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
representatives in connection with the Financing and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing and any information used in connection therewith (other than (x)
arising from fraud, intentional misrepresentation, misstatements or omissions
on the part of the Company or its Affiliates or (y) written historical
information of the type prepared by the Company or its Affiliates in the
ordinary course of business that is provided by the Company or any of its
Affiliates). This _Section 5.11(a)_ shall not apply to, or require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action in connection with, the
matters addressed in _Section 5.12_, which matters are governed exclusively
by such section.

 

(b) The Company shall deliver to Parent a copy of a payoff letter in form and

(subject to delivery of funds as arranged by Parent as contemplated by
_Section 2.14(c)_), specifying the aggregate amount required to be paid to

the Company and its Subsidiaries securing all such obligations (subject to

45 SECTION 5.12. _Treatment of Senior Notes_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to commence, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, at Parents expense, after the receipt of a written request from
Parent to do so, tender offers to purchase, and any related consent
solicitations with respect to, the Senior Notes on such terms and conditions
as specified by Parent and in compliance with all applicable terms and
conditions of the Indenture (collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ "); _provided_
that (i) the provisions of _Sections 5.12(d)_ and _5.12(e)_ shall have been
satisfied, and shall continue to be satisfied, in all respects, (ii) Parent
shall have provided the Company with the offer to purchase, related letter of
transmittal, and other related documents (collectively, the "
_Offer Documents_ ") and (iii) the closing of the Debt Offers shall be
conditioned on the Closing and shall otherwise comply with all applicable Laws
and SEC rules and regulations. The terms and conditions specified by Parent
for the Debt Offers shall be only such terms and conditions as are
customarily included in offers to purchase debt securities similar to the
Senior Notes and in similar situations and shall otherwise be in compliance
with all applicable Laws and the terms and conditions of the Indenture.
Nothing in this _Section 5.12_ or in any other provision of this Agreement
shall require the Company or any of its Affiliates to purchase, or accept for
purchase, any Senior Notes tendered or otherwise submitted for payment prior
to the Effective Time. The parties hereto shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, and shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their respective representatives to,
provide cooperation reasonably requested by the other in connection with the
Debt Offers.

(b) Subject to _Sections 5.12(d)_ and  _5.12(e)_ , if requested by Parent in
writing, in lieu of commencing a Debt Offer for the Senior Notes (or in
addition thereto) pursuant to _Section 5.12(a)_, the Company shall, to the
extent permitted by the Indenture (i) issue a notice of optional redemption
(the " _Redemption Notice_ ") for all of the outstanding principal amount of
the Senior Notes pursuant to the requisite provisions of the Indenture or (ii)
take actions reasonably requested by Parent that are reasonably necessary for
the satisfaction, discharge and/or defeasance of the Senior Notes pursuant to
the applicable provisions of the Indenture, and shall redeem or satisfy,
discharge and/or defease, as applicable, such Senior Notes at the Closing in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture (the " _Debt Redemption_ ");
_provided_ that to the extent that any action described in clause (i) or (ii)
can be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, it will be so
conditioned, and, prior to the Company being required to take any of the
actions described in clause (i) or (ii) above, Parent shall deposit with the
trustee under the Indenture cash or cash equivalents sufficient to effect
such redemption, satisfaction, discharge and/or defeasance (and in the event
of any loss with respect to the funds deposited with the trustee Parent shall
deposit additional funds sufficient to satisfy such redemption, satisfaction,
discharge and/or defeasance, as applicable). The parties hereto shall, shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to, and shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective representatives to,
provide cooperation reasonably requested by the other in connection with the
Debt Redemption.

(c) In the event that the Company commences a Debt Offer, the
Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following any related consent
solicitation expiration date, assuming the requisite consents are received,
each of the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries as is necessary shall (and
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause

 



46  the applicable trustee to) execute a supplemental indenture to the
Indenture, which shall implement the amendments described in the Offer
Documents, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including
the conditions to the Debt Offers); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
officers, directors or other representatives, have any obligation
to authorize, adopt or execute any supplemental indenture or other agreement
that would become effective prior to the Closing. Concurrently with the
Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to accept for payment
and thereafter promptly pay for, any Senior Notes that have been validly
tendered pursuant to and in accordance with the Debt Offers and not properly
withdrawn using funds provided by Parent.

(d) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with any Debt Offers and Debt Redemptions, including the Offer
Documents and the Redemption Notice, as applicable. The parties hereto shall,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with
each other in the preparation of any Offer Documents and Redemption Notices.
The Company shall, to the extent requested, keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding the status, results and timing of the Debt Offers. The Offer
Documents (including all amendments or supplements thereto) and all mailings
to the holders of the Senior Notes in connection with any Debt Offers and Debt
Redemptions shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment by, the
Company and its legal counsel, and shall be reasonably acceptable to them. If,
at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offers, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the other hand, discovers any information that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, such party that discovers such information shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other party, and
an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by Parent describing such
information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to the holders of the Senior Notes. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section 5.12(d)_, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and any other Law to the extent
applicable in connection with the Debt Offers and such compliance will not be
deemed a breach hereof.

(e) In connection with any Debt Offer and any Debt Redemption, Parent may
select one or more dealer managers, information agents, depositaries and other
agents, in each case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to
provide assistance in connection therewith and the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into customary agreements with such parties
so selected; _provided_ , that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless, or pay
the fees or reimburse the costs and expenses of, any such party, which
indemnification, fee and reimbursement obligations shall be borne by Parent
pursuant to separate agreements with such parties to which neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be a party or have any obligations
under. Parent shall reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all of
their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with any Debt
Offers or any Debt Redemptions promptly following the incurrence thereof.
Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold

 



47  harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective
Affiliates, and other Person that would be a Non-Recourse Party of any of the
foregoing, from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties (excluding, to the
extent previously reimbursed, the costs and expenses referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence) suffered or incurred by any such Person, or
to which any such Person may become subject, that arise out of, or is in any
way in connection with, the Debt Offers, Debt Redemption, or any actions taken
or not taken by the Company, or taken at the request of Parent, pursuant
to this _Section 5.12_ or the transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing in
this _Section 5.12_ shall require the Company to take, or cause any other
Person to take, any action that is not permitted by the Indenture (or any
other Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party) or
applicable Law.

SECTION 5.13. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, real
property, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes, fees and costs
(including any associated penalties and interest) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ")
incurred in connection with the Merger, if any, shall be paid by Parent when
due, whether levied on Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any
Subsidiary of the Company or any holder of Company Shares, and Parent shall
file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any
such Transfer Taxes.

SECTION 5.14. _Assumption of Regulatory Obligations_. From and after the
Closing Date, Parent shall be solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining
all Permits, waivers and approvals regarding the business of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as well as all ongoing regulatory
compliance relating thereto.

SECTION 5.15. _Stockholder Consent_. Promptly (and in event within one (1)
Business Day) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a copy of an irrevocable written consent of
the Sponsor representing not less than 90% of the outstanding Company Shares,
evidencing the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby with respect to such Shares held by the Sponsor (the " _Sponsor
Consent_ ").

SECTION 5.16. _Drag-Along Rights_. The Company shall, or shall cause the
Sponsor to, use commercially reasonable efforts to, as applicable (i) exercise
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement its rights under the Prism Shareholders Agreement to cause to
be delivered to the Company prior to the Closing Date a written stockholder
consent (or proxy, if applicable) adopting (or authorizing the proxy to
adopt, if applicable) this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
from each other holder of Company Shares who is a party to the Prism
Shareholders Agreement and who has not already delivered such a consent
(or proxy, if applicable) and (ii) exercise as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the execution and delivery of this Agreement its rights
under the Management Shareholders Agreements to cause to be delivered to the
Company prior to the Closing Date a written stockholder consent adopting this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby from each holder of Company
Shares who is a party to a Management Shareholders Agreement and who has not
already delivered such a consent;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in
exercising such rights neither the Company, the Sponsor nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall be required to assert any claim against, or file
or otherwise commence or pursue, any action, litigation or other proceeding
against, any holder of Company Shares or any of such

 



48  holders Affiliates; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that the Closing shall not be conditioned on the Company
delivering any written stockholder consent from the holders of Company
Shares, other than the Sponsor Consent. The Company shall deliver to Parent
copies of any written stockholder consents received by, or for which a proxy
is exercised by, the Company or the Sponsor prior to the Closing as
contemplated by this _Section 5.16_.

SECTION 5.17. _Alternative Transactions_. Company shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and its and their representatives to (A), immediately cease (i) any
and all discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent)
regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) furnishing to any Person (other than
Parent) any information with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; and (iii)
cooperating with, assisting in, participating in, facilitating or encouraging
an Acquisition Proposal and (B) withdraw the Companys Registration Statement
and immediately cease to take any actions in furtherance of a public offering
of capital stock of the Company. Until such time, if any, as this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company agrees that neither it
nor any of its Affiliates nor any of the officers and directors of it or its
Affiliates shall, and that it shall cause its and its Affiliates
representatives (including stockholders of the Company and its Subsidiaries)
not to, directly or indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of any Acquisition Proposal;
or (B) engage in any negotiations concerning, or enter into any agreement
regarding, an Acquisition Proposal or otherwise facilitate an Acquisition
Proposal.

SECTION 5.18. _Advice of Changes_. From and after the date hereof and until
the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing
of any event of which it or any Subsidiary gains Knowledge after the date
hereof that will result in any of the conditions set forth in _Section
6.02(a)_ or _(b)_ becoming incapable of being satisfied; _provided_ that the
failure to give such notice shall not be taken into account in determining
whether the conditions set forth in _Section 6.02(a)_ or _(b)_ have been
satisfied.

covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement, which inaccuracy,
breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of any of the

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with

Breach by a party of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements

enforce such award and accept damages for such breach, and Parent and Merger
Sub agree that such damages shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses
or out-of-pocket costs, and shall, in addition to any damage to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, include the benefit of the bargain lost by the
holders of Company Shares (taking into consideration all relevant matters,
including the loss of the expected premium, other combination opportunities

confidential information received by the parties shall be treated in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. 

(e) " _Intentional Breach_ " shall mean, with respect to any representation,
warranty, agreement or covenant, an action or omission (including a failure
to cure circumstances) taken or omitted to be taken that the breaching Person
intentionally takes (or fails to take) and knows (or should reasonably have

kind or description, whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources and their respective current,
former or future directors, officers, general or limited partners,

agents or other representatives in any way relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the Bond

(c) Parent Holdco hereby irrevocably designates Valeant Pharmaceuticals

c/o CT Corporation, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801, as its designee,
appointee and agent to receive, for and on their respective behalf service of
process in such jurisdiction in any legal action or proceedings with respect
to this Agreement or any other agreement executed in connection with this
Agreement, and such service shall be deemed complete upon delivery thereof to
the Process

 



58  Agent; _provided_ that, in the case of any such service upon the Process
Agent, the party effecting such service shall also deliver a copy thereof to
Parent Holdco. Parent Holdco shall take all such action as may be necessary
to continue said appointment in full force and effect or to appoint another
agent so that the Company will at all times have an agent for service of
process for the above purposes in New York, New York. In the event of the
transfer of all or substantially all of the assets and business of the Process
Agent to any other person or entity by consolidation, merger, sale of assets
or otherwise, such other person or entity shall be substituted hereunder for

Process Agent. Nothing herein shall affect the right of any party to serve
process in any other manner permitted by applicable law. Parent Holdco
expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is intended to be
irrevocable under the laws of the State of New York and of the United States
of America.

 

SECTION 8.10. _Counterparts, Etc._ This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of
which shall constitute one and the same agreement, and shall become effective
when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other party. Delivery of an executed counterpart of
a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile, email in "portable document
format" (".pdf") form, or by other electronic means intended to preserve the
original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the
same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original
signature.

SECTION 8.11. _Headings, Etc._  The provision of the Table of Contents, the
division of this Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions and
the insertion of headings are for convenience of reading only and shall not
affect or be utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All
references in this Agreement to any Article, Section, subsection or clause are
to the corresponding Article, Section, subsection or clause of this Agreement,
unless otherwise specified.

 

SECTION 8.12. _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, from time to time, at the request of any party hereto and,
except as otherwise set forth herein, at the expense of the party so
requesting, each other party shall execute and deliver to such requesting
party such documents and take such other action as such requesting party
may reasonably request in order to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

SECTION 8.13. _Remedies_. 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy expressly conferred hereby, and the exercise
by a party of any one such remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
such remedy.

 

(b) The parties understand and agree that the provisions of this Agreement are
uniquely related to the desire of the parties and their respective Affiliates
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, that the transactions
contemplated hereby represent a unique business opportunity at a unique time
for each of the parties hereto and their respective Affiliates and
further agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its terms
and further agree that, although

 



59  monetary damages may be available for the breach of such covenants and
undertakings, monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy therefor.
Accordingly, each party hereto agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any
provision of this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger
Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the terms and provisions of this
Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide, furnish or post any bond or other
security in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any such order or
injunction, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any right it may have to
require the provision, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other
security. In the event that any Litigation should be brought in equity to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege, and each
party hereto hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at
law.

(c) To the extent any party hereto brings an action, suit or proceeding to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (other than an action to enforce specifically any provision that
expressly survives termination of this Agreement) when expressly available to
such party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Termination Date shall
automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following
the resolution of such action, suit or proceeding or (ii) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action, suit or
proceeding. The parties acknowledge and agree that any extension of the
Termination Date pursuant to this _Section 8.13(c)_ shall be in addition to,
and shall not limit or otherwise prejudice, the ability of the Company to
extend the Termination Date pursuant to _Section 7.02(b)_.

SECTION 8.14. _Knowledge_. For purpose of this Agreement, (i) "knowledge" of
the Company means the actual knowledge of the persons listed on _Schedule
8.14(i)_ and such additional knowledge as could reasonably be expected to be
acquired by any such persons after reasonable inquiry and (ii) "knowledge" of
Parent or Merger Sub means the actual knowledge of the persons listed on
_Schedule 8.14(ii)_  and such additional knowledge as could reasonably be
expected to be acquired by any such persons after reasonable inquiry.

 

SECTION 8.15. _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein or otherwise, this Agreement may only be enforced against,
and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, may only be made
against the entities and Persons that are expressly identified as parties to
this Agreement in their capacities as such, and only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such party, and no
former, current or future direct or indirect stockholders, equity holders,
controlling persons, portfolio companies, directors, officers, employees,
general or limited partners, members, managers, trustees, attorneys, agents,
representatives or Affiliates of any party hereto, or any former, current or
future direct or indirect stockholder, equity holder, controlling person,
portfolio company, director, officer, employee, general or limited partner,
member, manager, trustee, attorney, agent, representative or Affiliate of any
of the foregoing

 



60  (each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_ ") shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim
(whether at law or in equity, in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any covenants, representations, warranties or statements (whether
written or oral, express or implied) made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. Without limiting the rights of any party against the other parties
hereto, in no event shall any party or any Person that would be a Non-Recourse
Party of such party seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims
for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages
from, any Non-Recourse Party (including any of the holders of the Company
Shares).

SECTION 8.16. _Certain Damages and Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, no party shall be liable for any consequential
damages, damages based upon loss of revenue, income or profits, loss or
diminution in value of assets or securities, loss of opportunity, damages
calculated by "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or other
valuation methodology, or punitive, special, exemplary or indirect damages,
in each case in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether at law or in equity, and whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein or otherwise, after the Closing, no party may seek to rescind this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

SECTION 8.17. _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Cleary Gottlieb has
acted as legal counsel to the Company, its Subsidiaries, certain of the
direct and indirect holders of Company Shares and certain of their respective
Affiliates prior to date hereof, and that Cleary Gottlieb intends to act as
legal counsel to certain of the direct and indirect holders of Company Shares
and their respective Affiliates (which will no longer include the Company and
its Subsidiaries) after the Closing, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates,
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to waive, any conflicts that
may arise in connection with Cleary Gottlieb representing any direct or
indirect holders of the Company Shares or their Affiliates after the Closing
as such representation may relate to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated
hereby. In addition, all communications involving attorney-client confidences
between direct and indirect holders of Company Shares, the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Cleary
Gottlieb, on the other hand, in the course of the negotiation, documentation
and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to
be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the direct and indirect
holders of Company Shares and their respective Affiliates (and not the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries).
Accordingly, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not have
access to any such communications or to the files of Cleary Gottlieb Steen
relating to such engagement from and after the Effective Time. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time,
(i) the direct and indirect holders of Company Shares and their respective
Affiliates (and not the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) shall be
the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such
engagement, and none of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries shall be
a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of Cleary Gottlieb in respect
of such engagement constitute property of the client, only the direct and
indirect holders of Company Shares and their respective Affiliates (and not
the Surviving Corporation and its

 



61  Subsidiaries) shall hold such property rights and (iii) Cleary Gottlieb
shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Cleary
Gottlieb and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise.
