of this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement. In addition, Orko will not
object to legal counsel to First Majestic making such submissions on the
hearing of the motion for the Interim Order and the application for the Final

regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no Party shall
issue any press release or otherwise make public announcements with respect
to this Agreement or the Arrangement without the consent of the other Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
provided, however, that the foregoing shall be subject to each PartyÂ’s
overriding obligation to make any disclosure required under applicable Laws,
and the Party making such disclosure shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to give prior oral or written notice to the other Party
and reasonable opportunity to review or comment on the disclosure, and if

      | (e)   |  

the order approving the Arrangement that is obtained from  the Court will
expressly state that the Arrangement is approved by the  Court as being fair

      | (f)   |

to the Arrangement will be given adequate notice  advising them of their
right to attend the hearing of the Court to give  approval of the Arrangement
and providing them with sufficient information  necessary for them to
exercise that right; and 

      |   | 
      | (g)   |  

the Interim Order will specify that each Person entitled  to First Majestic

Court so long as they enter an appearance within a  reasonable time.

no representation, warranty or covenant to any other party or to any
Orko Shareholder regarding the United States tax treatment of the
Arrangement, including, but not limited to, whether the Arrangement will
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
United States Internal Revenue Code or as a tax deferred transaction for
purposes of any United States state or local income tax Law.

 2.11  Canadian Tax Matters. The amalgamation of Orko with
Subco pursuant to the Arrangement is intended to qualify as an amalgamation
within the meaning of Section 87 of the ITA.

the date the Final Order is deposited at the registered office of Orko, which
shall be (a) the date that is the earlier of: (i) the date that is three
Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Laws)
of the conditions set forth in Article 5 (other than the delivery of items to
be delivered on the Effective Date and the satisfaction of those conditions
that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until immediately prior to the

Article 5, the Arrangement will, from and after the Effective Time, have all

which such qualification is being made), Orko hereby represents and warrants
to and in favour of First Majestic as follows and acknowledges that First
Majestic is relying on such representations and warranties in connection with

filing of annual returns or the equivalent. Orko and each of the Orko
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation or organization authorized to do business
in all jurisdictions in which the character of the properties owned, leased
or operated or the nature of the business conducted by it would make such
qualification or licensing necessary. No proceedings have been instituted or
are pending for the dissolution or liquidation of Orko or any Orko
Subsidiary. True and complete copies of the constating documents of Orko and
each Orko Subsidiary have been provided to First Majestic and no amendments
to such constating documents have been authorized. \- 21 -

        | (a)   |  

The authorized capital of Orko consists of an unlimited  number of Orko
Shares of which, as of the date hereof, 136,643,979 Orko  Shares are issued
and outstanding. No Orko Shares are held in treasury or  authorized or
reserved for issuance, other than upon the exercise of the  Orko Options that
are set forth in Schedule 3.1.2 of the Orko  Disclosure Letter. All
outstanding Orko Shares have been duly authorized  and are validly issued,
are fully paid and non-assessable and were issued  in compliance with the
articles of Orko and all applicable Laws. There  are, and have been, no
preemptive rights relating to the allotment or  issuance of any of the issued
and outstanding Orko Shares. As of the date  hereof, all Orko Options
outstanding are disclosed in Schedule   3.1.2 of the Orko Disclosure Letter,
no Person other than First  Majestic under this Agreement has any other
agreement, option, commitment,  arrangement, or any other right or privilege
(whether by law, pre-emptive  or contractual) capable of becoming an
agreement, option or commitment  (including any such right or privilege under
convertible securities,  warrants or convertible obligations of any nature)
for the purchase,  subscription, allotment or issuance of, or conversion
into, any of the  unissued shares or any other securities of Orko or the
purchase or other  acquisition from Orko of any of its undertakings, business
or  assets. 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

There are no outstanding bonds, debentures or other  evidences of
indebtedness of Orko having the right to vote (or that are  convertible for
or exercisable into securities having the right to vote)  with the holders of
the Orko Shares on any matter. 

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

Orko has not, since the date of its incorporation,  declared or paid any
dividends or made any other distributions (in either  case, in stock or
property) on any of its shares. 

 3.1.3 _Authority and No Violation._

        | (a)   |  

Orko has all requisite corporate power and authority to  enter into this

below in respect of which such qualification is being made), First Majestic
represents and warrants to and in favour of Orko as follows and acknowledges
that Orko is relying upon such representations and warranties in connection

respective jurisdiction of incorporation, is validly subsisting, has full
corporate or legal power and authority to own, lease and operate the
properties currently owned, leased and operated by it and to conduct its
business as currently conducted, and is in good standing with respect to the
filing of annual returns. First Majestic is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or organization
authorized to do business in all jurisdictions in which the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated or the nature of the business conducted
by it would make such qualification or licensing necessary. No proceedings
have been instituted or are pending for the dissolution or liquidation of
First Majestic or Subco.

 3.2.2 _Capitalization. _ The authorized share structure of
First Majestic consists of an unlimited number of First Majestic Shares, of
which, as of the date hereof, 116,761,513 First Majestic Shares were issued

pursuant to employment compensation plans and warrants to acquire an
aggregate of 338,295 First Majestic Shares, there are no options, warrants,
conversion privileges or other rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments (contingent or otherwise) obligating First Majestic to issue or
sell any shares or securities or obligations of any kind convertible into or
exchangeable for any shares of First Majestic. Other than First
Majestic Shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the options and
warrants referred to above, no First Majestic Shares are held in treasury or
authorized or reserved for issuance. There are no outstanding bonds,
debentures or other evidences of indebtedness of First Majestic having the
right to vote (or that are convertible for or exercisable into securities
having the right to vote) with the holders of the First Majestic Shares on
any matter. The First Majestic Shares to be issued pursuant to the
Arrangement will, when issued and delivered be duly and validly issued by
First Majestic on their respective dates of issue as fully paid and non-
assessable shares and will not be issued in violation of the terms of any
agreement or other understanding binding upon First Majestic at the time that
such shares are issued and will be issued in compliance with the constating

Majestic and Subco and the consummation by each of First Majestic  and Subco
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized 
by its respective board of directors and no other corporate proceedings on 
its part are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the transactions 
contemplated hereby other than the approval by its respective board of 
directors of other matters (if any) relating solely to the implementation  of
the Arrangement (and for greater certainty, the issuance of the First 
Majestic Shares pursuant to the Arrangement does not require the approval  of
any securityholders of First Majestic pursuant to applicable Laws or  stock
exchange policies, including the policies of the TSX or  NYSE). \- 44 -

terms, subject to  bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar Laws affecting

Adverse Effect on First Majestic, result in the imposition  of any

as and where it may be carried on in the future.

No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or  registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or other  Person is
required to be obtained by First Majestic or Subco in connection  with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by  First
Majestic and Subco of the transactions contemplated hereby other  than:

administrative nature and which could be completed or obtained  without
Material Adverse Effect on First Majestic immediately after the  Effective
Date or which, if not obtained, would not in the aggregate have  a Material
Adverse Effect on First Majestic. 

 3.2.4 _No Defaults._ Neither First Majestic nor any First
Majestic Material Subsidiary is in default under, and there exists no event,
condition or occurrence which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would

(except any such representation or warranty  which speaks as of a date prior
to the occurrence of such event), if made  on or as of the date of such event
or the Effective Date, untrue or  inaccurate in any material respect;

      |   |

 4.4 Covenants Regarding Non-Solicitation.

        | (a)   |  

Subject to Section 4.5, from the date of this  Agreement until the earlier of
the Effective Time or the time at which  this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, Orko shall not,  directly or indirectly, through
any officer, director, employee,  representative or agent of Orko or any Orko
Subsidiary: 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (i)   |

      |   | (iv)   |  

approve or recommend or propose publicly to approve or  recommend any

Proposal which has been publicly announced (it being  understood that

not be considered a violation of this section);  or 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (v)   |  

enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,  agreement,
arrangement or understanding related to any Acquisition  Proposal (except as
permitted by Section  4.4(d)). \- 56 -

 

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Section  4.4(a) and any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing shall prevent the Orko Board prior to
the Orko Meeting from considering, participating in any discussions or
negotiations, or entering into a confidentiality agreement and providing
information pursuant to Section 4.4(d), regarding an unsolicited _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal that did not otherwise result from a breach of
this Section 4.4 and that the Orko Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is reasonably
likely to constitute or lead to a Superior Proposal. Orko shall not consider,
negotiate, accept or recommend an Acquisition Proposal after the date of the
Orko Meeting. Orko shall, and shall cause its officers, directors
and employees and any financial advisors or other advisors, representatives
or agents retained by it, to cease immediately upon execution of this
Agreement all discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal. To the extent it has not already done so, Orko shall deny access to
all parties other than First Majestic and its advisors, employees and agents
to any and all data rooms which may have been opened. Orko shall immediately
request the return of all confidential non-public information provided to any
third parties (other than First Majestic and its advisors, employees and
agents) who have entered into a confidentiality agreement with Orko relating
to a potential Acquisition Proposal, shall use all reasonable efforts to
ensure that such requests are honoured and shall immediately advise First
Majestic orally and in writing of any responses or action (actual or
threatened) by any recipient of such request which could hinder, prevent,
delay or otherwise adversely affect the completion of the Arrangement.

        | (b)   |  

Orko shall not amend, modify, waive or fail to enforce on  a timely basis any
obligation under any confidentiality or standstill  agreement or amend any
such agreement or other conditions included in any  agreement between Orko
and a third party, except to allow such Person to  confidentially propose to
the Orko Board an unsolicited written  Acquisition Proposal (that did not
result from a breach of Section   4.4(a) by Orko or any of its
representatives) that the Orko Board  determines, after consultation with its
legal and financial advisors,  constitutes or is reasonably likely to
constitute or lead to a Superior  Proposal. 

      |   |   | 
      | (c)   |  

Orko shall promptly notify First Majestic, at first  orally and then in
writing, of any Acquisition Proposal and any enquiry  that may reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any  amendments to the
foregoing, or any request for non-public information  relating to Orko in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access  to the properties,
books or records of Orko by any Person that informs  Orko that it is
considering making, or has made, a proposal that  constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition  Proposal. Such notice shall
include a description of the material terms  and conditions of any proposal
and the identity of the Person making such  proposal, enquiry or contact, and
a copy of any written form of  Acquisition Proposal and any other documents
representing such Acquisition  Proposal. Orko shall: 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (i)   |  

keep First Majestic fully informed of the status  including any change to the
material terms of any such Acquisition  Proposal or enquiry; and 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (ii)   |  

provide to First Majestic as soon as practicable after  receipt or delivery
thereof with copies of all correspondence and other  written material sent or
provided to Orko from any Person in connection  with any Acquisition Proposal
or sent or provided by Orko to any Person in  connection with any Acquisition
Proposal. \- 57 -

        | (d)   |  

If Orko receives a request for material non-public  information from a Person
who has made an unsolicited _bona fide _ written Acquisition Proposal and
Orko is permitted, as contemplated  under the second sentence of Section
4.4(a) to negotiate the  terms of such Acquisition Proposal, then, and only
in such case, the Orko  Board may, subject to the execution by such Person of
a confidentiality  agreement on terms substantially similar to the
Confidentiality  Agreements, provide such Person with access to information
regarding Orko;  provided, however, that Orko sends a copy of any such
confidentiality  agreement to First Majestic promptly upon its execution and
concurrently  provides First Majestic with a list of or copies of the
information  provided to such Person and access to similar information which
was  provided to such Person. 

      |   | 
      | (e)   |  

Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the  termination of this
Agreement, Orko shall not, except with the prior  written consent of First
Majestic, take any action to terminate, amend,  extend the "Separation Time"
under or waive the Shareholder Rights Plan,  or the application of the
Shareholder Rights Plan to, any Acquisition  Proposal, or any Person making
an Acquisition Proposal, not subject to the  Shareholder Rights Plan
(including redemption of any rights created under  the Shareholder Rights
Plan) unless the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a  Superior Proposal and
Orko has complied with the provisions of Section   4.4 and Section 4.5 and
provided further that any such  termination, amendment, extension, waiver or
redemption cannot be  effective until after the Orko Meeting. In the event
that any Person  requests any Governmental Entity to invalidate or cease
trade the  Shareholder Rights Plan, Orko shall oppose any such application
unless the  Orko Board determines, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that  to do so is not consistent with its fiduciary duties. 

      |   | 
      | (f)   |  

Orko shall ensure that its officers, directors and  employees and any
financial advisors or other advisors, representatives or  agents retained by
it are aware of the provisions of this Section   4.4, and it shall be
responsible for any breach of this Section  4.4 by any such Person. 

 4.5 Notice by Orko of Superior Proposal Determination.

        | (a)   |  

Notwithstanding Section 4.4 Orko may accept,  approve, recommend or enter
into any agreement, understanding or  arrangement in respect of an
Acquisition Proposal if, and only  if: 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (i)   |  

Orko shall have complied with all of its other  obligations under Section
4.4; 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (ii)   |  

such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior  Proposal; 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (iii)   |  

the Orko Meeting has not occurred; 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (iv)   |  

Orko has provided First Majestic with: \- 58 -

        | (A)   |  

a copy of the Superior Proposal document and any other  documents
representing the Superior Proposal; 

      |   | 
      | (B)   |  

written notice advising First Majestic of the  determination of the Orko
Board that the Acquisition Proposal is a  Superior Proposal and that the Orko
Board has resolved, subject only to  compliance with this Section 4.5 and
termination of this  Agreement, to accept, approve, recommend or enter into
an agreement in  respect of such Superior Proposal, specifying the terms and
conditions of  such Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making such
Superior  Proposal; and 

      |   | 
      | (C)   |  

written notice from the Orko Board regarding the value or  range of values in
financial terms that the Orko Board has, in  consultation with its financial
advisors, determined should be ascribed to  any non-cash consideration
offered under the Superior  Proposal; 

 
        | (v)   |  

five Business Days shall have elapsed from the date First  Majestic received
the documentation referred to in Section 4.5(a)(iv) (the  "Match Period");
and 

      |   |   | 
      | (vi)   |  

Orko has previously or concurrently will have: 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (A)   |  

paid to First Majestic the Termination Payment, if any,  payable under
Section 6.3; and 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (B)   |  

terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section  6.2. 

 

Any information provided by Orko to First Majestic pursuant to this Section
4.5 or pursuant to Section 4.4 shall be subject to the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreements.

        | (b)   |  

During the Match Period Orko agrees that First Majestic  shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms  of this Agreement
and Orko shall co-operate with First Majestic with  respect thereto,
including negotiating in good faith with First Majestic  during the Match
Period. The Orko Board will review any offer by First  Majestic to amend the
terms of this Agreement in order to determine, in  good faith, whether First
MajesticÂ’s offer upon acceptance by Orko would  result in such Acquisition
Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal. If  the Orko Board so determines,
it will enter into an amended agreement with  First Majestic reflecting First
MajesticÂ’s amended proposal and will,  within two Business Days of entering
into such amendment, reaffirm its  recommendation of the Arrangement and
issue a press release to that  effect. If the Orko Board continues to
believe, in good faith and after  consultation with financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that such  Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior
Proposal and therefore rejects  First MajesticÂ’s amended proposal, Orko may
terminate this Agreement  pursuant to Section 6.2(a)(iv); provided, however,
that Orko must  concurrently therewith pay to First Majestic the Termination
Payment, if  any, payable to First Majestic under Section 6.3 and must 
prior to or concurrently with such termination enter into a  binding
agreement, understanding or arrangement with respect to such  Acquisition
Proposal. Orko acknowledges and agrees that payment of the  Termination
Payment, if any, payable under Section 6.3 is a  condition to valid
termination of this Agreement under Section 6.2(a)(iv) and this Section 4.5. \- 59 -

        | (c)   |  

The Orko Board shall promptly reaffirm its recommendation  of the Arrangement
by press release: (i) after any Acquisition Proposal  (which is determined
not to be a Superior Proposal) is publicly announced  or made; (ii) after the
Orko Board determines that a proposed amendment to  the provisions of this
Agreement would result in the Acquisition Proposal  not being a Superior
Proposal; or (iii) as soon as practicable after  receipt of any reasonable
request from First Majestic to do so. First  Majestic and its legal advisor
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to  review and comment on the form
and content of any such press release and  Orko shall incorporate all
reasonable comments made by First Majestic and  its counsel. Such press
release shall state that the Orko Board has  determined that such Acquisition
Proposal is not a Superior  Proposal. 

      |   |  



    |   | (d)   |  

If, less than six Business Days before the Orko Meeting,  Orko has provided
First Majestic with a notice under Section   4.5(a)(iv), an Acquisition
Proposal has been publicly disclosed  or announced and the Match Period has
not elapsed, then, subject to  applicable Laws, at First MajesticÂ’s request,
Orko will postpone or  adjourn the Orko Meeting to a date acceptable to First
Majestic and Orko,  acting reasonably, which shall not be less than five
Business Days and not  more than 10 Business Days after the scheduled date of
the Orko Meeting  and shall, in the event that First Majestic and Orko amend
the terms of  this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.5, ensure that the 
details of such amended Agreement are communicated to the Orko 
Securityholders at or prior to the resumption of the adjourned Orko  Meeting. 

      |   |  


 
      | (e)   |  

Orko acknowledges and agrees that each successive  modification to any
material terms or conditions of any Acquisition  Proposal or that results in
an increase in or modification of the  consideration (or value of such
consideration) to be received by Orko or  the Orko Shareholders or which
otherwise results in the Orko Board  determining that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal shall  constitute a new Acquisition Proposal
for purposes of the requirement  under Section 4.5(a)(v) to initiate an
additional five Business  Day notice period. 

      |   |  


 
      | (f)   |  

Nothing contained in this Section 4.5 shall prohibit the  Orko Board from: 

  
        | (i)   |  

responding through a directorsÂ’ circular or otherwise as  required by Law to
an Acquisition Proposal that it determines is not a  Superior Proposal,
provided that Orko shall provide First Majestic and its  outside legal
counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review the form and  content of such
circular or other disclosure and provided that such  circular or other
disclosure recommends that Orko Shareholders reject such  Acquisition
Proposal; or \- 60 -

        | (ii)   |  

calling and/or holding a meeting of Orko Shareholders  requisitioned by Orko
Shareholders in accordance with the Business  Corporations Act or taking any
other action with respect to an Acquisition  Proposal to the extent ordered
or otherwise mandated by a court of  competent jurisdiction in accordance
with Law and provided that any  information circular or other document
required in connection with such  meeting recommends that Orko Shareholders
vote against any proposed  resolution in favour of or necessary to complete
such Acquisition  Proposal.

Confidentiality Agreements and applicable Laws, upon reasonable notice, Orko

data relating to Orko and the Orko Subsidiaries which First Majestic or its
Representatives deem necessary or advisable to review in making an
examination of Orko, the Orko Subsidiaries and the Business, as well as to
its management personnel, and, during such period, Orko shall furnish
promptly to First Majestic all information concerning Orko, the Orko
Subsidiaries and their respective Business, properties and personnel as First

efforts to ensure that the representations and warranties given by it and

in Schedule 4.8 to the Orko Disclosure Letter, and  any directorsÂ’ and

Orko and any Orko Subsidiary shall survive the  completion of the Arrangement
(or be replaced with substantially  equivalent coverage from another provider
of at least equivalent  standing to the current provider) and shall continue
in full force and  effect (either directly or via run-off insurance or
insurance provided by  an alternative provider of at least equivalent
standing to the current  provider) for a period of not less than six years
from the Effective Date  and First Majestic undertakes to ensure that this
covenant shall remain  binding upon its successor and assigns. First Majestic

      | (c)   |  

First Majestic acknowledges and agrees that Orko may  enter into
indemnification agreements with each director and officer of  Orko and each
of the Orko Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Date, such  agreements to be

agrees that from and after the Effective Date  it will cause Orko to honour
all rights to indemnification or exculpation  in such agreements in favour of
present and former officers and directors  of Orko and acknowledges that such
rights will survive the Effective Date  and will continue in full force and
effect for a period of not less than  six years from the Effective Date. 

      |   | 
      | (d)   |  

First Majestic and Orko shall use all commercially  reasonable efforts to

for a material default by First Majestic in complying with its obligations
hereunder.

 5.3 Additional Conditions Precedent to the Obligations

Effective Date, of each of the following conditions precedent (each of which

understood that, for the purposes of determining the  accuracy of such
representations and warranties, all "Material Adverse  Effect" qualifications
and other materiality qualifications contained in  such representations and
warranties shall be disregarded) as of the date  of this Agreement and as of
Effective Date as if made on and as of such  date (except to the extent such
representations and warranties speak as of  a specified date which is earlier
than the date of this Agreement, in  which event such representations and
warranties shall be true and correct  in all respects as of such earlier
specified date, or except as affected  by transactions contemplated or
permitted by this Agreement), except where  any failure or failures of such
representations and warranties to be so  true and correct would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably  be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on First Majestic, and  Orko shall have received a
certificate of First Majestic addressed to Orko  and dated the Effective
Date, signed on behalf of First Majestic by two  senior executive officers of
First Majestic confirming the same as at the  Effective Date; 

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

between the date hereof and the Effective Date, there  shall not have
occurred, in the judgment of Orko, acting reasonably, a  Material Adverse
Change to First Majestic; and

necessary resolutions, and all other necessary corporate  action shall have

Arrangement. 

 

Orko may not rely on the failure to satisfy any of the above conditions
precedent as a basis for non-compliance by Orko with its obligations under
this Agreement if the condition precedent would have been satisfied but for a
material default by Orko in complying with its obligations hereunder.

 5.4  Notice and Cure Provisions. Each Party will give
prompt notice to the other of the occurrence, or failure to occur, at any
time from the date hereof until the Effective Date, of any event or state of
facts which occurrence or failure would, or would be reasonably likely to:

        | (a)   |  

cause any of the representations or warranties of such  Party contained
herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect  between the date
hereof and the Effective Date; 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

result in the failure to comply with or satisfy any  covenant or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by such Party  hereunder prior to the Effective
Date; or 

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

result in the failure to satisfy any of the conditions  precedent in favour
of the other Party hereto contained in Section   5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, as the
case may  be. \- 66 -

 

Subject as herein provided, a Party may elect not to complete the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the conditions
precedent contained in Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 in favour of such Party, or
exercise any termination right arising therefrom, if forthwith, and in any
event prior to the Effective Date, such Party has delivered a written notice
to the other specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of
covenants, representations and warranties or other matters which the Party
delivering such notice is asserting as the basis for the non-fulfillment of
the applicable condition precedent or the exercise of the termination right,
as the case may be. If any such notice is delivered and the Party receiving
such notice is proceeding diligently to cure such matter, if such matter is
susceptible to being cured, the Party delivering such notice may not
terminate this Agreement until the earlier of the Outside Date and the
expiration of a period of ten Business Days from such notice. If such notice
has been delivered prior to the date of the Orko Meeting, such meeting shall
be postponed until the expiry of such period. If such notice has been
delivered prior to the making of the application for the Final Order, such
application shall be postponed until the expiry of such period. For greater
certainty, in the event that such matter is cured within the time period
referred to herein, this Agreement may not be terminated as a result of such
matter.

 5.5  Satisfaction of Conditions. The conditions
precedent set out in Sections  5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 shall be conclusively deemed
to have been satisfied, waived or released when, with the approval of First
Majestic and Orko, the Arrangement is completed.

time to time before or after the holding of the Orko Meeting but not later

subject to Section 5.4, the other Party is in default of  a covenant or
obligation hereunder such that the condition contained in  Section 5.2(a) or

Agreement so as to cause any condition in  favour of all Parties or in favour
of the other Party not to be satisfied;  or

      | (C)   |  

subject to Section 5.4, any representation or warranty of  the other Party

representations or warranties or the failure of such  Party to perform any of
its covenants or agreements under this  Agreement; 

 
        | (iii)   |

If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the  foregoing provisions
of this Section 6.2, no Party shall have any  further liability to perform
its obligations hereunder, except as provided  for in Section 6.3, which
shall survive the termination of this  Agreement or as otherwise contemplated
hereby, and provided that, subject  to Section 6.5, neither the termination
of this Agreement nor  anything contained in this Section 6.2(b) shall
relieve any Party  from any liability for any breach by it of this Agreement,
including from  any inaccuracy in its representations and warranties and
any  non-performance by it of its covenants made herein.

      | (v)   |  

in the case of a termination specified in clauses (ii)  through (iv), within
five Business Days after written notice of  termination by First Majestic; or 

      |   | 
      | (vi)   |  

in the case of a termination specified in clause (v),  within five Business
Days after consummation of an Acquisition  Proposal, 

 
      (b)   |  

For greater certainty, Orko shall not be obligated to  make more than one
payment pursuant to Section 6.3(a). \- 69 -

        | (c)   |  

If First Majestic shall terminate this Agreement pursuant  to Section
6.2(a)(ii)(B) or 6.2(a)(ii)(D) where Orko is in default of a  covenant or
obligation hereunder so as to cause any condition in favour of  First
Majestic not to be satisfied, provided First Majestic is not in  default of a
covenant or obligation hereunder so as to cause any condition  in favour of
both Parties or in favour of Orko not to be satisfied, then  Orko shall pay
to First Majestic an expense reimbursement fee of  $1,500,000 within five
Business Days after written notice of termination  by First Majestic. 

      |   | 
      | (d)   |  

If Orko shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to  Section 6.2(a)(ii)(B) or
6.2(a)(ii)(D) where First Majestic is in  default of a covenant or obligation
hereunder so as to cause any condition  in favour of Orko not to be
satisfied, provided Orko is not in default of  a covenant or obligation
hereunder so as to cause any condition in favour  of both Parties or in
favour of First Majestic not to be satisfied, then  First Majestic shall pay
to Orko an expense reimbursement fee of  $1,500,000 within five Business Days
after written notice of termination  by Orko. 

 6.4 Liquidated Damages. Orko acknowledges that the
damages set forth in this Article 6 are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages
First Majestic will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to
those damages and are not penalties. Orko irrevocably waives any right it may
have to raise as a defence in any proceedings that any such damages are
excessive, punitive or abusive.

 6.5 Remedies. Subject to Section 6.6, the Parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that an award of money damages would be
inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by any Party or its
representatives and any such breach would cause the non-breaching Party
irreparable harm. Accordingly, the Parties hereto agree that, in the event of
any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by one of the Parties, the
non-breaching Party will also be entitled, without the requirement of posting
a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief
and specific performance. Such remedies will not be the exclusive remedies
for any breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all other
remedies available at law or equity to the Parties.

 6.6 Effect of Termination Payment. For greater
certainty, the Parties agree that the payment of the amount pursuant to
Section 6.3 is the sole monetary remedy as a result of the occurrence of any
of the events referred to in Section 6.3. Subject to the immediately preceding
sentence, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude a Party from seeking
damages in respect of losses incurred or suffered by such Party as a result
of any breach of this Agreement by the other Party, seeking injunctive relief
to restrain any breach or threatened breach of the covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreements or otherwise,
or seeking specific performance of any of such covenants or agreements,
without the necessity of posting bond or security in connection therewith. \- 70 -

Majestic shall deliver or arrange to be delivered to  the Depositary the
Share Consideration, including certificates  representing the First Majestic
Shares required to be issued to the Orko  Shareholders in accordance with
Section 2.3 hereof, which certificates  shall be held by the Depositary as
agent and nominee for such former Orko  Shareholders for distribution to such
former Orko Shareholders in  accordance with the provisions of Article 4
hereof. 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

Subject to the provisions of Article 4 hereof, and upon  return of a properly
completed Letter of Transmittal by a registered  former Orko Shareholder
together with certificates, if any, which,  immediately prior to the
Effective Date, represented Orko Shares and such  other documents as the

receive  delivery of the certificates representing the First Majestic Shares
and  cheques representing the cash to which they are entitled pursuant to 
Section 2.3(d). \- 8 -

        | (c)   |

provision of provincial income tax law) (a "Section 85  Election") with
respect to the exchange by providing the necessary  information in accordance
with the procedures set out in the tax  instruction letter on or before the
date 90 days after the Effective Date.  Neither Orko, First Majestic nor any
successor corporation shall be  responsible for the proper completion of any
election form nor, except for  the obligation to sign and return duly
completed election forms which are  received within 90 days of the Effective
Date, for any taxes, interest or  penalties resulting from the failure of an
Eligible Holder to properly  complete or file such election forms in the form
and manner and within the  time prescribed by the ITA (or any applicable
provincial legislation). In  its sole discretion, First Majestic or any
successor corporation may  choose to sign and return an election form
received by it more than 90  days following the Effective Date, but will have

      |   | 
      | (d)   |

cent, the consideration payable shall be rounded down to the nearest whole
cent.

 2.6 No Fractional First Majestic Shares.In no event
shall any holder of Orko Shares be entitled to a fractional First Majestic
Share. Where the aggregate number of First Majestic Shares to be issued to a
former Orko Shareholder as consideration under this Arrangement would result
in a fraction of a First Majestic Share being issuable, the number of First
Majestic Shares to be received by such Orko Shareholder shall be rounded down
to the nearest whole First Majestic Share. 

 2.7  Adjustments to the Exchange Ratio.The Exchange
Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into First Majestic Shares, other than stock dividends
paid in lieu of ordinary course dividends), consolidation, reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to First Majestic Shares
occurring after the date of the Arrangement Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time. \- 9 -

        | (b)   |  

are ultimately entitled to be paid fair value for their  Orko Shares shall be
deemed to have transferred such Orko Shares to First  Majestic as of the
Effective Time without any further act or formality and  free and clear of
all liens, claims and encumbrances, in consideration for  the payment by
First Majestic of the fair value thereof, in cash;  or 

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

are ultimately not entitled, for any reason, to be paid  fair value for their
Orko Shares shall be deemed to have participated in  the Arrangement on the
same basis as a non-dissenting holder of Orko  Shares and shall receive Share
Consideration on the basis determined in  accordance with Section 2.3(d); 

 

but in no case shall First Majestic, Orko or any other Person be required to
recognize such Persons as holders of Orko Shares after the Effective Time,
and the names of such Persons shall be deleted from the registers of holders
of Orko Shares at the Effective Time.

ARTICLE 4 
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND DELIVERY OF CASH

      4.1   |  

Delivery of First Majestic Shares and Cash.Upon  surrender to the Depository
for cancellation of a certificate that  immediately before the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding  Orko Shares that were exchanged for the
Share Consideration in accordance  with Section 2.3(d) hereof together with
such other documents and  instruments as would have been required to effect
the transfer of the Orko  Shares formerly represented by such certificate
under the Business  Corporations Act and the articles of Orko and such
additional documents  and instruments as the Depository may reasonably
require, the holder of  such surrendered certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange  therefor, and the Depository shall deliver to such
holder following  the Effective Time, a certificate representing the First
Majestic Shares  and a cheque representing the cash that such holder is
entitled to receive  in accordance with Section 2.3(d) hereof. \- 10 -

        | (b)   |  

After the Effective Time and until surrendered for  cancellation as
contemplated by Section 4.1(a) hereof, each certificate  that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented one or more Orko  Shares shall be
deemed at all times to represent only the right to receive  in exchange
therefor the Share Consideration that the holder of such  certificate is
entitled to receive in accordance with Section 2.3(d)  hereof. 

 4.2  Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered
Certificates.No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to First Majestic Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Orko Shares that were exchanged pursuant to Section 2.3 unless
and until the holder of record of such certificate shall surrender such
certificate in accordance with Section 4.1. Subject to applicable law, at the
time of such surrender of any such certificate (or in the case of clause (ii)
below, at the appropriate payment date), there shall be paid to the holder of
record of the certificates formerly representing whole Orko Shares, without
interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole First Majestic Share and (ii) on the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such whole First Majestic Share.

 4.3 Lost Certificates.In the event any certificate
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one or more
outstanding Orko Shares that were exchanged pursuant to Section 2.3(d) shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Depositary will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, one or more certificates representing one or more First Majestic
Shares (and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto) deliverable
in accordance with such holderÂ’s Letter of Transmittal. When authorizing such
payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Person
to whom certificates representing First Majestic Shares are to be issued
shall, as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, give a bond
satisfactory to First Majestic and its transfer agent in such sum as First
Majestic may direct or otherwise indemnify First Majestic in a manner
satisfactory to First Majestic against any claim that may be made against
First Majestic with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

 4.4 Extinction of Rights.Any certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Orko Shares
that were exchanged pursuant to Section 2.3(d) and not deposited, with all
other instruments required by Section 4.1 on or prior to the third
anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to represent a claim or
interest of any kind or nature as a shareholder of First Majestic. On such
date, the First Majestic Shares to which the former registered holder of the
certificate referred to in the preceding sentence was ultimately
entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered to First Majestic together
with all entitlements to dividends, distributions and interest thereon held
for such former registered holder. None of First Majestic, Orko or
the Depositary shall be liable to any person in respect of any First Majestic
Shares (or dividends, distributions and interest in respect thereof)
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. \- 11 -

 4.5 Withholding and Sale Rights.Each of First Majestic
and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from (i) any
First Majestic Shares or other consideration otherwise issuable or payable
pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement to any holder of Orko Shares, or (ii)
any dividend or consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Orko Shares
or First Majestic Shares such amounts as First Majestic or the Depositary,
respectively, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such
issuance or payment, as the case may be, under the ITA, the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code or any provision of provincial, state, local or foreign
tax law, in each case as amended. To the extent that the amount so required
to be deducted or withheld from the First Majestic Shares, dividends or
consideration otherwise issuable or payable to a holder exceeds the cash
portion of the consideration otherwise payable to such holder, each of First
Majestic and the Depositary is hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose
of, at such times and at such prices as it determines, in its sole
discretion, such portion of the First Majestic Shares otherwise issuable or
payable to such holder as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to First
Majestic or the Depositary, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with
such deduction or withholding requirement, and shall notify the holder
thereof and remit to such holder any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of
such sale or disposition (after deducting applicable sale commissions and any
other reasonable expenses relating thereto) in lieu of the First Majestic
Shares or other consideration so sold or disposed of. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld or First Majestic Shares or other consideration are
so sold or disposed of, such withheld amounts, or shares or other
consideration so sold or disposed of, shall be treated for all purposes
as having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such
deduction, withholding, sale or disposition was made, provided that such
withheld amounts, or the net proceeds of such sale or disposition, as the
case may be, are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.
Neither of First Majestic or the Depositary shall be obligated to seek or
obtain a minimum price for any of the First Majestic Shares or other
consideration sold or disposed of by it hereunder, nor shall any of them be
liable for any loss arising out of any such sale or disposition.

 4.6 Paramountcy.From and after the Effective Time:

        | (a)   |

Orko Shares and Orko Options issued prior to the  Effective Time; and 

      |   |
