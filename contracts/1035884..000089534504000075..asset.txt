expressly provided, for purposes of this Purchase Agreement,  the following

          Calculation of Time Period.  When  calculating the period of time
     before which, within which or following which any act is to be done or
     step taken pursuant to this Purchase  Agreement,  the date that is the
     reference  date in calculating  such period shall be excluded.  If the
     last day of such period is a non-Business  Day, the period in question
     shall end on the next succeeding Business Day.

          Gender and Number.  Any reference in this  Purchase  Agreement to
     gender shall  include all genders,  and words  imparting  the singular
     number only shall include the plural and vice versa.

          Headings.  The provision of a Table of Contents,  the division of
     this Purchase Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions
     and the insertion of headings are for  convenience  of reference  only
     and shall not affect or be utilized in construing or interpreting this
     Purchase



                                     13
<PAGE>

     Agreement.  All references in this Purchase Agreement to any "Article"
     or  "Section"  are to the  corresponding  Article  or  Section of this
     Purchase Agreement unless otherwise specified.

          Herein. The words such as "herein,"  "hereinafter," "hereof," and
     "hereunder" refer to this Purchase Agreement as a whole and not merely
     to a  subdivision  in which  such  words  appear  unless  the  context
     otherwise requires.

          Including.  The word  "including" or any variation  thereof means
     "including,  without  limitation"  and shall not be construed to limit
     any general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items
     or matters immediately following it.

          Payments and Computations. Except for the payment of the Purchase
     Price (which shall be paid at the Closing), each party shall make each
     payment due to another party to this Purchase Agreement not later than
     1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day when due. All payments shall
     be measured and paid in U.S.  dollars by wire transfer in  immediately
     available  funds to the  account or accounts  designated  by the party
     receiving  such  payment.  Whenever  any payment  under this  Purchase
     Agreement  shall  be due on a day  other  than a  Business  Day,  such
     payment  shall be made on the next  succeeding  Business Day, and such
     extension of time shall be included in the  computation  of payment of
     interest, if applicable.

          Schedules  and Exhibits.  The Schedules and Exhibits  attached to
     this  Purchase  Agreement  shall be construed  with and as an integral
     part of this Purchase  Agreement to the same extent as if the same had
     been set forth verbatim herein. To the extent  reasonably  apparent on
     its face,  disclosure  by Seller on any one Schedule of this  Purchase
     Agreement  shall be deemed  disclosed  for the  purposes  of all other
     Schedules to which the  disclosure  is relevant.  Notwithstanding  the
     foregoing,  if a word or phrase defined in this Purchase  Agreement is
     given a different  meaning in any Schedule or Exhibit,  such different
     definition  shall apply only to the Schedule or Exhibit  defining that
     word or  phrase  independently,  and the  meaning  given  that word or
     phrase in this Purchase  Agreement  shall control for purposes of this
     Purchase Agreement, and such alternative meaning shall have no bearing
     or effect,  on the  interpretation  of this Purchase  Agreement or any
     Schedule of this Purchase Agreement.

          Reasonable  Best  Efforts.  The  obligation  of a  party  to  use
     reasonable  best efforts to accomplish an objective does not require a
     material  expenditure  of  funds  or  the  incurrence  of  a  material
     liability on the part of the obligated party.

to Closing  representing a number of shares (the "Parent Shares") of common
stock,  par  value  $0.01 per  share,  of Parent  ("Parent  Common  Stock")
determined as follows: if the average per share closing price of the Parent
Common  Stock,  as  reported  on the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  Composite
Transactions  Tape (as  reported  by The  Wall  Street  Journal  (Northeast
Edition)),  or if not reported thereby, by any other authoritative  source)
for the ten (10)  trading days  immediately  prior to the trading day prior
the Closing Date ("Average Price") is (a) not less than $10.00 and not more
than $13.00, then the number of Parent Shares shall be equal to Thirty-Four
Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars  ($34,900,000) divided by the Average
Price;  (b) less than  $10.00,  then the number of Parent  Shares  shall be
equal to 3,490,000 shares of Parent Common Stock; and (c) more than $13.00,
then the  number of Parent  Shares  shall be equal to  2,684,615  shares of
Parent  Common  Stock,  and (iii) as  subject  to  adjustment  pursuant  to
Sections 2.4, 5.4(j),  5.4(r) and 8.4, deliver to Seller a convertible note
in  the   aggregate   principal   amount  of   Eighteen   Million   Dollars
($18,000,000),  the  summary  terms of which  are set  forth on  Exhibit  G
attached hereto (the "Convertible Note" and, together with the Cash Payment
and the Parent Shares, collectively, the "Purchase Price").

     2.4 Adjustment of Cash Payment; IT Transfer Costs.

          (a)  Estimated  Closing Net Assets.  No later than five  Business
Days prior to the  Closing  Date,  Seller  shall  deliver to Buyer its good
faith  estimate  (including  reasonable  supporting  documentation)  of the
Closing Net Assets of the Business, as defined and calculated in accordance
with Schedule  2.4(a) as of the close of business on the Business Day prior
to the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Net Assets").  If the Estimated
Closing  Net Assets are less than the Closing  Net Assets  Threshold,  then
such  shortfall  shall  first  reduce the amount of the  Convertible  Note,
dollar for dollar,  and



                                     17
<PAGE>

to the extent the amount of the  Convertible  Note is reduced to zero,  any
remaining  shortfall shall reduce the Cash Payment,  dollar for dollar.  If
the  Estimated  Closing  Net  Assets are more than the  Closing  Net Assets
Threshold  then such excess shall  increase  the amount of the  Convertible
Note, dollar for dollar.

          (b)  Post-Closing  Statement.  As soon as practicable  but in any
event  within 60 days after the  Closing  Date,  Parent will cause Buyer to
prepare (or cause to be  prepared)  and deliver to Seller a statement  (the
"Post-Closing  Statement")  showing (i) Buyer's  calculation of the Closing
Net Assets of the Business as defined on and calculated in accordance  with
Schedule  2.4(a) as of the close of business on the  Business  Day prior to
the Closing  Date,  including,  in each case,  the  calculation  thereof in
reasonable detail and (ii) the aggregate costs of all license, transfer and
assumption  fees paid or payable (to the extent  Buyer  determines,  in its
discretion, that it requires such license, transfer or assumption) by Buyer
in order to license, on substantially similar terms and conditions as those
binding  Seller,  all  Software  (as defined in the  Technology  Assignment
Agreement  attached  hereto as Exhibit C-5)  currently used in the Business
that is not assigned or  transferred  under this  Purchase  Agreement  ("IT
Transfer  Costs") at no additional  charge;  provided,  however,  that such
costs  shall not include any  amounts  paid or payable  for  Software  that
constitutes an upgrade from that utilized in the Business  (provided  that,
if the version  currently used in the Business is no longer available from,
or is being phased out by, the applicable vendor, the costs associated with
any such  upgrade  shall  be  included  up to the  amount  of the  original
purchase  price of the Software  being  replaced).  Buyer shall  provide to
Seller such back-up or supporting  data relating to the  preparation of the
Post-Closing  Statement and the  calculations  of Closing Net Assets and IT
Transfer Costs reflected  thereon as Seller may reasonably  request.  Buyer
shall  also  provide,   and  cause  its   representatives  to  provide,  as
applicable,  Seller and its accountants and other representatives with such
reasonable  access  to  the  books,  records,  files,  working  papers  and
personnel of Buyer or its  representatives,  as  applicable,  at reasonable
times and upon reasonable  notice, as Seller may reasonably request for the
purposes of evaluating the  Post-Closing  Statement and the calculations of
Closing Net Assets and IT Transfer Costs reflected thereon.

          (c) Acceptance Period;  Delivery of Dispute Notice. Seller shall,
within the 30 day period  following  receipt  thereby of such  Post-Closing
Statement  (the  "Acceptance  Period"),   notify  Buyer  of  acceptance  or
non-acceptance,  as the case may be, of the Post-Closing  Statement and the
calculation of Closing Net Assets and IT Transfer Costs reflected  thereon.
If no such notice is  delivered  to Buyer by Seller  within the  Acceptance
Period,  the  Post-Closing  Statement and the  calculations  of Closing Net
Assets and IT Transfer Costs reflected thereon shall be deemed to have been
accepted  by Seller  and shall be binding  upon all of the  parties to this
Purchase Agreement for all purposes of this Purchase  Agreement.  If Seller
gives  notice (a "Dispute  Notice") to Buyer within the  Acceptance  Period
that  Seller  does  not  agree  with  or  otherwise  does  not  accept  the
calculation  of the Closing Net Assets and IT Transfer  Costs  reflected in
the Post-Closing Statement, Seller shall describe in such Dispute Notice in
reasonable  detail,  the  nature of any  disagreement,  identify  the items
involved  and the  dollar  amount of each  such  disagreement  and  provide
reasonable supporting documentation for each disagreement. Buyer and Seller
shall endeavor in good faith to resolve all disagreements within the 30 day
period (the "Negotiating  Period") following the delivery by Seller of such
Dispute Notice.

          (d)  Determination  of Disputes by Neutral  Accounting  Firm.  If
Buyer and  Seller are unable to resolve  any  disagreements  regarding  the
Post-Closing  Statement and the calculations  reflected  thereon within the
Negotiating  Period,  then, upon the expiration of the Negotiating  Period,
any remaining  disputes may at any time be referred for resolution,  at the
election  of either  Seller or  Buyer,  to Ernst & Young LLP or such  other
internationally  recognized  accounting firm that is mutually acceptable to
Buyer and Seller (the "Neutral  Accounting  Firm").  The Neutral Accounting
Firm shall  investigate only those items which are in dispute and shall not
assign a value to any item that is (i) greater than the greatest  value for
such item  claimed  by either  of Buyer or  Seller or (ii)  lower  than the
lowest  value for such item  claimed  by  either  of Buyer or  Seller.  The
Neutral Accounting Firm's determination shall be based only



                                     18
<PAGE>

upon written  submissions by Buyer and Seller,  and not upon an independent
review by the Neutral  Accounting  Firm.  The Parties  shall  instruct  the
Neutral  Accounting Firm to render its determination  within 30 days of the
referral  of such  matter  thereto,  and the  determination  of the Neutral
Accounting  Firm  shall be final  and  binding  upon  all  parties  to this
Purchase  Agreement  for all purposes of this Purchase  Agreement.  Neither
Seller nor Buyer shall have any ex parte  communications  or meetings  with
the Neutral Accounting Firm without the prior consent of Buyer (in the case
of Seller) or Seller (in the case of Buyer).  The fees and  expenses of the
Neutral  Accounting  Firm shall be paid by the party whose  calculation  or
estimate of disputed  items on an aggregate  basis  represents the greatest
difference from the Neutral Accounting Firm's  determination of those items
on an aggregate basis.

          (e) Adjustment. Promptly following the final determination of the
Closing  Net  Assets,  but  in  no  event  more  than  five  Business  Days
thereafter,  (i) if the  amount  of the  Closing  Net  Assets  exceeds  the
Estimated  Closing Net Assets,  then the aggregate  principal amount of the
Convertible Note shall be adjusted upward,  dollar for dollar,  by any such
excess or (ii) if the  amount of the  Closing  Net  Assets is less than the
Estimated  Closing Net Assets,  then the aggregate  principal amount of the
Convertible Note shall be reduced, dollar for dollar, and to the extent the
amount of the  Convertible  Note is  reduced to zero,  Seller  shall pay to
Buyer by wire transfer of  immediately  available  funds to such account or
accounts as Buyer may  designate  to Seller in writing,  an amount equal to
such difference. For the purposes of this Purchase Agreement,  "Closing Net
Assets  Threshold" means the amount set forth on Schedule 2.4(a).  Promptly
following the final determination of the IT Transfer Costs, but in no event
more than five Business Days  thereafter,  if the IT Transfer  Costs exceed
Two Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars  ($2,200,000),  then the aggregate
principal  amount of the  Convertible  Note  shall be  reduced,  dollar for
dollar by the  amount of such  excess,  and to the extent the amount of the
Convertible  Note is  reduced  to zero,  Seller  shall pay to Buyer by wire
transfer  of  immediately  available  funds to such  account or accounts as
Buyer  may  designate  to  Seller  in  writing,  an  amount  equal  to such
difference.  Any  amounts  paid under  this  Section  2.4(e)  shall be paid
together with  interest  thereon at the rate of interest per annum equal to
the prime rate as  announced  by JP Morgan  Chase  Bank,  N.A.  on the date
payment is to be made, calculated from the Closing Date through the date on
which payment is made.

     2.5 Assumed Liabilities.  On the Closing Date, Buyer shall execute and
deliver  to  Seller  or  the  applicable  Seller  Subsidiary  one  or  more
Assumption  Agreements and one or more Lease Assignments pursuant to which,
notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  in  this  Purchase
Agreement (including Section 2.6), Buyer shall accept,  assume and agree to
pay,  perform or otherwise  discharge,  in accordance  with the  respective
terms and subject to the respective  conditions thereof, the Liabilities of
Seller  and the  Seller  Subsidiaries  pursuant  to and under  the  Assumed

employment is explicitly set forth in Section 2.5 or 5.4;

          (c) the Liabilities under the (i) Assumed Leases, (ii) Contracts,

          ------------------------------------------------------------------

          (a)  From  time  to  time  following  the  Closing,   subject  to
applicable  data  protection  Laws,  Seller  shall,  and  shall  cause  its
Affiliates  to, make  available to Buyer such data in personnel  records of
Transferred Employees (other than confidential medical information relating
to the  Transferred  Employees  for which Buyer has no ongoing  need) as is
reasonably  necessary for Buyer to transition  such  employees into Buyer's
records and otherwise comply with its obligations under Section 5.4 of this
Purchase Agreement.

          (b) From time to time  following  the  Closing,  Seller and Buyer
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge
and deliver all such further conveyances,  notices,  assumptions,  releases
and  acquittances and such other  instruments,  and shall take such further
actions,  as may be necessary or  appropriate  to assure fully to Buyer and
its  respective  successors  or  assigns,  all of the  properties,  rights,
titles, interests,  estates, remedies, powers and privileges intended to be
conveyed  to  Buyer  under  this  Purchase  Agreement  and  the  Collateral
Agreements  and to assure  fully to  Seller  and its  Affiliates  and their
successors and assigns,  the assumption of the  Liabilities  intended to be
assumed  by  Buyer  under  this  Purchase   Agreement  and  the  Collateral
Agreements,  and to otherwise make effective the transactions  contemplated
hereby  and  thereby,  including  (i)  transferring  back to  Seller or the
applicable  Seller  Subsidiary any asset or Liability not  contemplated  by
this Purchase  Agreement to be a Purchased



                                     21
<PAGE>

Asset or an Assumed Liability,  respectively,  which asset or Liability was
transferred to Buyer at the Closing,  (ii)  transferring to Buyer any asset
or  Liability  contemplated  by this  Purchase  Agreement to be a Purchased
Asset or an Assumed Liability,  respectively,  which was not transferred to
Buyer at the  Closing  and (iii) to the  extent  that  Seller or any of its
Affiliates have provided the landlord under any Lease with a bank guarantee
or letter of  credit,  Buyer  shall,  upon the  assignment  of such  Lease,
provide such landlord with a substitute  letter of credit or bank guarantee
so that Seller's or its Affiliate's bank guarantee or letter of credit will
be released.

          (c) Nothing in this Purchase  Agreement nor the  consummation  of
the  transactions  contemplated  hereby shall be construed as an attempt or
agreement to assign any Purchased  Asset,  including  any Contract,  Lease,
License, Governmental Permit, certificate, approval, authorization or other
right, which by its terms or by Law is nonassignable without the consent of
a Third Party or a  Governmental  Body or is cancelable by a Third Party or
Governmental  Body in the event of an assignment  ("Nonassignable  Assets")
unless and until such consent shall have been obtained.  Seller shall,  and
shall cause its Affiliates to, use its or their, as applicable,  reasonable
best  efforts,  if requested by Buyer,  to obtain such  consents  promptly;
provided, however, that such cooperation shall not require Seller or any of
its  Affiliates to make any payment to obtain any such consent with respect
to any Nonassignable  Asset,  except to the extent that Buyer has agreed in
writing  to  reimburse  Seller  for such  expenses,  or remain  secondarily
liable.  Except as  provided  in Section  8.2(c),  the  failure of any such
consent or approval to be obtained or the failure of any such Nonassignable
Asset  to  constitute  a  Purchased  Asset or any  circumstances  resulting
therefrom shall not, individually or in the aggregate,  constitute a Seller
Material  Adverse  Effect  or a breach  by  Seller  of any  representation,
warranty,  covenant or agreement  contained in this Purchase Agreement or a
failure  of any  condition  precedent  to  Buyer's  obligations  under this
Purchase Agreement.

          (d) (i) Buyer and Seller  shall use their  respective  reasonable
best  efforts  to  obtain,  or  to  cause  to  be  obtained,  any  consent,
substitution,  approval or  amendment  required  to novate all  obligations
under any and all Contracts or other  Liabilities  that constitute  Assumed
Liabilities or to obtain in writing the unconditional release of Seller and
its Affiliates so that, in any such case, Buyer shall be solely responsible
for such  Liabilities.  To the extent  permitted by applicable  Law, in the
event  consents  to  the  assignment  thereof  cannot  be  obtained,   such
Nonassignable  Assets shall be held,  as of and from the Closing  Date,  by
Seller  or the  applicable  Affiliate  of Seller in trust for Buyer (or any
successor to or assignee of Buyer,  by operation of Law or  otherwise)  and
the covenants  and  obligations  thereunder  shall be performed by Buyer in
Seller's or such Affiliate's name and all benefits and obligations existing
thereunder shall be for Buyer's  account.  Seller shall take or cause to be
taken at Seller's  reasonable expense such actions in its name or otherwise
as Buyer may reasonably request so as to provide Buyer with the benefits of
the  Nonassignable  Assets  and to  effect  collection  of  money  or other
consideration that becomes due and payable under the Nonassignable  Assets,
and Seller or the applicable Affiliate of Seller shall promptly pay over to
Buyer all money or other  consideration  received by it with respect to all
Nonassignable Assets.

               (ii)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in
Sections  2.7(d)(i)  and (e) hereof,  with respect to the Leased  Premises,
Buyer and Seller shall use commercially  reasonable  efforts (not including
payment  of moneys to  Third-Parties  above and beyond  any  customary  and
reasonable  ministerial or  administrative  fee) to obtain,  or cause to be
obtained,  any consent,  substitution,  assignment,  assumption,  approval,
amendment,  lease  termination or new lease on substantially the same terms
(collectively,  the  "Leased  Premises  Consents")  required  to assign any
Lease,  to novate all  obligations  under any Lease or to obtain in writing
the unconditional release of Seller and its Affiliates so that, in any such
case,  Buyer shall be solely  responsible  only for those  liabilities  and
obligations that arise from and after Closing.



                                     22
<PAGE>

          (e) As of and from the Closing  Date,  Seller on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates  authorizes Buyer, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law and the terms of the  Nonassignable  Assets,  at  Buyer's  expense,  to
perform all the  obligations  and receive all the benefits of Seller or its
Affiliates   under  the   Nonassignable   Assets  and  appoints  Buyer  its
attorney-in-fact to act in its name and on its behalf or in the name of the
applicable  Affiliate of Seller and on such Affiliate's behalf with respect
thereto.

          (f)  Notwithstanding  anything in this Purchase  Agreement to the
contrary,  unless and until any  consent or  approval  with  respect to any
Nonassignable  Asset  is  obtained,  such  Nonassignable  Asset  shall  not
constitute  a  Purchased  Asset  and any  associated  Liability  shall  not
constitute  an  Assumed  Liability  for any  purpose  under  this  Purchase
Agreement,  except to the extent  that Buyer  receives  the benefit of such
Nonassignable Asset.

     2.8 No  Licenses.  Except  as set forth in the  Intellectual  Property
Agreements or in Section 5.7 hereof, no title, right or license of any kind
is granted to Parent or Buyer  pursuant  to this  Purchase  Agreement  with
respect to any  Proprietary  Subject  Matter or  Intellectual  Property  of
Seller or any  Affiliate  of Seller,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  by
implication, by estoppel or otherwise.

     2.9 Bulk Sales Law. Buyer hereby waives  compliance by Seller and each
of the Seller  Subsidiaries  with the  requirements  and  provisions of any
"bulk-transfer"  Laws of any jurisdiction  that may otherwise be applicable
with respect to the sale of any or all of the Purchased Assets to Buyer.

     2.10  Taxes.  Buyer and  Seller  shall  share  equally  all  transfer,
documentary,  sales, use, stamp, registration, and other similar Taxes that
may be  imposed,  assessed  or  payable by reason of the  execution  of, or
consummation of the transactions  contemplated by, this Purchase  Agreement
and all reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses  relating to such Taxes
("Transfer Taxes");  provided,  however, that (a) Buyer shall have the sole
responsibility for (i) Transfer Taxes imposed as a result of Buyer's or its
assignee's  present or former connection with a jurisdiction  (other than a
present or former connection with the jurisdiction of the United States (or
any  jurisdiction  thereof or therein) or the  jurisdiction of the relevant
selling  entity)  imposing  such Transfer Tax and (ii) value added Taxes to
the extent they are fully recoverable by Buyer or its Affiliate via refund,
credit, input credit, deduction and/or offset and (b) Seller shall have the
sole  responsibility  for Seller's or any Seller  Subsidiary's  net income,
franchise or other Taxes based on Seller's or any Seller  Subsidiary's  net
income  or  gains  from  the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Purchase
Agreement. Any refunds of Transfer Taxes split by Buyer and Seller pursuant
to this Section 2.10 shall be divided equally between Buyer and Seller.  To
the extent a party pays Transfer Taxes which are levied on the other party,
to the  extent  permitted  by Law,  such  payment  shall be deemed to be an
adjustment  to the  Purchase  Price and any refund  shall also be deemed an
adjustment  to  the  Purchase  Price.  Buyer  and  Seller  agree  that  the
allocation  of  the  fees  and  expenses   relating  to  the  transfer  and
recordation of registered Business  Intellectual Property is covered in the
Intellectual  Property  Agreements  and is not  intended to be allocated by
this Section 2.10.

     2.11 Parent Guaranty. Parent unconditionally  guarantees, as a primary
obligor,  the  fulfillment  of the  covenants,  agreements  and payment and
performance  obligations of Buyer under this Purchase Agreement and each of
the  Collateral  Agreements  to which it is a party and shall be  primarily
responsible for all such covenants,  agreements and payment and performance
obligations to the extent Buyer fails to perform the same.

Intellectual  Property  that it is  licensing  to Buyer  pursuant to and in
accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  Intellectual   Property   Agreements

arising under the Nonassignable Licenses,  rights to use the Licensed Avaya
Trademarks other than as provided in Section 5.7 and as otherwise described
on Schedule 3.12(a), the Business Intellectual  Property  constitutes,  and
upon  the  Closing,  Buyer  will  have,  all  of  the  rights  in  Business

of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, and to make, have made, use,
lease, import, offer to sell and sell the products of the Business, as such
products  existed as of the date  hereof and as of the  Closing.  Except as
otherwise  disclosed  on Schedule  3.12(a),  neither  Seller nor any of the

expected to have a Seller Material  Adverse Effect.  Except as set forth on

knowledge,  are pending which  challenge the rights of Seller or any Seller
Subsidiary with respect to the Business



                                     34
<PAGE>

Intellectual Property, other than any such proceedings that individually or

Seller Material Adverse Effect.

          (c) Each License  that is included in the  Business  Intellectual

received any written  notice that it is in default under or in breach of or
is  otherwise  delinquent  in  performance  under any such  License and, to
Seller's  knowledge,  each of the other  parties  thereto has performed all
obligations  required to be  performed  by it under,  and is not in default
under,  any such  License and no event has  occurred  that,  with notice or
lapse of  time,  or both,  would  constitute  such a  default,  except  for

Material Adverse Effect.

          (d) At the Closing, Seller or one of the Seller Subsidiaries will
provide,  either  by  assignment  or  royalty-free  license  to  Buyer,  in
accordance with and subject to the limitations of the Intellectual Property
Agreements,  all of the Business  Intellectual  Property. In the event that
Seller  breaches  the warranty  set forth in Section  3.12(a),  Buyer shall
provide  Seller with a  reasonable  opportunity  to cure that breach by the
assignment  or  licensing  by Seller or one of the Seller  Subsidiaries  to

Property  Agreements,  of those  components  of such  technology  which are
required  by Buyer to conduct the  Business  after the Closing and to make,
have made,  use, lease,  import,  offer to sell or sell any products of the
Business, as such products existed as of the Closing Date.  Notwithstanding

pending,  or to  Seller's  knowledge,  threatened  claim that any  products
manufactured, assembled or distributed by the Business are defective.

     3.20  Accounts  Receivable.  All Accounts  Receivable of the Business,
including  without  limitation  all  Accounts  Receivable  as  shown on the
Financial  Statements,  are bona fide  receivables and were incurred in the
ordinary course of business for products delivered or services rendered. As
of the date of this  Purchase  Agreement,  no notice has been received from
any account  debtor that any amount of such Accounts  Receivable is subject
to any pending or threatened set-off, discount or counterclaim of any kind,
other  than  set-offs,  discounts  or  counterclaims  consistent  with past
practices and the applicable  reserves for doubtful  accounts  reflected in
the Financial Statements.

     3.21  Distributor  Incentive  and  Marketing  Programs.  Schedule 3.21
includes  copies of or  accurate  descriptions  of the  standard  terms and
conditions of distributor incentive and marketing programs for the products
of  Business  sold in the United  States.  Except as set forth in  Schedule
3.21, the products manufactured by the Business which have been sold by the
Business in the United States,  have been sold in all material  respects in
accordance with the standard distributor incentive and marketing programs.

     3.22  Inventory.  All  Inventory  whether  reflected on the  Financial
Statements  or  subsequently  created  or  acquired,  has been  created  or
acquired in the ordinary  course of business and is  suitable,  usable,  or
saleable for the  purposes for which it is intended,  subject to normal and
customary allowances for spoilage, damage and outdated items. All Inventory
has been valued on the  Financial  Statements  based on the lower of market
value or Seller's cost of the  Inventory.  The markdowns and provisions for
obsolescence and shrinkage reflected on the Financial  Statements have been
fairly  determined  consistent with past practices in accordance with GAAP.
The reserve for  obsolescence  and  shrinkage  reflected  on the  Financial
Statements  has been fairly  determined  consistent  with past practices in
accordance  with GAAP and is adequate to provide for excess,  slow  moving,
obsolete, defective, damaged or missing Inventory. Schedule 3.22 sets forth
all Inventory consigned to or from Third Parties.

     3.23  Securities  Act. (i) The Parent Shares issued to Seller pursuant
to this Purchase Agreement will not be transferred or otherwise disposed of
by Seller except in a transaction registered,  or exempt from registration,
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities  Act"),  (ii)
Seller



                                     37
<PAGE>

is acquiring the Parent Shares for its own account,  for investment and not
with  a  view  to  the  distribution  thereof  within  the  meaning  of the
Securities  Act; (iii) Seller  understands  that the Parent Shares have not
been,  and will not be,  registered  under the  Securities Act or any state
securities laws, by reason of their  acquisition by Parent in a transaction
exempt  from the  registration  requirement  thereof,  and that the  Parent
Shares may not be sold unless such sale is registered  under the Securities
Act and applicable  state  securities  laws or is exempt from  registration
thereunder;  (iv)  Seller  further  understands  that  the  exemption  from
registration  afforded by Rule 144 under the Securities Act (the provisions
of which  are known by  Seller)  depends  on the  satisfaction  of  various
conditions and that, if applicable, Rule 144 may afford the basis for sales
of Parent  Shares  only in limited  amounts;  (v) Seller is an  "accredited
investor" (as defined in Rule 501(a) under the  Securities  Act);  and (vi)
Seller has such knowledge and experience in financial and business  matters
as to be capable of  evaluating  the merits and risks of the  investment in
the Parent  Shares  hereunder and is able to bear the economic risk of loss
of such investment.

                                ARTICLE IV

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

     Parent  and  Buyer  represent  and  warrant  to  Seller,  jointly  and
severally, that:

     4.1  Organization  and  Qualification.  Parent is a  corporation  duly
organized,  validly  existing  and in good  standing  under the Laws of the
State of Delaware,  and has all requisite  corporate power and authority to
carry on its  business  as  currently  conducted  and to own or  lease  and
operate  its  properties.   Buyer  is  a  limited  liability  company  duly
organized,  validly  existing  and in good  standing  under the Laws of the
State of Delaware,  and has all requisite  limited  liability company power
and authority to carry on its business as currently conducted and to own or
lease  and  operate  its  properties.  Each of  Parent  and  Buyer  is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing (in any jurisdiction  that
recognizes  such  concept) as a foreign  corporation  or limited  liability
company,  as  applicable,  in each  jurisdiction  where  the  ownership  or
operation  of its  assets or the  conduct  of its  business  requires  such
qualification,  except  where the  failure  to be so  qualified  or in good
standing  individually  or in the  aggregate  does not have and  would  not
reasonably be expected to have a material  adverse effect on the ability of
Parent or Buyer to perform its respective  obligations  under this Purchase
Agreement  and  the  Collateral   Agreements  (a  "Buyer  Material  Adverse
Effect").  Buyer was  organized  for the sole purpose of  consummating  the
transactions contemplated by this Purchase Agreement, the Commitment Letter
(as  hereinafter  defined)  and  the  Collateral  Agreements.   Except  for
Liabilities incurred in connection with its organization or the negotiation
and  consummation  of  the  transactions   contemplated  by  this  Purchase
Agreement,  the Commitment Letter and the Collateral Agreements,  Buyer has
neither incurred any Liabilities nor engaged in any business.

     4.2  Authorization; Binding Effect.
          -----------------------------

          (a)  Each of  Parent  and  Buyer  has  all  requisite  power  and
authority to execute and deliver this Purchase Agreement and the Collateral
Agreements and to effect the transactions  contemplated hereby and thereby,
and the execution,  delivery and performance of this Purchase Agreement and
the  Collateral  Agreements  have been  duly  authorized  by all  requisite
action.

          (b) This Purchase  Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by each of  Parent  and  Buyer  and this  Purchase  Agreement  is,  and the
Collateral  Agreements,  when duly  executed  and  delivered  by Parent and
Buyer, as the case may be, will be valid and legally binding obligations of
Parent and Buyer,  enforceable  against Parent and Buyer in accordance with
their respective terms.



                                     38
<PAGE>

     4.3  Non-Contravention; Consents.
          ---------------------------

          (a) The  execution,  delivery and  performance  of this  Purchase
Agreement and the Collateral Agreements by each of Parent and Buyer and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and
will not (i) result in a breach or violation  of any  provision of Parent's
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Buyer's  certificate of formation
or limited liability company agreement,  (ii) violate or result in a breach
of or constitute an occurrence of default under any provision of, result in
the acceleration or cancellation of any obligation under, or give rise to a
right by any  party  to  terminate  or amend  its  obligations  under,  any
mortgage,  deed of trust, conveyance to secure debt, note, loan, indenture,
lien,  lease,  Agreement,  instrument or other arrangement or commitment to
which  Parent  or Buyer is a party  or by  which  they or their  respective
assets  or  properties  are bound or (iii)  violate  any  order,  judgment,
decree,  rule or regulation of any  Governmental  Body having  jurisdiction
over Parent or Buyer or any of their respective properties,  other than, in
the  case of  clauses  (ii)  and  (iii),  any  such  violations,  breaches,
defaults,  accelerations  or  cancellations  of  obligations or rights that
individually  or in the  aggregate do not have and would not  reasonably be
expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

          (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.3(b), no consent, approval,
order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Person is required to be obtained by Buyer in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Purchase  Agreement and the  Collateral  Agreements or
the  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby or thereby by
Parent or Buyer,  except for (i) any filings  required to be made under the
HSR Act and any applicable filings required under foreign  Competition Laws
and (ii) such consents, approvals, orders,  authorizations,  registrations,
declarations  or  filings  the  failure  of which to be  obtained  or made,
individually  or in the aggregate,  do not have and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

     4.4 SEC  Reports;  Financial  Statements.  Parent has filed all forms,
reports and documents required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission  ("SEC")  since  December 31, 2002 (any of the  foregoing  filed
prior  to the date  hereof  are  referred  to  herein  as the  "Parent  SEC
Reports").  Each  Parent SEC Report  complied  at the time of filing in all
material  respects with all applicable  requirements  of the Securities Act
and the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange  Act"),
as in effect as of the filing date of such Parent SEC Report.  None of such
Parent  SEC  Reports,  including  any  financial  statements  or  schedules
included or  incorporated  by reference  therein,  contained when filed any
untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omitted to state a material  fact
required to be stated or incorporated by reference  therein or necessary in
order to make the statements  therein in light of the  circumstances  under
which they were made not misleading,  except to the extent  superseded by a
Parent SEC Report  filed  subsequently  and prior to the date  hereof.  The
audited consolidated  financial statements of Parent included in the Parent
SEC Reports fairly present in all material respects, the financial position
of Parent as of the dates  thereof  and the results of its  operations  and
cash flows for each for the periods then ended,  in each case in conformity
with GAAP  applied on a consistent  basis  throughout  the periods  covered
thereby (subject in the case of unaudited financial  statements,  to normal
and recurring  year-end audit  adjustments  which,  individually  or in the
aggregate, would not be material).

     4.5 Parent Common Stock. The Parent Shares to be issued to Seller as a
portion of the Purchase Price have been duly authorized and, when issued at
Closing, shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.  The shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of the Convertible Note
have been duly authorized and reserved,  and when issued upon conversion of
the Convertible Note in accordance with the terms of the Convertible  Note,
shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.



                                     39
<PAGE>

     4.6 Brokers.  Other than Wachovia Capital  Markets,  LLC, the fees and
expenses of which will be paid by Parent and Buyer,  no broker,  investment
banker,  financial  advisor or other  Person is entitled  to any  broker's,
finder's,  financial  advisor's  or  other  similar  fee or  commission  in
connection with the  transactions  contemplated by this Purchase  Agreement
based on  arrangements  made by or on  behalf  of Parent or Buyer or any of
their Affiliates.

     4.7  Sufficiency  of Funds.  Parent has delivered to Seller a true and
complete  copy of a letter of  commitment  obtained by Parent from Wachovia
Bank,  National  Association to provide debt financing for the transactions
contemplated  hereby  pursuant to a senior  secured  credit  facility  (the
"Commitment Letter"). An executed copy of the Commitment Letter is attached
hereto as  Exhibit  H.  Assuming  that the  financing  contemplated  by the
Commitment Letter is consummated in accordance with the terms thereof,  the
funds to be borrowed thereunder by Parent (including,  if applicable,  with
respect  to  the  special  closing  commitment),   together  with  Parent's
available cash, will provide  sufficient  funds to Parent and Buyer to make
the Cash Payment and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As
of the date of this Purchase  Agreement,  to the actual knowledge of senior
management of Parent,  there are no facts or  circumstances  related to the
business,  assets, condition or operation of Parent and its subsidiaries or
the  Business  that create a  reasonable  basis for Parent to believe  that
Parent  will  not be able  to  obtain  the  financing  contemplated  by the
Commitment Letter.

     4.8  No Inducement or Reliance; Independent Assessment.
          -------------------------------------------------

          (a) With respect to the  Purchased  Assets,  the Business and any
other  rights  or  obligations  to be  transferred  hereunder  or under the
Collateral  Agreements or pursuant  hereto or thereto,  neither  Parent nor
Buyer has been  induced  by and has not  relied  upon any  representations,
warranties or statements,  whether express or implied,  made by Seller, any
Affiliate  or any agent,  employee,  attorney  or other  representative  of
Seller or by any other  Person  representing  or  purporting  to  represent
Seller,  that are not expressly set forth in this Purchase  Agreement or in
the Collateral  Agreements (including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and
thereto), whether or not any such representations, warranties or statements
were made in writing or orally.

          (b) Each of Parent  and Buyer  acknowledges  that it has made its
own  assessment of the present  condition  and the future  prospects of the
Business and is sufficiently  experienced to make an informed judgment with
respect thereto. Each of Parent and Buyer further acknowledges that neither
Seller  nor any  Affiliate  of Seller  has made any  warranty,  express  or
implied,  as to the future  prospects of the Business or its  profitability
for  Parent  or Buyer or with  respect  to any  forecasts,  projections  or
business plans prepared by or on behalf of Seller and delivered to Buyer in
connection  with the Business and the negotiation and the execution of this
Purchase Agreement.

non-employee representatives to be reasonably available to Parent and Buyer
for such purposes. In conducting any inspections,  sampling, investigations
or tests of the  Transferred  Premises or Leased  Premises or in installing

not extend to  protect  Seller  from any  Encumbrances,  claims,  causes of
action, damages,  Liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees)  arising  out of  discovery  by  Parent  or  Buyer  of any  Hazardous
Substance or  contamination.  Parent's and Buyer's  obligations  under this

confidentiality  obligation),  reasonable access for inspection and copying

faith  to  resolve  such  objections.  Any  issues  not  resolved  by  such
negotiations  shall  be  submitted  to an  independent  accounting  firm of
national  standing  satisfactory  to the parties  which  shall  resolve the
issues  within 30 days after  submission  of the issues to such  accounting
firm.  The costs of the  accounting  firm shall be shared equally by Seller
and Buyer. The parties agree to prepare the Asset Acquisition  Statement in
accordance with the allocations proposed by Buyer as amended by the results
of the  negotiations and resolutions of the accounting firm described above
and to timely file such Asset  Acquisition  Statement with their respective
United States federal income tax returns and neither Seller nor Buyer shall
take  a Tax  position  which  is  inconsistent  with  such  Purchase  Price
allocation;  provided, however, that the parties agree that, in all events,
the Asset  Acquisition  Statement  will  provide  that the  portion  of the
Purchase  Price  and  the  Assumed  Liabilities  allocated  to  any  of the
Purchased  Assets  which  are  held by a  Seller  Subsidiary  that is not a
Domestic  Subsidiary shall be equal to the net book value of such Purchased
Assets as of the Closing Date, or the Subsequent Closing, as applicable.

          (c)  Buyer  and  Seller  hereby  agree  that the  portion  of the
Purchase Price properly  attributable  to the Purchased  Assets situated in
Ireland or otherwise  related to Ireland  consists  entirely of cash, being
part of the Cash Payment. The applicable Seller Subsidiary shall produce to
Buyer (or Buyer's assignee or assignees under Section 10.4, if appropriate)
prior to Closing a tax  certificate  under  Section  980 of the Irish Taxes
Consolidation  Act, 1997 (as amended) in relation to the land and buildings
situated in Ireland that are part of the Purchased Assets.

     5.4  Transferred Employees.
          ---------------------

          (a) As of the Closing Date (for purposes of this Section 5.4, the
Closing Date shall also refer to the date of each  Subsequent  Closing,  as
applicable),  Buyer  shall  make  offers  of  employment  to  all  Business
Employees listed on Schedule 3.8(a)(i) as amended and presented to Buyer at
Closing  and  anytime  prior to Closing if  reasonably  requested  by Buyer
(including those absent due to vacation, holiday, illness, leave of absence
or short-term disability, but excluding any Business Employees on long-term
disability,   any  Business  Employee  whose  employment  is  automatically
transferred  to  Buyer  pursuant  to any  applicable  Law  of any  non-U.S.
jurisdiction  (a  "non-U.S.  Law")  regardless  of  whether  such  Business
Employee  accepts  Buyer's  offer of employment  ("Mandatorily  Transferred
Employees")  with respect to which the terms of Section 5.4(p) shall apply,
or any Business  Employee  employed by Avaya  Tianjin);  provided that: (i)
unless otherwise  required under applicable  non-U.S.  Law, with respect to
any Business  Employee who is on leave or  short-term  disability as of the
Closing Date,  Buyer shall only be required to make offers of employment to
such  Business  Employees who are able and willing to return to work within
180 days  after  the  Closing  Date,  and (ii)  with  respect  to  Business
Employees  covered  by a  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  or a  Non-U.S.
Collective  Bargaining Agreement,  Business Employees on leave,  short-term
disability or long-term disability on the Closing Date who subsequently are
able and



                                     44
<PAGE>

willing  to  return to work  shall be  offered  employment  if, as and when
required  by the  applicable  Agreement.  A Business  Employee  who accepts
Buyer's offer of employment and commences employment with Buyer or who is a
Mandatorily  Transferred Employee, in either case, as of the effective date
of  their  employment  with  Buyer,   are   collectively   referred  to  as
"Transferred Employees";  provided, however, that no Early Retiree shall be
a Transferred  Employee.  Transferred  Employees who are  represented  by a
union on the  Closing  Date are  referred  to as  "Represented  Transferred
Employees"; and Transferred Employees who are not represented by a union on
the Closing  Date are  referred  to as  "Salaried  Transferred  Employees."
Employment with Buyer of Transferred Employees shall be effective as of the
day following the Closing Date,  except that (x) the employment of Salaried
Transferred  Employees  receiving  short-term  disability  benefits  or  on
approved  leave  of  absence  (excluding   vacation,   holiday,   scheduled
non-working day or illness other than short-term disability) on the Closing
Date will become effective as of the date they present  themselves for work
with Buyer;  provided,  however, that Buyer shall not be required to employ
any Salaried  Business Employee who is able to return to active service and
does not  present  himself  or  herself  for work  with  Buyer on the first
Business Day following the last day of his or her approved absence,  and no
such  Business  Employee  shall  be a  Transferred  Employee,  and  (y) the
employment of the Represented Transferred Employees receiving short-term or
long-term  disability  benefits or on an  approved  leave of absence on the
Closing  Date  will  become  effective  if,  as and  when  required  by the
applicable  Agreement.  Buyer  agrees  to  assume  all  immigration-related
rights,  duties and obligations of Seller with regard to both  nonimmigrant
and immigrant  processes,  including the obligations of all certified labor
condition  applications,  labor certification  applications,  and immigrant
visa  petitions,  and act as  successor  in  interest  with  regard to such
applications and petitions.

          (b) As of the Closing Date,  Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall
adopt, or cause to be adopted for the benefit of U.S. Salaried  Transferred
Employees a total  compensation  package of salary,  bonus  opportunity and
benefits (other than retiree  welfare  benefits and defined benefit pension
plans)  that  is in the  aggregate  comparable  to  that  provided  to U.S.
Salaried  Transferred  Employees  by Seller on the Closing Date (other than
retiree welfare benefits and defined benefit pension plans);  provided that
nothing herein shall prohibit Buyer or any of its Affiliates  from amending
or  terminating  any plan at any time  following  the  Closing  Date.  Each
employee  benefit plan (as described in Section 3(3) of ERISA) of Buyer and
its subsidiaries,  including pension plans,  welfare plans,  vacation plans
and severance  plans,  shall  recognize (i) for purposes of satisfying  any
deductibles,  co-pays and out-of-pocket maximums during the coverage period
that  includes  the  Closing  Date,  any  payment  made by any  Transferred
Employee towards  deductibles,  co-pays and  out-of-pocket  maximums in any
comparable   Company  Plan  and  (ii)  for  purposes  of   eligibility   to
participate,  early  retirement  eligibility  (if  any),  early  retirement
subsidies  (if any),  vesting and  schedule of  benefits,  all service with
Seller or a Seller Subsidiary, including service with predecessor employers
that was recognized by any comparable  Company Plan and any prior unbridged
service  with Seller or a Seller  Subsidiary;  provided  that such  service
shall not be  recognized to the extent such  recognition  would result in a
duplication  of benefits or if such service would not have been  recognized
under Buyer's plan in respect of its employees.

          (c)  Subject  to any  agreements  set  forth  in  the  Transition
Services Agreement,  Seller agrees to maintain the Avaya Inc. Reimbursement
Account Plan  ("Seller's  Cafeteria  Plan") until the later of (i) December
31,  2003,  and  (ii) the last day on  which  claims  may be  submitted  to
Seller's Cafeteria Plan pursuant to the terms thereof for the period ending
December  31,  2003  ("Last  Day"),  for the  benefit  of each  Transferred
Employee  who has such an  account  under  Seller's  Cafeteria  Plan on the
Closing Date, and shall permit any and all of such Transferred Employees to
continue their  participation  in Seller's  Cafeteria Plan through December
31, 2003. Through and including December 31, 2003, Seller shall continue to
accept  contributions  made  pursuant  to  any  existing  salary  reduction
elections made by Transferred  Employees under Seller's  Cafeteria Plan for
the 2003 plan  year.  Such  elections  shall be honored by Buyer as if such
elections were made under a cafeteria  plan qualified  under Section 125 of
the Code  maintained by Buyer,  and Buyer shall transfer to Seller any such
contributions  made by a



                                     45
<PAGE>

Transferred  Employee  pursuant such an election  promptly after receipt of
such contributions.  Seller shall accept and process any claims incurred on
or prior to December 31, 2003 under  Seller's  Cafeteria Plan in accordance
with the terms thereof. Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for any reasonable
costs incurred as a result of Seller's administration of Seller's Cafeteria
Plan for the period  commencing  after the  Closing  Date and ending on the
Last Day,  provided that such costs shall be limited to those  attributable
to Transferred Employees who are actually employed by Buyer.

          (d) Seller shall cause all Transferred  Employees to become fully
vested in the Avaya Inc.  Savings  Plan,  the Avaya Inc.  Savings  Plan for
Salaried  Employees,  the Avaya Inc.  Pension Plan, the Avaya Inc.  Pension
Plan for Salaried  Employees  (Services  Based Program and Account  Balance
Program),  the Avaya  Inc.  Deferred  Compensation  Plan,  the  Avaya  Inc.
Supplemental  Pension Plan and to the extent  required by applicable Law or
the terms of the applicable plan  documents,  the Avaya equity programs (as
applicable)  on the  Closing  Date and agrees to  contribute  any  matching
contributions  to the Avaya Inc.  Savings  Plan and the Avaya Inc.  Savings
Plan for  Salaried  Employees  on such  date that  such  contributions  are
normally made under such plans,  without regard to whether the  Transferred
Employee is employed by Seller on such contribution date, and to amend such
plans, if necessary, to permit such contributions.

          (e)  Buyer  shall,  on or prior to a date  (the  "First  Transfer
Date")  to be  mutually  agreed by Buyer and  Seller,  establish  a defined
benefit pension plan (the "Buyer  Represented  Pension Plan"),  with trusts
thereunder (the "Represented  Pension Trust"), for the purpose of accepting
a transfer of the  pension  plan  liabilities  and assets  attributable  to
Represented  Transferred Employees,  as described herein. Buyer shall prior
to the First Transfer Date provide Seller with written  evidence of (i) the
adoption  of the  new  plan  by  Buyer,  (ii)  the  creation  of the  trust
thereunder, and (iii) the submission by Buyer of such plan to the IRS for a
favorable  determination  letter.  On the First Transfer Date,  Seller will
transfer or cause to be transferred  from the trust under the Avaya Pension
Plan to the Represented Pension Trust, cash or, to the extent agreed by the
parties,  marketable  securities/units  in commingled  funds,  in an amount
equal to 90% of the estimated  Pension  Transfer Amount for the Represented
Transferred Employees (the "First Pension Transfer Amount"),  plus earnings
on the amounts transferred from the Closing Date through the First Transfer
Date at a rate equal to the actual  investment  gain or loss  (realized and
unrealized) on the assets of the Avaya Inc.  Pension Plan for which a daily
valuation is made (assuming no change in the allocation of assets among the
different  investment  accounts  after  the  Closing  Date and all  benefit
payments  are made from a fixed income  investment  account  designated  by
Seller and reasonably  acceptable to Buyer) (the "Actual Return").  As of a
date not more  than 60 days  after  the First  Transfer  Date (the  "Second
Transfer Date"),  Seller shall transfer or cause to be transferred from the
trust under the Avaya  Pension Plan to the  Represented  Pension Trust cash
or, to the extent agreed by the parties hereto, marketable securities/units
in commingled  funds, in an amount (the "Second Pension  Transfer  Amount")
equal to the sum of (i) the Pension Transfer Amount minus the First Pension
Transfer  Amount,  plus (ii) earnings on the amount described in clause (i)
from the Closing Date through the Second  Transfer Date equal to the Actual
Return.  In the event the Second Pension Transfer Amount is less than zero,
then Buyer shall  transfer or cause to be  transferred  such amount in cash
from the  Represented  Pension Trust back to the trust under the Avaya Inc.
Pension  Plan,  plus  investment  gain or loss  thereon  based on the fixed
income  portfolio under Buyer's  Represented  Pension Plan.  Subject to the
completion of the foregoing asset transfers, as of the Closing Date, all of
the obligations and associated  Liabilities of the Avaya Inc.  Pension Plan
relating to the Represented  Transferred Employees shall be assumed in full
by the Buyer  Represented  Pension  Plan,  except  that  prior to the First
Transfer Date all payments required under the Avaya Inc. Pension Plan shall
be made by the Avaya Inc. Pension Plan.

          (f) For  purposes of this  Section  5.4,  the  "Pension  Transfer
Amount"  shall mean the minimum  required  transfer  amount  determined  in
accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  Avaya  Inc.  Pension  Plan  and  the
requirements  of Section  414(1) of the Code based on the  accrued  benefit
obligation, as of the



                                     46
<PAGE>

Closing Date, of Represented Transferred Employees as if they were employed
as  of  such  date  by  Seller,  utilizing  the  "safe  harbor"  rates  and
assumptions set forth in the regulations  promulgated under Section 4044 of
ERISA as of the Closing Date,  except that the  termination  and retirement
rate assumptions  utilized for purposes of this Section 5.4(f) shall be the
assumptions set forth on Schedule 5.4(f) and no expense load, including any
loading  charge  determined  under  the  Loading  Assumptions  set forth in
Appendix C to Part 4044 of the PBGC  Regulations,  shall be charged and the
assets of the Avaya  Inc.  Pension  Plan  shall be  deemed to  include  all
accrued but unpaid contributions to the plan.

          (g) Assets of certain of Seller's Voluntary  Employees'  Benefits
Associations ("VEBAs") will be transferred to Buyer's VEBAs as described in
this Section 5.4(g).

               (i) This  Section  5.4(g)(i)  shall  govern the  transfer of
assets from the Avaya Post-retirement Life and Health VEBAs for Represented
Transferred Employees (also referred to herein as the "Avaya VEBAs") to one
or more  corresponding  Buyer  Post-retirement  Life and Health VEBAs (also
referred to herein as the "Buyer  VEBAs"),  which Buyer shall establish and
submit  to the IRS for a  favorable  ruling as to their  tax-exempt  status
prior to the Second  Transfer Date. If Seller is reasonably  satisfied that
the  corresponding  Buyer   Post-retirement   Life  and  Health  VEBAs  are
tax-exempt  under  Section  501(c)(9) of the Code,  then on or prior to the
Second Transfer Date,  Seller shall determine the aggregate  present value,
as  of  the  Closing  Date,  of  the  accumulated  post-retirement  benefit
obligation  of the Avaya Inc.  Retiree  Medical  Expense Plan and the Avaya
Inc. Life  Insurance  Plans  (together the "Avaya Retiree  Welfare  Plans")
funded by such Avaya Post-retirement Life and Health VEBAs, with respect to
all Represented  Transferred Employees (the "Retiree Welfare Liabilities"),
and shall transfer or cause to be  transferred  to Buyer's  Post-Retirement
Life and  Health  VEBAs  cash or,  to the  extent  agreed  by the  parties,
marketable securities/units in commingled funds, in an amount determined as
set forth below. Such amount (the "VEBA Transfer Amount") shall be equal to
the fair  market  value as of the  Closing  Date of the assets of the plans
funded by such Avaya VEBAs multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the accumulated  post-retirement benefits obligation under FAS 106
for Represented Transferred Employees whose post-retirement life and health
benefits are funded by such VEBAs,  and the  denominator  of which shall be
the accumulated  post-retirement  benefits obligation under FAS 106 for all
participants and dependents whose  post-retirement life and health benefits
are funded by such VEBAs. Buyer and Seller shall adopt, and shall use their
reasonable  best efforts to cause their  insurers to adopt,  procedures  to
implement such asset transfers in a reasonable and expeditious  manner that
is  consistent  with the  underlying  group life  insurance  contracts  and
applicable legal requirements.

               (ii) For  purposes of this  Section  5.4(g),  all  Liability
determinations  shall be made as of the Closing  Date,  based on the active
and  inactive  census  data  as  of  the  Closing  Date.  For  purposes  of
determining  the Retiree Welfare  Liabilities,  the assumptions and methods
shall be those set forth on Schedule 5.4(f).  The amounts to be transferred
as  described  above  shall be  decreased  by the  aggregate  amount of any
payments  made by an Avaya  VEBA with  respect to  Represented  Transferred
Employees prior to such transfer, and adjusted by earnings or losses on the
amounts transferred from the Closing Date through the date of such transfer
at a rate  equal  to the  actual  investment  gain  or loss  (realized  and
unrealized)  on the assets of the Avaya VEBAs.  Upon the  completion of the
foregoing transfer,  all obligations and associated  liabilities of each of
the  Avaya  Post-retirement  Life and  Health  VEBAs  with  respect  to the
Represented   Transferred  Employees  shall  be  assumed  in  full  by  the
corresponding Buyer Post Retirement Life and Health VEBAs, and prior to the
completion of the asset  transfers  described in this Section  5.4(g),  all
payments  required  under the Avaya Retiree  Welfare Plans shall be made by
Buyer's  portion of the Avaya  VEBAs.  Nothing in this  Purchase  Agreement
shall be  interpreted  to provide that any assets  transferred  pursuant to
this Section 5.4(g) have reverted to Seller or Buyer.



                                     47
<PAGE>

          (h) Seller, on or prior to the Second Transfer Date, shall notify
Buyer in  writing  of  Seller's  determination  of the  amounts  of  assets
required to be  transferred  in accordance  with the provisions of Sections
5.4(e),  (f), (g) and (s) and the defined  benefit  pension plan  projected
benefit  obligation,  as defined  in FAS 87 in  respect of the  Represented
Transferred Employees, as of the Closing based on the assumptions set forth
on Schedule 5.4(f) (the "Pension Liabilities"), the defined benefit pension
plan  projected  obligation,  as  defined  in  FAS  87 in  respect  of  the
Transferred  Employees  located in Ireland as of the  Closing  based on the
assumptions set forth on Schedule 5.4(s) (the "Irish Pension Liabilities"),
and the Retiree Welfare  Liabilities  based on the assumptions set forth on
Schedule 5.4(f), and shall provide Buyer with a copy of the census data and
actuarial   reports  (which  shall  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the
professional standards applicable thereto) relating to the determination of
such amounts,  together with such related materials as Buyer may reasonably
request,  and,  in the case of the  transfers  of  assets  contemplated  by
Sections  5.4(e),  (f),  (g) and (s),  shall  provide  Buyer with a written
determination by Seller's actuary that the amounts of assets proposed to be
transferred are not less than the required amounts determined in accordance
with this Purchase Agreement.

          (i) Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of Buyer's  disagreement
with any determination made by Seller pursuant to Section 5.4(h) as soon as
practicable  and in any event  within  180 days after the date on which the
information  specified in Section  5.4(h) is provided to Buyer.  If no such
notice is given by Buyer prior to the  expiration of the foregoing  period,
the  determinations   contained  in  Seller's  notice  to  Buyer  shall  be
conclusive  and binding  upon the parties  hereto.  If Buyer gives  written
notice to Seller prior to the  expiration of the foregoing  period  setting
forth any  objections  to the  determinations  made by Seller,  the parties
shall  attempt in good  faith to reach an  agreement  as to all  matters in
dispute.  If the parties hereto,  notwithstanding  such good-faith  effort,
fail to resolve all matters in dispute  within 30 days after Buyer  advises
Seller of its  objections,  then any  remaining  disputed  matters shall be
finally and  conclusively  determined  by a qualified  independent  actuary
selected  by Seller  and  Buyer,  which  actuary  shall not be the  regular
actuary of either party. Promptly, but in no event later than 30 days after
its acceptance of its  appointment,  the actuary shall determine only those
matters in dispute  and shall  render a written  report as to the  disputed
matters  and the  resulting  calculation  of the  pension  or other  assets
required to be transferred  by Seller in accordance  with the provisions of
Section  5.4(e),  (f), (g) and (s),  which report shall be  conclusive  and
binding upon the parties.  The parties shall share the fees and expenses of
the actuary equally.

          (j) If the sum of the Pension Liabilities and the Retiree Welfare
Liabilities  exceeds  the  sum of the  Pension  Transfer  Amount  and  VEBA
Transfer Amount (such excess herein referred to as the  "Underfunding")  by
more than  $66,700,000,  then on the Second  Transfer  Date,  the principal
amount  of the  Convertible  Note  shall  be  reduced  dollar  for  dollar,
effective  as of the  Closing  Date,  by  the  amount  of the  Underfunding
exceeding  $66,700,000;  provided,  however,  that to the  extent  that the
amount of the Underfunding  exceeding $66,700,000 reduces the amount of the
Convertible  Note to zero,  Seller  shall pay to Buyer by wire  transfer of
immediately  available  funds to such  account  or  accounts  as Buyer  may
designate to Seller in writing,  the amount of the  Underfunding  exceeding
$66,700,000  not so  applied  in  reduction  of the  Convertible  Note.  If
$66,700,000  exceeds  the  amount of the  Underfunding,  then on the Second
Transfer  Date,  the  principal  amount of the  Convertible  Note  shall be
increased  dollar for  dollar,  effective  as of the Closing  Date,  by the
amount of such excess;  provided,  however, that such increase shall not be
in excess of $10,000,000.  Any amounts paid under this Section 5.4(j) shall
be paid together  with  interest  thereon at the rate of interest per annum
equal to the prime rate as announced  by JP Morgan Chase Bank,  N.A. on the
date  payment is to be made,  calculated  from the Closing Date through the
date on which payment is made.

          (k)  Seller  hereby  acknowledges  that  for  FICA  and  FUTA Tax
purposes,  Buyer  qualifies  as a successor  employer  with  respect to the
Transferred  Employees  located in the  United  States  ("U.S.  Transferred
Employees").  In connection with the foregoing,  at Buyer's option,  Seller
agrees to follow  the



                                     48
<PAGE>

"Alternative Procedures" set forth in Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 96-60.
Buyer  shall  notify  Seller of its  intention  to follow the  "Alternative
Procedures" on or immediately  after the Closing Date. If the  "Alternative
Procedures"  are  followed,  Seller and Buyer  understand  that Buyer shall
assume  Seller's  entire  obligation  to  furnish a Form W-2,  Wage and Tax
Statement,  to the U.S. Transferred Employees. In addition to all personnel
files and records  relating to the Transferred  Employees that Seller shall
deliver to Buyer as of the Closing  Date or as  otherwise  required by this
Purchase  Agreement,  Seller  shall timely  provide  Buyer with any and all
other  information  (and in such  format and media) as it shall  reasonably
request to properly comply with the requirements in the preceding sentence,
which in no event shall be more than 10  Business  Days after the date that
Buyer  notifies   Seller  of  its  intention  to  follow  such   "Alternate
Procedures."

          (l) SS  Holdings  shall  recognize  the  Unions as the  exclusive
bargaining  representatives for the respective  collective bargaining units
of  the  Represented   Transferred  Employees  and  assume  the  Collective
Bargaining  Agreements  effective  as of the  Closing  Date.  Buyer  or its
delegate shall recognize the union or equivalent  Person under any Non-U.S.
Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  and  shall  assume  each  such  Non-U.S.
Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  effective as of the Closing Date.  Buyer
agrees that, as successor  employer under each such  collective  bargaining
agreement,  it shall comply with any equitable  relief  legally  binding on
Buyer awarded pursuant to such collective  bargaining  agreements after the
Closing Date.

          (m) Buyer shall make and be  responsible  for all accrued  bonus,
sales incentive or similar  compensation  payments,  if any, to Transferred
Employees for any period prior to the Closing Date and assumed  pursuant to
Section 2.5, and neither  Seller nor any of its  Affiliates  shall have any
Liability with respect to such obligations.

          (n) Except as explicitly set forth in Section 5.4(c) and (g), (i)
Seller shall retain all Liability for all medical,  dental,  life insurance
or other  welfare  benefit  claims  incurred  under its Company Plans on or
prior to the  Closing  Date,  and neither  Buyer nor any of its  Affiliates
shall have any Liability with respect to such  obligations,  and (ii) after
the Closing Date,  Buyer shall be responsible  for all such claims incurred
after the Closing Date with respect to each Transferred  Employee under and
in  accordance  with Buyer's  benefit  plans.  For purposes of this Section
5.4(n),  a claim will be deemed to have been  incurred on the date of death
in the case of life insurance benefits and on the date on which the medical
treatment or service was rendered or expense actually  incurred in the case
of medical, dental and other claims.

          (o) Seller shall be responsible  for and shall defend,  indemnify
and hold  harmless  Buyer for any  failure to provide  health  continuation
coverage (including any penalties,  excise taxes or interest resulting from
the failure to provide continuation  coverage) required by Section 4980B of
the Code due to  qualifying  events with respect to  Transferred  Employees
which occur on or before the Closing Date.  Buyer shall be responsible  for
and shall defend,  indemnify  and hold  harmless  Seller for any failure to
provide health continuation coverage (including any penalties, excise taxes
or interest  resulting from the failure to provide  continuation  coverage)
required by Section 4980B of the Code due to qualifying events with respect
to  Transferred  Employees  which occur  after the Closing  Date and Seller
shall be  responsible  for  providing  any  applicable  COBRA  notices with
respect to events occurring on the Closing Date.

          (p) With respect to any Mandatorily  Transferred  Employee or any
other  Transferred  Employee  employed outside the U.S. on the Closing Date
(collectively  the  "Foreign  Transferred  Employees"),  (i)  Buyer  or its
subsidiaries  shall provide terms and conditions of employment with respect
to each such Foreign  Transferred  Employee  that are the same as the terms
and  conditions  of  employment  applicable  to  such  Foreign  Transferred
Employee  immediately  prior to the  applicable  Closing Date to the extent
required  by  applicable  non-U.S.   Law  to  accomplish  the  transfer  of
employment of such employee,



                                     49
<PAGE>

the  sale  of the  Business  or  avoid  the  payment  of any  severance  or
termination  Liability to the  employee  that would  otherwise  arise under
applicable  non-U.S.  Laws in connection with the transfer of employment or
the consummation of the transaction and (ii) Buyer and Seller agree to take
such  actions  as  are  reasonably  practicable  in  connection  therewith,
including  the  assumption  by Buyer  of  Liabilities  attributable  to the
employment of any Foreign  Transferred  Employee on or prior to the Closing
Date, but only if and to the extent necessary to accomplish the transfer of
employment,  the sale of the Business or avoid the payment of any severance
or  termination  Liability to the employee  that would  otherwise  arise in
connection  with the  transfer of  employment  or the  consummation  of the
transaction  under any  applicable  non-U.S.  Law.  In the  event  Buyer is
obligated to assume any  Liability  attributable  to the  employment of any
Foreign  Transferred  Employee on or prior to the  Closing  Date that would
otherwise  be a  Liability  of Seller,  notwithstanding  clause (ii) of the
foregoing sentence, Seller shall remain responsible for such Liability.

          (q) After the Closing Date,  Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall
adopt,  or cause to be adopted  for the  benefit of  Transferred  Employees
employed  outside  of the  United  States  on the  Closing  Date,  a  total
compensation  package of salary,  bonus opportunity and benefits,  that, in
the aggregate, is comparable to that provided to such Transferred Employees
by Seller on the Closing  Date (other than  retiree  welfare  benefits  and
defined benefit pension plans). On the Closing Date, to the extent required
to transfer  the  employment  or the  Business  or to avoid  payment of any
severance,  Seller  agrees,  with  respect  to  each  Transferred  Employee
employed outside the U.S., to vest any benefits which have not vested as of
the Closing  Date or credit  service  with Buyer after the Closing Date for
vesting purposes under any of its non-U.S. Company Plans.

          (r) Under Seller's applicable Company Plan or Plans, as currently
in effect, any Salaried Transferred Employee who as of the Closing Date (a)
is at least  age 55 and has at least 15 years of  service  is  eligible  to
elect on a one-time basis to commence to receive Seller subsidized  retiree
medical  benefits  at any time  following  the  Closing  Date as a  retired
employee; or (b) is at least age 50 and has at least 15 years of service is
eligible  to elect on a  one-time  basis to  commence  to  receive  retiree
medical benefits, at the sole expense of the Salaried Transferred Employee,
at any time  following  the Closing  Date as a retired  employee;  it being
understood  that the  foregoing  does not  constitute a  representation  or
commitment  that such benefits will be provided in the future and that such
benefits  are and shall be provided in  accordance  with and subject to the
terms of the  applicable  plan  document.  Subject to the  applicable  plan
document,  as amended from time to time (but,  until the  expiration of the
current  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement with the Unions on May 31, 2006,
not in a manner that, in form, materially discriminates against Transferred
Employees as compared to similarly situated Seller employees  participating
in the  applicable  Company  Plan),  this benefit  shall be  available  for
election on a one-time  basis under the Company Plans at any time after the
Closing Date,  regardless of whether the Salaried  Transferred  Employee is
employed by Buyer at the time of the election.  All  Liabilities  under the
applicable  Company Plan with respect to the obligations  described in this
Section  5.4(r) shall be borne solely by Seller,  and neither Buyer nor any
of  its   Affiliates   shall  have  any  Liability  with  respect  to  such
obligations.

          (s) Buyer  shall  assume or  otherwise  accept a transfer  of the
assets and  liabilities  of the pension plan  maintained in the Republic of
Ireland  that is a  defined  benefit  scheme  (as  defined  under the Irish
Pensions  Act  of  1990)  (the  "Irish  Pension  Plan")   attributable   to
Transferred  Employees  located in the Republic of Ireland in a manner that
is mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller;  provided,  however, that only
the assumptions set forth in Schedule 5.4(s) shall be utilized for purposes
of the  determinations to be made under this Section 5.4(s).  The amount of
the assets to be transferred  shall be decreased by the aggregate amount of
any payments  made by the Irish  Pension  Plan with respect to  Transferred
Employees  located in the Republic of Ireland prior to such  transfer,  and
shall be adjusted by earnings or losses on the amounts transferred from the
Closing  Date  through  the date of such  transfer  at a rate  equal to the
actual  investment  gain or loss (realized and unrealized) on the assets of
the Irish Pension  Plan.  To the extent



                                     50
<PAGE>

that the  Irish  Pension  Liabilities  exceed  the  asset  transfer  amount
(determined  as of the Closing  Date prior to  adjustment  for earnings and
losses  between  the  Closing  Date  and  the  date  that  the  assets  are
transferred),  the amount of the Convertible Note shall be reduced,  dollar
for dollar, effective as of the Closing Date, by the amount of such excess.
To the extent the amount of the Convertible Note is reduced to zero, Seller
shall pay to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately  available funds to such
account or accounts as Buyer may designate to Seller in writing,  an amount
equal to such  underfunding  not so applied in reduction of the Convertible
Note, plus interest  thereon at the rate of interest per annum equal to the
prime rate as announced  by JP Morgan Chase Bank,  N.A. on the date payment
is to be made,  calculated  from the Closing Date through the date on which
payment is made.

          (t) Buyer shall be exclusively  responsible  for any Liability to
the extent  attributable  to the employment or termination of employment of
any Transferred  Employee  following the Closing Date,  including,  but not
limited to, any Liability attributable to service required to be recognized
pursuant to Section 5.4(b).

     5.5  Reasonable  Best  Efforts.  Upon the  terms  and  subject  to the
conditions set forth in this Purchase Agreement, each of the parties hereto
agrees to use its  reasonable  best efforts to take,  or cause to be taken,
all actions,  and to do, or cause to be done,  and to assist and  cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,  proper or advisable
to  consummate  and  make  effective,   in  the  most  expeditious   manner
practicable,  the transactions  contemplated by this Purchase Agreement and
the  Collateral  Agreements,  including  using  reasonable  best efforts to
accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable,  (ii) the
obtaining  of  all  necessary  actions  or  nonactions,  waivers,  permits,
consents  and  approvals  from  Governmental  Bodies  and the making of all
necessary  registrations,   notices,  amendments,  applications  and  other
filings (including filings with Governmental Bodies, if any) and the taking
of all steps as may be necessary  to obtain an approval or waiver from,  or
to avoid an  action  or  proceeding  by any  Governmental  Body,  (iii) the
obtaining of all necessary  consents,  approvals,  releases or waivers from
Third  Parties,  including  consent  to and  approval  of the  novation  or
assignment of Contracts,  (iv) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,  challenging this Purchase
Agreement or the  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,
including  seeking to have any stay or temporary  restraining order entered
by any Governmental Body vacated or reversed (v) the execution and delivery
of any  additional  instruments  necessary to consummate  the  transactions
contemplated  by, and to fully carry out the  purposes  of,  this  Purchase
Agreement and the Collateral  Agreements,  (vi) the  implementation  of the
provisions of Section 5.4 in a manner that avoids the  interruption  of the
provision of pay and employee  benefits from and after the Closing Date and
(vii) the provision by Seller to Buyer of at least two weeks advance notice
of any material  Benefit Plan changes that impact Business  Employees.  Not
limiting the generality of the foregoing,  Seller and Buyer shall, or shall
cause any ultimate  parent entity with respect  thereto to, use  reasonable
best efforts to (a) take promptly all actions necessary to make the filings
required under the HSR Act or Competition Laws of any foreign  jurisdiction
(and in any event each party  shall,  or shall  cause its  ultimate  parent
entity to, use its  reasonable  best efforts to, make such filings no later
than the date that is 10 Business Days after the date  hereof),  (b) comply
at  the  earliest   practicable   date  with  any  request  for  additional
information  received  by  Seller  or Buyer or  their  Affiliates  from the
Federal Trade  Commission or the  Antitrust  Division of the  Department of
Justice  pursuant  to  the  HSR  Act or  Competition  Laws  of any  foreign
jurisdiction,  and (c) cooperate  with each other in connection  with their
respective  filings under the HSR Act and in connection  with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry concerning the transactions  contemplated by
this Purchase  Agreement  commenced by either the Federal Trade Commission,
the  Antitrust  Division of the  Department  of Justice or state  attorneys
general or any foreign jurisdiction.  For purposes of this Section 5.5, the
reasonable  best efforts of any party hereto shall include  payment by such
party (or its Affiliates) of all standard fees and expenses which are legal
obligations  of  such  party  related



                                     51
<PAGE>

to obtaining  any consents  from a  Governmental  Body,  including all fees
incurred  in  connection  with  all  filings  under  any  Competition  Laws
(including the HSR Act and EC Common Market).

     5.6 Contacts with Suppliers and  Customers.  With the prior consent of
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,  Buyer
and its  representatives  shall have the right to contact key suppliers and
distributors and technology partners of the Business.

     5.7 Sale by Buyer of Inventory Marked With Avaya's Name. Seller grants
to Buyer a license to use the Licensed Avaya  Trademarks in accordance with
the terms and conditions set forth in the  Transitional  Trademark  License
Agreement  attached  hereto as  Exhibit  C-6,  and other  than as set forth
therein,  in no event shall Buyer or any  Affiliate  of Buyer  advertise or
hold itself out as Avaya or an Affiliate of Avaya after the Closing Date.

     5.8  Non-Solicitation of Employees.  Seller shall not, and shall cause
its  representatives  and Affiliates not to, for a period of two years from
the date hereof, directly or indirectly,  solicit the employment (including
as a consultant or  independent  contractor)  of, or engage as an employee,
consultant or independent  contractor,  any  Transferred  Employee  without
Buyer's prior written consent.  The term "solicit the employment" shall not
be deemed to include  generalized  searches  for  employees  through  media
advertisements,  employment  firms or  otherwise  that are not  focused  on
Persons  employed by Buyer or any  successor.  This  restriction  shall not
apply  to  solicitations   directed  at  any  Transferred   Employee  whose
employment with Buyer or its successor has theretofore  been  involuntarily
terminated by Buyer or its successor after the Closing.

     5.9  Home  Depot.   Buyer   acknowledges  that  Seller  has  sold  and
transferred to Home Depot the Home Depot Parcel  pursuant to the Home Depot
Purchase Agreement and, as the owner of the Nebraska Property,  is bound to
cooperate  in certain  matters with Home Depot with respect to the Nebraska
Property and the development of the Home Depot Parcel, as more particularly
set forth in the Amendment to the Home Depot Purchase Agreement executed by
Seller on March 18, 2003 and  executed by Home Depot on March 28, 2003 (the
"Home Depot  Amendment").  Seller  shall  assign to Buyer,  and Buyer shall
assume,  the rights and obligations of Seller under Paragraph 4 of the Home
Depot  Amendment  to the extent  relating  to the  Nebraska  Property,  but
specifically  excluding  any rights and  obligations  relating  to the Home
Depot  Parcel  or  the  Avaya  Southeast  Property.  Without  limiting  the
foregoing,  (i) Buyer shall assume the  obligation to maintain the separate
access  road  to  Seller's   facility  located  on  the  Nebraska  Property
referenced in Paragraph 4(a) of the Home Depot Amendment, (ii) Seller shall
assign to Buyer all  easements,  rights  and  benefits  appurtenant  to the

Agreement),  the escrow agreement  referenced in Paragraph 4(h) of the Home
Depot  Amendment,  and that letter  agreement  dated April 15, 2003 between
Avaya and Home Depot regarding  culvert design and tree  relocation  costs,
and (iii) Seller shall remain solely  responsible  for all  liabilities and
obligations relating to the Avaya Southeast Property, whether arising under

all documented  out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with
the Home Depot  Purchase  Agreement,  the REA, the Home Depot Parcel and/or

herein,  Buyer shall only assume the obligations and liabilities  under the
REA  which  are  applicable  to  the  owner  of  property  which  is  being
transferred to Buyer pursuant to this Purchase Agreement.

     (a) Parent agrees to use its commercially  reasonable efforts to take,

necessary to consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  by the



                                     52
<PAGE>

Commitment  Letter.  Parent will  promptly  notify Seller in writing of any
termination   of  the  Commitment   Letter  or  any  proposed   changes  or
modifications  to the  Commitment  Letter that would  materially  adversely
affect the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by

the material terms or conditions of the Commitment  Letter  relating to the
amount or closing  conditions  thereof or in a manner  reasonably likely to
materially  adversely  affect the  ability of Parent to  consummate  of the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Purchase  Agreement  without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.

          (b) If at any time  prior  to the  termination  of this  Purchase
Agreement the financing  contemplated by the Commitment Letter is no longer
available  to  Parent,  Parent  agrees to use its  commercially  reasonable
efforts  to  arrange  alternative  financing  on terms  which  in  Parent's
judgment are at least as favorable to Parent as those  contemplated  by the
Commitment Letter to enable Parent and Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Purchase Agreement and the Collateral Documents.

          (c) Seller  shall use its  commercially  reasonable  efforts  and
cooperate with Buyer and its agents and  representatives in connection with
the financing  contemplated  by the  Commitment  Letter or, as  applicable,
alternative financing  arrangements,  including providing reasonable access
to the Purchased Assets, Business Records, officers,  directors,  employees
agents  and  other   representatives  of  Seller,  and  using  commercially
reasonable  efforts to cause its officers,  directors,  employees,  agents,
legal advisors,  auditors and other representatives to assist and cooperate
with the preparation of a standard confidential  memorandum and participate
in and  cooperate  with  the  marketing  of any  loan  syndication  and any
meetings with rating agencies and prospective lenders; provided that Parent

connection with providing such cooperation or assistance.

any notice or other  communication from any Governmental Body in connection
with  the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Purchase  Agreement  or the

that such  distributor,  value-added  reseller or supplier  intends to: (A)
cease doing business with the Business; (B) materially reduce the amount of
business it now does with the Business;  or (C) materially  alter the terms
and  conditions  pursuant  to which  business  will be  conducted  with the
Business.  Seller will  promptly  advise  Buyer in writing of (i) any event
known by Seller that would render any  representation or warranty of Seller
contained in this Agreement untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or
(ii) any  change,  condition  or event that has had or could be  reasonably
expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.  No disclosure  pursuant
to this Section 5.11,  however,  shall be deemed to amend or supplement the

or breach of covenant.

     5.12 Third Party Confidentiality Agreements.  Within two Business Days
after the date hereof,  Seller shall  request that all Persons who received

to, solicit offers,  inquiries or proposals from, disclose  information to,
afford any access to or negotiate or participate in discussions (and Seller

discussions  or  negotiations  that are  ongoing)  with,  other  Persons in
connection with the possible sale,  disposition,  recapitalization or other

the  Closing  Date,  it will not,  and will  cause its  Affiliates  not to,
directly or indirectly,  sell, distribute,  make or have made any products,
or engage in any business or other  endeavor of a kind which  competes with
the Business as currently  conducted,  in any area of the world;  provided,
however,  that neither Seller nor any Seller  Subsidiary shall be prevented

products sold by, or as part of maintenance or service offerings of, Seller
or any of its  Affiliates  so long as  Seller  and  its  Affiliates  do not
private  label  any such  Components,  use any  marks of the  Seller or its
Affiliates to identify such Components nor otherwise represent or market to
customers that Seller or any of its Affiliates has designed or manufactured
such  Components;  or (e)  enforcing  its rights under that certain  patent
license   agreement   between  Avaya  Licensing   Corporation  and  Panduit
Corporation,  effective as of December 4, 2002, that certain patent license
agreement  between Avaya Licensing  Corporation  and Leviton  Manufacturing
Co.,  Inc.,  effective  as of November 15,  2002,  and that certain  patent

Superior Modular Products  Incorporated  dated June 1, 1995 (as assigned to
and  assumed by Seller),  subject to the  limitations  in the  Intellectual
Property License Agreement.

     5.15 Collateral Agreements.  Prior to the Closing Date, Seller, on the
one hand, and Parent and Buyer, on the other hand,  shall negotiate in good
faith (a) the form of the  Convertible  Note to be  delivered  to Seller at
Closing  pursuant  to Section 2.3 in  accordance  with the summary of terms
thereof set forth on Exhibit G attached hereto, (b) the Transition Services
Agreement  including  the  schedules for the services to be attached to the
Transition  Services  Agreement  and (c) the time periods to be used in the
Transitional  Trademark License  Agreement.  With respect to the Transition

the services currently provided to the Business,  the cost of such services
will not be in excess of One  Million Two Hundred  Fifty  Thousand  Dollars
($1,250,000)  per month.  The parties  acknowledge that Parent or Buyer may
require  certain  services deemed critical to the operation of the Business
(the "Critical  Services") and such Critical Services shall be subject to a
term extension as Parent or Buyer reasonably  determine and subject to cost
terms as are mutually agreeable, provided, that Critical Services shall not
include any legal or accounting  (excluding  payroll) services.  Subject to
the  limitations  set forth in this Section 5.15,  Seller agrees to provide
all  services  necessary  for  Parent  and Buyer to  operate  the  Business
substantially the same as at the signing of this Purchase Agreement.

     5.16 Financial Statements.  Prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver
to Buyer  true and  complete  copies of the  audited  balance  sheets as of

                                     54
<PAGE>

period  then  ended,  in each case in  conformity  with GAAP  applied  on a
consistent basis  throughout the periods covered thereby.  Seller shall use
its  reasonable  best  efforts  to  cause  PWC to give  Buyer  and  Buyer's

License),  Seller  shall make any and all  payments due with respect to the
Licenses set forth on Schedule 3.12(c).

Agreement,  the execution of the Supply  Agreement shall not be a condition
precedent to the obligations of the parties under this Purchase Agreement.

     5.20  Apportionments.  The following  items will be adjusted as of the
Closing Date (or as soon  thereafter  as is  reasonably  feasible,  and the

Seller or a Seller  Subsidiary  the  ownership of which is  transferred  to
Buyer.

          (b)  Notwithstanding  this  Article  VI  or  the  Confidentiality
Agreement,  each party hereto (and each employee,  representative  or other
agent of each party) may disclose to any and all Persons, the tax treatment
and  tax  structure  of the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Purchase
Agreement  and all materials of any kind  (including  opinions or other tax
analyses)  that are provided to such party  relating to such tax  treatment

the parties agrees that it will keep  confidential all Proprietary  Subject
Matter of the other party or its Affiliates  that is received from, or made
available  by,  the  other  party,  in  the  course  of  the   transactions
contemplated  hereby,  including,  for  purposes of this  Section  6.2, (i)

any obligation with respect to any such Proprietary Subject Matter that:

               (i) at the time of disclosure was already known to Seller or
Parent  and  Buyer,  as the case  may be,  other  than as a result  of this
transaction,  free of restriction as evidenced by documentation in Seller's

               (iii) is received by Seller or Parent and Buyer, as the case
may be, from a Third Party without  similar  restriction and without breach
of any agreement,  other than  Proprietary  Subject Matter  included in the
Purchased Assets in the case of Seller's obligation; or

               (iv) to the extent it is  independently  developed by Seller
or Parent and Buyer,  as the case may be,  other than  Proprietary  Subject
Matter included in the Purchased Assets in the case of Seller's obligation.



                                     56
<PAGE>

          (c) If Seller (or any of its  Affiliates) or Parent and Buyer (or
any of their Affiliates),  as the case may be, is requested or required (by
oral  question,  interrogatory,   request  for  information  or  documents,
subpoena,  civil  investigative  demand or similar process) to disclose any
Proprietary  Subject  Matter of the other party,  such party will  promptly
notify the other party of such request or  requirement  and will  cooperate
with such other  party such that such other  party may seek an  appropriate
protective  order or other  appropriate  remedy.  If, in the  absence  of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver  hereunder,  a party (or any of
its Affiliates) is in the opinion of its counsel  compelled to disclose the
Proprietary  Subject  Matter of the other  party or else  stand  liable for
contempt or suffer other censure or significant penalty, such party (or its
Affiliate) may disclose only so much of the  Proprietary  Subject Matter to
the Person  compelling  disclosure as is required by Law.  Seller or Parent
and  Buyer,  as the case may be,  will  exercise  its (and  will  cause its
Affiliates  to  exercise  their)   reasonable  best  efforts  to  obtain  a
protective order or other reliable  assurance that  confidential  treatment
will be accorded to such Proprietary Subject Matter.

          (d)  Except to the extent  that  disclosure  thereof is  required
under accounting,  stock exchange or federal  securities or labor relations
Laws  disclosure  obligations,  the terms and  conditions  of this Purchase
Agreement and the Collateral Agreements, and all attachments and amendments
hereto and thereto shall be considered Proprietary Subject Matter protected
under this Article VI.  Notwithstanding  anything in this Article VI to the
contrary,  in the event that any such  Proprietary  Subject  Matter is also
subject to a limitation on  disclosure or use contained in another  written
agreement between Parent or Buyer and Seller or their respective Affiliates
that is more restrictive than the limitation  contained in this Article VI,
then the limitation in such other  agreement  shall  supersede this Article
VI. Upon the Closing,  Seller's  Proprietary Subject Matter included in the
Purchased Assets shall be the property of Buyer, and Parent and Buyer shall
have no  obligations  to Seller  pursuant to this  Article VI with  respect
thereto;  provided however,  nothing in the foregoing paragraph shall alter
any rights or obligations set forth in the  Intellectual  Property  License
Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit C-1.

     8.4  Subsequent  Closings.   Notwithstanding  any  provision  in  this
Purchase  Agreement to the contrary,  in the event that all the  conditions
set  forth  in  Sections  8.2  and 8.3  have  been  satisfied,  and all the
conditions set forth in Section 8.1 have been satisfied with respect to the
portion of the Business conducted by Seller and the Seller  Subsidiaries in
the  United  States  of  America,   the  Commonwealth  of  Australia,   the
Netherlands,  Singapore and the Republic of Ireland, but the conditions set
forth in Section 8.1 have not been satisfied with respect to the portion of
the Business conducted by Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries in one or more
other  jurisdictions,  Seller and Parent and Buyer agree to consummate  the
Closing with respect to all assets and  Liabilities of the Business in such
jurisdictions with respect to which the conditions set forth in Section 8.1
have been satisfied (the "Primary Closing"). In connection with the Primary
Closing the parties shall enter into the Intellectual  Property  Agreements
covering the Business  Intellectual  Property on a worldwide basis, even if
the other assets and  Liabilities  in certain  countries are to be conveyed
and assumed in a Subsequent  Closing.  In the event of the Primary Closing,
Seller shall sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer
shall purchase,  acquire and accept from Seller, those Purchased Assets and
Assumed  Liabilities  constituting the portion of the Business conducted in
such  jurisdictions  with  respect  to which  the  conditions  set forth in
Section 8.1 have been  satisfied,  and Buyer shall pay the  Purchase  Price
minus the net book value of the Purchased Assets (as reflected in the books
and records of Seller or the  applicable  Seller  Subsidiary  at such time)
that were not so transferred,  other than the Avaya Tianjin  shares,  which
shall be equal to the value on Schedule 8.5. Such reduction,  if any, shall
first reduce the amount of the Convertible Note, dollar for dollar,  and to
the  extent  the amount of the  Convertible  Note is  reduced to zero,  any
remaining  shortfall shall reduce the Cash Payment,  dollar for dollar. The
closing or  closings  with  respect  to the  Purchased  Assets and  Assumed
Liabilities not sold, transferred,  assigned,  conveyed and delivered,  and
purchased,   acquired  and  accepted,  at  the  Primary  Closing  (each,  a
"Subsequent  Closing")  shall  occur  from  time  to time  as  promptly  as
practical after the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 have been satisfied
with  respect to the portion of the Business  conducted  in any  particular
jurisdiction. At each Subsequent Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller and the
Seller  Subsidiaries,  as  applicable,  the net book value of the Purchased
Assets (as  reflected in the books and records of Seller or the  applicable
Seller Subsidiary at such time), other than the Avaya Tianjin shares, which
shall be equal to the value on  Schedule  8.5,  being  transferred  at such
Subsequent  Closing  and assume all  related  Assumed  Liabilities  at such
Subsequent  Closing. In no event shall the conditions set forth in Sections
8.2(a) and 8.3(a) be deemed to apply to any Subsequent Closing, and, except
as  provided  in  Section  8.5  below,  in no  event  shall  the  aggregate
consideration paid by Buyer to Seller and its Subsidiaries,  as applicable,
at the  Primary  Closing and all  Subsequent  Closings be less than or more
than the Purchase Price.  The sale,  assignment,  transfer,  conveyance and
delivery,  and the purchase,  acquisition and acceptance,  of the Purchased
Assets and the Assumed  Liabilities  at each  Subsequent  Closing  shall be
effected pursuant to short-form bills of sale and assumption agreements, in
each case in such form as Seller and Buyer  mutually  agree  satisfies  the
requirements of applicable  local Law. From and after the Primary  Closing,
the entirety of the Business (including that portion operated by



                                     60
<PAGE>

Seller and the Seller  Subsidiaries)  shall be operated for the benefit and
detriment of Buyer in accordance with Section 2.6.

     8.5 Sale of Avaya Tianjin  Shares.  If the  Transferred  Avaya Tianjin
Shares are transferred to any Third Party in accordance with the applicable
provisions of any existing contractual  obligations of Seller or any Seller
Subsidiary  (or the applicable  provisions of the joint venture  agreement,
limited liability  company agreement or other governing  documents of Avaya
Tianjin), then if the purchase price received by Seller is greater than the
value of the Transferred Avaya Tianjin Shares as set forth on Schedule 8.5,
Seller  shall pay to Buyer 50% of the amount by which such  purchase  price
exceeds such value. Any payments  required by the preceding  sentence shall
be made by wire transfer of immediately  available funds within 10 Business
Days after  written  notice  from  Seller is  received  by Buyer (with such
written notice detailing the material terms and purchase price with respect
to any transfer of  Transferred  Avaya  Tianjin  Shares to a Third  Party);
provided  that such  notice  will be sent by Seller as soon as  practicable
after the  receipt  by Seller of the  purchase  price  with  respect to any
transfer  of  Transferred  Avaya  Tianjin  Shares  to a  Third  Party.  Any
Transferred  Avaya Tianjin  Shares that are  transferred to any Third Party
shall no longer be  considered  a  Purchased  Asset  for  purposes  of this
Purchase  Agreement and, as of the date of such transfer,  the  Convertible
Note  shall be deemed to be  reduced  downward  by the  amount set forth on
Schedule  8.5,  or  to  the  extent  that  the  Convertible   Note  is  not
outstanding, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount set forth on Schedule 8.5
in cash by wire transfer of immediately  available funds to such account or
accounts as Buyer may designate in writing.

no further  action  determination  from any  Governmental  Bodies that have
asserted jurisdiction over the Designated Remedial Action.

          (c) The indemnification  provided in this Article IX shall be the
sole and exclusive  remedy after the Closing Date for damages  available to
the  parties  to this  Purchase  Agreement  for breach of any of the terms,
conditions,  representations  or warranties  contained  herein,  any right,
claim or action arising from the transactions contemplated by this Purchase
Agreement or with respect to the Designated  Remedial Action,  other than a
claim or action based on fraud or intentional misrepresentation;  provided,
however,  this exclusive  remedy for damages does not preclude a party from
bringing an action for specific  performance or other  equitable  remedy to
require a party to perform its obligations under this Purchase Agreement or
any Collateral Agreement.

          (d) All  parties  shall use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to
mitigate  their  damages.

          (e) If there is any outstanding  balance on the Convertible Note,
any amounts payable by Seller to a Buyer  Indemnified Party with respect to
its  indemnification  obligations  under  this  Article  IX shall  first be
applied to repay any outstanding amount of the Convertible Note, dollar for
dollar,  until  the  Convertible  Note is  repaid  in full.  The  rights to
indemnification  under this  Article IX shall not  otherwise  be subject to
set-off for any claim by the  Indemnifying  Party  against any  Indemnified
Party,  whether  or not  arising  from the same event  giving  rise to such
Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification.

          (f) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Purchase Agreement
to the  contrary,  no party  shall be  liable  to the  other  party for any
special, punitive, exemplary or consequential loss or damage arising out of
this Purchase Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be
construed  to preclude  recovery by the  Indemnified  Party with respect to
Losses (i)  directly  incurred  from Third Party  Claims or (ii) for actual
lost profits or incidental damages.

     9.6  General Procedures for Indemnification.
          --------------------------------------

          (a) If any third party shall notify any Buyer  Indemnified  Party
or Seller  Indemnified  Party seeking  indemnification  under this Purchase
Agreement  (the  "Indemnified  Party") with respect to any matter (a "Third
Party  Claim") which may give rise to a claim for  indemnification  against
any other party (the "Indemnifying  Party") under this Article IX, then the
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify each Indemnifying  Party thereof in
writing;  provided,  however,  that no delay or  failure on the part of the
Indemnified  Party in notifying  any  Indemnifying  Party shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to
the extent) the  Indemnifying  Party thereby is actually  prejudiced.  Such
notice shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail,  together
with supporting documentation.

          (b) Any  Indemnifying  Party  will have the  right to defend  the
Indemnified  Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably  satisfactory  to the  Indemnified  Party  so  long  as (i)  the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within 15 days
after the Indemnified  Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim that
the  Indemnifying  Party  will  indemnify  the  Indemnified  Party from and
against any Loss the Indemnified  Party may suffer resulting from,  arising
out of,  relating to, based upon,  or caused by the Third Party Claim,  and
(ii) the Third  Party  Claim  involves  only  money  damages  or both money
damages and equitable  relief against the Indemnified  Party that cannot be
severed, where the claims for money damages are the primary claims asserted
by the Third Party and the claims for  equitable  relief are  incidental to
the claims for money damages.

          (c) So long as the  Indemnifying  Party is conducting the defense
of the  Third  Party  Claim in  accordance  with  Section  9.6(b),  (i) the
Indemnified  Party  may  retain  separate  co-counsel  at its sole cost and
expense and  participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim,  (ii) the
Indemnified  Party shall not consent to the entry of any  judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party
shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written  consent of
the Indemnified  Party unless such settlement or judgment relates solely to
monetary damages. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Indemnified
Party's prior written consent, enter into any compromise or settlement that
(i)  commits  the  Indemnified  Party to take,  or to forbear to take,  any
action  and/or (ii) does not  provide for a complete  release by such Third
Party of the Indemnified Party.

          (d) In the event any of the conditions in Section 9.6(b) above is
not satisfied,  however,  (i) the Indemnified  Party may defend against the
Third  Party  Claim  in  any  manner  it  may  deem  appropriate  (and  the
Indemnified  Party need not consult with,  or obtain any consent from,  any
Indemnifying Party in connection therewith), (ii) the Indemnified Party may
(y) consent to the entry of



                                     64
<PAGE>

any judgment or enter into any  settlement  with  respect to the  equitable
relief  sought  in the  Third  Party  Claim  in  any  manner  it  may  deem
appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any
consent  from,  any  Indemnifying  Party in connection  therewith)  and (z)
consent  to the entry of any  judgment  or enter into any  settlement  with
respect to the monetary damages sought in the Third Party Claim without the
consent of the  Indemnifying  Party,  (iii) the  Indemnifying  Party  shall
reimburse the Indemnified  Party promptly and periodically for the costs of
defending  against the Third Party Claim (including  reasonable  attorneys'
fees and expenses), and (iv) the Indemnifying Party will remain responsible
for any Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out
of, relating to, based upon, in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party
Claim to the fullest extent provided in this Article IX.

Liabilities.

     10.3 Entire  Agreement;  Modification.  The  agreement of the parties,
which  consists of this  Purchase  Agreement  (including  the Schedules and
Exhibits  hereto)  and the  Collateral  Agreements,  sets  forth the entire
agreement and  understanding  between the parties and  supersedes any prior

the remaining  provisions  shall remain in full force and effect unless the
deletion of such  provision  shall cause this Purchase  Agreement to become

executed  in any number of  counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed an

extent that any such party shall be so  obligated by Law, in which case the
other party shall be advised  and the  parties  shall use their  reasonable

issued;   provided,   however,   that  the  foregoing  shall  not  preclude

hereto as partners or as  participants  in a joint  venture.  This Purchase
Agreement  shall  not  provide  Third  Parties  with  any  remedy,   claim,
liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right in excess of those
existing without reference to the terms of this Purchase Agreement. Nothing

<PAGE>

authorized officer or employee,  whether before or after the action of such
party; provided,  however, that such action shall be evidenced by a written
instrument  duly  executed on behalf of such party by such duly  authorized
officer or employee. The failure of either party to enforce at any time any
provision of this Purchase  Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver
of such  provision  nor shall it in any way  affect  the  validity  of this
Purchase  Agreement or the right of such party  thereafter  to enforce each
and  every  such  provision.  No  waiver  of any  breach  of this  Purchase
Agreement  shall be held to  constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent
