</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;), dated as of June&nbsp;3, 2008, is
among W-H Energy Services, Inc., a Texas corporation (the &#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;), Smith International,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Parent</U>&#148;), and Whitehall Acquisition Corp., a Texas
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (&#147;<U>Acquisition</U>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the &#147;<U>Company Board</U>&#148;) has, in light of
and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, unanimously (i)&nbsp;deemed this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Mergers, to be in the best
interests of the shareholders of the Company, (ii)&nbsp;approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Mergers, in all respects and (iii)&nbsp;resolved to
recommend that the shareholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares thereunder to
Acquisition and that the shareholders of the Company approve and adopt this Agreement and the
Mergers;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, it is proposed that Acquisition shall commence an exchange
offer (the &#147;<U>Offer</U>&#148;) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Company (the &#147;<U>Shares</U>&#148;) in which each Share together with the
associated Right (as defined below) accepted by Acquisition in accordance with the terms of the
Offer will be exchanged for the following consideration from Acquisition, subject to the
adjustments set forth in Section&nbsp;1.1(c), (d)&nbsp;and (e), at the election of the holder of such Share:
(i)&nbsp;for each Share with respect to which a Mixed Election has been made, the Per Share Mixed
Election Consideration, (ii)&nbsp;for each Share with respect to which a Cash Election has been made,
the Per Share Cash Election Consideration and (iii)&nbsp;for each Share with respect to which a Common
Stock Election has been made, the Per Share Stock Election Consideration (each as defined in
Section&nbsp;1.1(b));
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company has agreed, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
that following the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Acquisition will be merged with and into the
Company with the Company as the surviving corporation, as described in Article&nbsp;2 of this Agreement
(the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;);
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, as soon as practicable following the Merger, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation (as defined in Section&nbsp;2.1) to be merged with and into a wholly-owned limited liability
company subsidiary of Parent (the &#147;<U>Second Merger</U>&#148; and, together with the Merger, the
&#147;<U>Mergers</U>&#148;), with such subsidiary surviving the Second Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent; and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Offer, taken
together with the Mergers, qualify as a &#147;reorganization&#148; within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;), and that this
Agreement constitute a &#147;plan of reorganization&#148; for purposes of Sections&nbsp;354 and 361 of the Code;

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article&nbsp;7
and none of the events or conditions set forth in Annex A shall have occurred, as promptly as
reasonably practicable (but in no event later than 20&nbsp;days after the date hereof), Parent shall
cause Acquisition to commence, and Acquisition shall commence (within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;14d-2
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;<U>Exchange Act</U>&#148;)), the Offer. In
the Offer, each Share together with the associated Right, accepted by Acquisition in accordance
with the terms of the Offer shall, subject to the adjustments set forth in Section&nbsp;1.1(c), (d)&nbsp;and
(e), be exchanged for the right to receive from Acquisition, at the election of the holder of such
Share pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.1(b): (X)&nbsp;the Per Share Mixed Election Consideration, (Y)&nbsp;the Per
Share Stock Election Consideration or (Z)&nbsp;the Per Share Cash Election Consideration, plus, in the
case of (X)&nbsp;or (Y), cash in lieu of fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
Section&nbsp;1.1(e), without interest. Parent shall cause Acquisition to accept for payment, and
Acquisition shall accept for payment, Shares which have been validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable following the Expiration Date. The obligation of
Acquisition to accept for payment and pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject only to (1)&nbsp;the condition that the sum of the number of Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn shall be at least
66<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">2</SUP>/<SUB style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-bottom">3</SUB>% of the Shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis (the
&#147;<U>Minimum Condition</U>&#148;) and (2)&nbsp;the other conditions set forth in Annex A hereto. Acquisition
expressly reserves the right to increase the amount of consideration payable in the Offer and to
waive any condition of the Offer, except the Minimum Condition. Without the prior written consent
of the Company, Acquisition shall not decrease the amount of consideration payable in the Offer or
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the number of Shares sought to be
purchased in the Offer, impose additional conditions to the Offer, reduce the time period during
which the Offer shall remain open or waive the Minimum Condition. The Company agrees that no
Shares held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer.

to specify (i)&nbsp;the number of Shares as to which such holder desires to make a Mixed Election,
(ii)&nbsp;the number of Shares as to which such holder desires to make a Cash Election and (iii)&nbsp;the
number of Shares as to which such holder desires to make a Common Stock Election. Each Share with
respect to which an election to receive a combination of stock and cash (a &#147;<U>Mixed
Election</U>&#148;) has been validly made and not revoked or lost shall be exchanged for the combination
(which combination shall hereinafter be referred to as the &#147;<U>Per Share Mixed Election

Stock</U>&#148;). Each Share with respect to which an election to receive cash (a &#147;<U>Cash

without interest (the &#147;<U>Per Share Cash Election Consideration</U>&#148;), subject to adjustment in
accordance with Section&nbsp;1.1(c). Each Share with respect to which an election to receive stock (a

for 1.199 shares of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock
(the &#147;<U>Per Share Stock Election Consideration</U>&#148;), subject to adjustment in accordance with
Section&nbsp;1.1(d). Any Shares which are validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn, and which
are not the subject of a valid Election (each such Share, a &#147;<U>No Election Share</U>&#148;), shall be
treated in accordance with Section&nbsp;1.1(f). Any Mixed Election, Cash Election or Common Stock
Election shall be referred to herein as an &#147;<U>Election</U>.&#148; All Elections shall be made on a
form furnished by Acquisition for that purpose, which form may be part of the letter of transmittal
accompanying the Offer. In order to be deemed an effective Election, any such Forms of Election

other representative capacities may submit multiple Forms of Election on behalf of their respective

Shares (or fractions thereof) subject to a Cash Election, other than that number exchanged for the
Per Share Cash Election Consideration in accordance with this Section&nbsp;1.1(c), shall be exchanged

Elections multiplied by the Per Share Cash Election Consideration. The maximum aggregate amount of
cash consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer and the Merger shall be $1,636,156,000 (such

Maximum Cash Consideration exceed the product of the number of Shares issued and outstanding (other
