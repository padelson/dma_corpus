In the Offer, each Share together with the associated Right, accepted by Acquisition in accordance with the terms of the Offer shall, subject to the adjustments set forth in Section 1.1(c), (d) and (e), be exchanged for the right to receive from Acquisition, at the election of the holder of such Share pursuant to Section 1.1(b): (X) the Per Share Mixed Election Consideration, (Y) the Per Share Stock Election Consideration or (Z) the Per Share Cash Election Consideration, plus, in the case of (X) or (Y), cash in lieu of fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.1(e), without interest. Parent shall cause Acquisition to accept for payment, and Acquisition shall accept for payment, Shares which have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable following the Expiration Date. The obligation of Acquisition to accept for payment and pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to (1) the condition that the sum of the number of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn shall be at least 662/3% of the Shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") and (2) the other conditions set forth in Annex A hereto. Acquisition expressly reserves the right to increase the amount of consideration payable in the Offer and to waive any condition of the Offer, except the Minimum Condition. Without the prior written consent of the Company, Acquisition shall not decrease the amount of consideration payable in the Offer or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, impose additional conditions to the Offer, reduce the time period during which the Offer shall remain open or waive the Minimum Condition. The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer. 

  

 (b) Subject to Sections 1.1(c), (d) and (e), each holder of Shares shall be entitled to elect to specify (i) the number of Shares as to which such holder desires to make a Mixed Election, (ii) the number of Shares as to which such holder desires to make a Cash Election and (iii) the number of Shares as to which such holder desires to make a Common Stock Election. Each Share with respect to which an election to receive a combination of stock and cash (a " _Mixed Election_ ") has been validly made and not revoked or lost shall be exchanged for the combination (which combination shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Per Share Mixed Election Consideration_ ") of (A) $56.10 in cash, without interest (the " _Per Share Mixed Election_   _Cash Amount_ ") and (B) 0.48 shares of the common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent, 

   ##### 

  

 

together with the associated preferred share purchase rights (the " _Parent
Common Stock_ "). Each Share with respect to which an election to receive
cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been validly made and not revoked or lost
shall be exchanged for $93.55 in cash, without interest (the " _Per Share
Cash Election Consideration_ "), subject to adjustment in accordance with
Section 1.1(c). Each Share with respect to which an election to receive stock
(a " _Common Stock Election_ ") has been validly made and not revoked or lost
shall be exchanged for 1.199 shares of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Per Share Stock Election
Consideration_ "), subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 1.1(d).
Any Shares which are validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn, and
which are not the subject of a valid Election (each such Share, a " _No
Election Share_ "), shall be treated in accordance with Section 1.1(f). Any
Mixed Election, Cash Election or Common Stock Election shall be referred to
herein as an " _Election_." All Elections shall be made on a form furnished
by Acquisition for that purpose, which form may be part of the letter of
transmittal accompanying the Offer. In order to be deemed an effective
Election, any such Forms of Election must be delivered to Acquisition
together with any Shares validly tendered on or prior to the Expiration Date.
Holders of record of Shares who hold such Shares as nominees, trustees or
in other representative capacities may submit multiple Forms of Election on
behalf of their respective beneficial holders. 

   

 (c) In the event that, after all Elections are taken into account, the aggregate Per Share Cash Election Consideration attributable to the Cash Elections would be in excess of the Available Cash Election Consideration, then (i) for each Cash Election, the number of Shares (or fractions thereof) that shall be exchanged for the Per Share Cash Election Consideration shall be the total number of Shares subject to such Cash Election multiplied by the Cash Proration Factor and (ii) all Shares (or fractions thereof) subject to a Cash Election, other than that number exchanged for the Per Share Cash Election Consideration in accordance with this Section 1.1(c), shall be exchanged for the Per Share Stock Election Consideration. The " _Cash Proration Factor_ " means a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the Available Cash Election Consideration and (y) the denominator of which shall be the product of the aggregate number of Shares subject to Cash Elections multiplied by the Per Share Cash Election Consideration. The maximum aggregate amount of cash consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer and the Merger shall be $1,636,156,000 (such amount, the " _Maximum Cash Consideration_ "); _provided_ that in no event shall the Maximum Cash Consideration exceed the product of the number of Shares issued and outstanding (other than (1) Shares owned by Parent, Acquisition, the Company or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries, (2) Company Restricted Shares and (3) Shares acquired pursuant to Company Options that vest at the time contemplated by Section 2.10) immediately prior to the Expiration Date and the Per Share Mixed Election Cash Amount. The " _Available Cash Election Consideration_ " means the excess of (i) the product of (A) the Maximum Cash Consideration and (B) the quotient of the number of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer over the number of Shares issued and outstanding as of the Expiration Date over (ii) the sum of (I) the Aggregate Fractional Share Consideration, (II) any amounts that Parent and the Company reasonably believe may become payable to Dissenting Shareholders in accordance with Section 2.11 and (III) the product of (x) the Per Share Mixed Election Cash Amount and (y) the number of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer for which a Mixed Election was made. 

  

 (d) In the event that after all Elections are taken into account, the Available Cash Election Consideration would exceed the aggregate Per Share Cash Election Consideration 

   ##### 

  

 

attributable to the Cash Elections, then (i) the number of Shares (or
fractions thereof) subject to Common Stock Elections that shall be exchanged
for the Per Share Stock Election Consideration shall be the excess of the
total number of Shares subject to Common Stock Elections over the Stock
Proration Amount and (ii) all Shares (or fractions thereof) subject to an
actual or deemed Common Stock Election, other than that number exchanged for
the Per Share Stock Election Consideration in accordance with this Section
1.1(d), shall be exchanged for the Per Share Cash Election Consideration. The
number of Shares subject to a Common Stock Election which shall be
exchanged for the Per Share Stock Election Consideration in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence shall be allocated pro rata to the holders
of such Shares, such that each holder who tenders Shares subject to Common
Stock Elections bears its proportionate share of the proration based on the
percentage of the total Shares tendered subject to a Common Stock Election by
such holder. The " _Stock Proration Amount_ " means the quotient of (x) the
excess of the Available Cash Election Consideration over the aggregate Per
Share Cash Election Consideration attributable to the Cash Elections divided
by (y) the Per Share Cash Election Consideration. 

   

 (e) No fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Offer or the Merger, and each person that would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share shall receive, in lieu thereof, without interest, cash in the amount of such fraction multiplied by the Per Share Cash Election Consideration (the aggregate amount of cash required to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the " _Aggregate Fractional Share Consideration_ "). 

  

 (f) Each No Election Share shall be deemed to be tendered subject to the following Elections: 

  

 (i) In the event that after all Elections are taken into account, the aggregate Per Share Cash Election Consideration attributable to the Cash Elections would be in excess of the Available Cash Election Consideration, any No Election Shares will be deemed tendered subject to a Common Stock Election; 

  

 (ii) In the event that after all Elections are taken into account, the Available Cash Election Consideration would exceed the aggregate Per Share Cash Election Consideration attributable to the Cash Elections such that proration of Common Stock Elections occurs pursuant to Section 1.1(d), any No Election Shares will be deemed tendered subject to a Cash Election; provided that if deeming all No Election Shares to be tendered subject to a Cash Election would result in the aggregate Per Share Cash Election Consideration to be greater than the Available Cash Election Consideration, then any No Election Shares will be deemed tendered pro rata in part subject to a Cash Election and in part subject to a Common Stock Election such that after giving effect to such deemed Cash Elections and Common Stock Elections, no proration of Common Stock Elections occurs; and 

  

 (iii) If no proration occurs, any No Election Shares will be deemed tendered in part subject to a Cash Election and in part subject to a Common Stock Election to the extent necessary so as to cause the aggregate Per Share Cash Election Consideration to be equal to the Available Cash Election Consideration after taking into account the Cash Elections and Common Stock Elections made by those Company shareholders who affirmatively made Elections in the Offer. Any remaining available cash and Parent Common Stock allocated 

   ##### 

  

 

pursuant to this clause (iii) will be allocated on a pro rata basis among the
No Election Shares, such that each such No Election Share is exchanged for
the same proportion of cash and Parent Common Stock. 

   

 (g) Acquisition shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition to, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall include or incorporate by reference all or part of the Preliminary Prospectus, the offer to exchange, a summary advertisement and a form of transmittal letter relating to the Offer (together with any supplements or amendments thereto, collectively the " _Offer Documents_ "). Promptly thereafter, Parent and Acquisition shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares. The Offer Documents and the filing and dissemination thereof will comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities laws. Concurrently with the filing of the Offer Documents, Parent shall prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a registration statement on Form S-4 to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), the offer and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the " _S-4_ "). The S-4 will include a preliminary prospectus containing the information required under Rule 14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act (the " _Preliminary Prospectus_ "). The information provided and to be provided by the Company, Parent and Acquisition for use in the S-4 or the Offer Documents shall not, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published or sent or given to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders, as the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent, Acquisition and the Company each agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the S-4 or the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Acquisition further agrees to, and Parent shall cause Acquisition to, take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on each of the Offer Documents and the S-4 (including each amendment or supplement thereto) before it is filed with the SEC (to which Parent and Acquisition shall give reasonable and good faith consideration). Parent and Acquisition shall provide the Company, in writing, any comments (written or oral) which Parent, Acquisition or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the S-4 as promptly as practicable after receipt of such comments. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments on any such comments and proposed responses (to which Parent and Acquisition shall give reasonable and good faith consideration). 

  

 (h) Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Offer shall remain open until at least midnight, New York City time, on the twentieth business day (for this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the date the Offer is commenced (the initial " _Expiration Date_ ," and any expiration time and date established pursuant to an authorized extension of the Offer, as so extended, also an " _Expiration Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , Acquisition shall have the right, in its sole discretion, but shall not be obligated to: (i) from time to time extend the Offer for one or more periods, if at the scheduled Expiration Date any of the conditions of the Offer shall not have been satisfied or waived, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived to the extent permitted by this Agreement; (ii) extend the 

   ##### 

  

 

Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer; or (iii)
from time to time extend the Offer, if, at the scheduled Expiration Date less
than 90% of the number of Shares then outstanding on a fully diluted
basis have been validly tendered and not withdrawn. In no event shall
Acquisition be required to, or shall Parent be required to cause Acquisition
to, extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date (as hereinafter defined) and in
no such event shall Acquisition extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date
without the consent of the Company. Parent and Acquisition shall comply with
the obligations respecting prompt payment and announcement under the Exchange
Act, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Acquisition
shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition to, accept for payment, and pay
for, all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
promptly following the acceptance of such Shares for payment pursuant to the
Offer and this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 1.2. _Company Action_. 

  

 (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, unanimously (i) deemed this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Mergers, to be in the best interests of the shareholders of the Company, (ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Mergers, in all respects and such approval constitutes approval of the Offer, this Agreement and the Mergers for purposes of Article 13 of the Texas Business Corporation Act (the " _TBCA_ ") and (iii) resolved to recommend that the shareholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their Shares thereunder to Acquisition and that the shareholders of the Company approve and adopt this Agreement and the Mergers; _provided_ , that such recommendation may be withdrawn, modified or amended only to the extent permitted by Section 5.3. The Company consents to the inclusion of such recommendation and approval in the Offer Documents. 

  

 (b) The Company hereby agrees to file with the SEC on the date that Parent and Acquisition file the Offer Documents pursuant to Section 1.1(g), a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 pertaining to the Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") containing the recommendation described in Section 1.2(a). The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to mail such Schedule 14D-9 to the shareholders of the Company concurrently with the mailing of the Offer Documents. The Schedule 14D-9 will comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities laws and, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no representation is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by Parent or Acquisition in writing for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company, Parent and Acquisition each agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given 

   ##### 

  

 

a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule
14D-9 (including each amendment or supplement thereto) before it is filed
with the SEC (to which the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration). The Company shall provide Parent and Acquisition, in writing,
any comments (written or oral) which the Company or its counsel may receive
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 as promptly as
practicable after receipt of such comments. Parent and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments on any such
comments and proposed responses (to which the Company shall give reasonable
and good faith consideration). 

   

 (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company will promptly furnish Parent and Acquisition with mailing labels, security position listings and any available listing or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of a recent date and shall furnish Acquisition with such additional information and assistance (including, without limitation, updated lists of shareholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) as Acquisition or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. 

  

 SECTION 1.3. _Board of Directors and Committees; Section 14(f)_. 

  

 (a) Promptly upon the acceptance for payment by Acquisition, Parent or any of their affiliates of Shares pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Offer and from time to time thereafter, and subject to the last sentence of this Section 1.3(a), Acquisition shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors, rounded up to the nearest whole number constituting at least a majority of the directors, on the Company Board as will give Acquisition representation on the Company Board equal to the product of the number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this Section 1.3) and the percentage that such number of Shares so purchased bears to the total number of outstanding Shares, and the Company shall, upon request by Acquisition, promptly, at the CompanyÂ’s election, take all actions necessary, including increasing the size of the Company Board or securing the resignation of such number of directors, to enable AcquisitionÂ’s designees to be appointed to the Company Board and to cause AcquisitionÂ’s designees to be so appointed (the date on which the majority of the CompanyÂ’s directors are designees of Acquisition that have been effectively appointed to the Company Board in accordance herewith, the " _Board Appointment Date_ "). At such times, the Company will cause persons designated by Acquisition to constitute a majority of each committee of the Company Board, other than any committee of the Company Board established to take action under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that at least three of the members of the Company Board as of the date hereof who qualify as independent directors for purposes of the continued listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange LLC. (the " _NYSE_ ") and SEC rules and regulations (such directors, the " _Independent Incumbent Directors_ ") and who are reasonably satisfactory to Acquisition shall remain members of the Company Board until the Effective Time. If the number of Independent Incumbent Directors is reduced below three prior to the Effective Time, the remaining Independent Incumbent Directors (or if there is only one such director, that remaining director) shall be entitled to designate a person (or persons) to fill such vacancy (or vacancies) ( _provided_ each such person meets the independence requirements of the rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE and such director (or 

   ##### 

  

 

directors) shall be deemed to be an Independent Incumbent Director (or
Independent Incumbent Directors) for purposes hereof. 

   

 (b) The CompanyÂ’s obligation to appoint designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all action required pursuant to such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3 and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is required under such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3. Acquisition will supply to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by such Section and Rule. 

  

 (c) Following the election or appointment of AcquisitionÂ’s designees pursuant to this Section 1.3 and prior to the Effective Time, if there shall be any Independent Incumbent Directors, any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any extension by the Company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Acquisition or waiver of any of the CompanyÂ’s rights hereunder, or any amendment of this Agreement, or other action adversely affecting the rights of shareholders of the Company to receive the Merger Consideration (other than Parent or Acquisition), will require the concurrence of a majority of such Independent Incumbent Directors. 

  

 SECTION 1.4. _Top-Up Option_. 

  

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Acquisition an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase, at a price per share equal to the Per Share Cash Election Consideration, up to such number of Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and Acquisition and any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Acquisition immediately prior to the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one Share more than 90% of the number of Shares that will be outstanding on a fully diluted basis immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Parent or Acquisition, in whole or in part, at any time on or after the Expiration Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (i) no judgment, injunction, order or decree of any Governmental Entity shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise, (ii) the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares will not cause the Company to have more Shares outstanding than are authorized by the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company, and (iii) Acquisition has accepted for payment all Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable legal requirements of all Governmental Entities, including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act. 

  

 (b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of notice from Parent or Acquisition, as the case may be, of their intent to exercise of the Top-Up Option, notify Parent and Acquisition of the number of Shares then outstanding. The closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares will take place at a time and on a date to be specified by Parent or 

   ##### 

  

 

Acquisition, which shall be no later than one business day after the exercise
of the Top-Up Option, at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51
West 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019, unless another time, date or
place is specified by Parent or Acquisition. Parent or Acquisition, as the
case may be, shall pay the Company an amount equal to the Per Share
Cash Election Consideration multiplied by the number of Top-Up Option Shares
specified by Parent (the " _Top-Up Consideration_ "), and the Company shall,
at ParentÂ’s or AcquisitionÂ’s request, cause to be issued to Parent or
Acquisition a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. The Top-Up
Consideration may be paid by Acquisition or Parent by executing and delivering
to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the
aggregate cash purchase price for the Top-Up Shares. Any such promissory note
shall bear interest at the rate of interest per annum equal to the prime
lending rate prevailing from time to time during such period as published in
The Wall Street Journal, shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of
execution and delivery of such promissory note and may be prepaid without
premium or penalty.

 SECTION 2.2. _Effective Time_. The term " _Effective Time_ " shall mean the time of and date on which the Secretary of State of the State of Texas issues a certificate of merger in accordance with Article 5.05 of the TBCA following the filing of properly executed and certified articles of merger relating to the Merger (" _Articles of Merger_ "), or such other time and date as is permissible in accordance with the TBCA and as the Company and Parent may agree.

 SECTION 2.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the TBCA and other applicable law. 

  

 SECTION 2.5. _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read the same as the 

   ##### 

  

 

Articles of Incorporation of Acquisition, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable
law and such Articles of Incorporation, except that Article I of the Articles
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated
in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation shall be
W-H Energy Services, Inc." At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended to read the same as the Bylaws of Acquisition,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until amended in
accordance with applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws. 

   

 SECTION 2.6. _Directors_. The directors of Acquisition at the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until such directorÂ’s successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified. 

  

 SECTION 2.7. _Officers_. The officers of Acquisition at the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until such officerÂ’s successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified. 

  

 SECTION 2.8. _Conversion of Shares in the Merger_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each Share held by the Company as treasury stock, or owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. Each Share owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Election Consideration. The Per Share Stock Election Consideration paid pursuant to this Section 2.8(a) shall not be subject to, or otherwise taken into account, in calculating adjustments under Section 1.1. Unless the context otherwise requires, each reference in this Agreement to the Shares shall include the associated Rights. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Acquisition outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.8(a) or 2.8(d) or Section 2.11, each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Mixed Election Consideration, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ", which term shall include any adjustments made pursuant to Section 2.8(d)). The Merger Consideration shall not be subject to, or otherwise taken into account in calculating adjustments under Section 1.1. 

  

 (d) In the event that the sum of (i) the aggregate cash consideration to be paid pursuant to the Merger (after taking into account the cash consideration paid to holders of Shares pursuant to the Offer), including the Aggregate Fractional Share Consideration, if any, and any amounts that Parent reasonably believes may be due to Dissenting Shareholders, (ii) any other 

   ##### 

  

 

cash amounts paid to or on behalf of any holder of Shares in connection with
the Offer or the Merger, and (iii) any other amounts that are treated as
other property or money received in the exchange for purposes of Section 356
of the Code (or would be so treated if a holder of Shares also had received
Parent Stock) (the " _Aggregate Cash Consideration_ "), exceeds the Maximum
Cash Amount, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to increase the
Parent Common Stock portion thereof and decrease the cash portion thereof to
the extent necessary so as to cause the Aggregate Cash Consideration to not
exceed the Maximum Cash Consideration. It is intended that any such adjustment
be made in a manner that preserves the existence of "fixed consideration" for
purposes of Treasury Regulation Â§1.368-1T(e)(2). 

   

 SECTION 2.9. _Payment of Merger Consideration in the Merger_. 

  

 (a) From time to time following the Effective Time, as necessary to satisfy the requirements of Section 2.9(b), Parent shall deliver to such agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the benefit of the holders of Shares, (i) such number of certificates of Parent Common Stock representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 2.8 and (ii) immediately available funds in an amount not less than the portion of the cash payable pursuant to Section 2.8 to holders of the Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.8: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.9, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.9. Holders of Shares in book-entry form will be entitled to receive upon delivery to the Paying Agent of a properly completed letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration payable for each Share held by such holders in book-entry form. 

  

 (c) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such Merger Consideration as may be required pursuant to this Agreement; 

   ##### 

  

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or its Exchange Agent may, in its
discretion, require the delivery of a suitable bond or indemnity up to the
maximum amount of the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of such
Certificate. 

   

 (d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares; _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving CorporationÂ’s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record and payment date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by the Company on such Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If after the Effective Time Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 2. 

  

 (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.9(a) which remains undistributed to the shareholders of the Company for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand and any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of Parent, Acquisition, the Company or any other person shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed as of the date that is immediately prior to such time as such Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interests of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (g) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Shares until such Shares are surrendered as provided in this Section 2.9. Following such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender.

 (h) Each of Parent, Acquisition and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such 

   ##### 

  

 

payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent, Acquisition or the
Exchange Agent, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such withholding was made. 

   

 SECTION 2.10. _Stock Options and Restricted Shares in the Merger_. 

  

 (a) By virtue of the consummation of the Offer, and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to purchase Shares granted under the 1997 Stock Option Plan, as restated effective as of May 12, 2004, or the 2006 Stock Awards Plan, effective as of May 10, 2006 (collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), or pursuant to an individual award agreement, in each case that is outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the Offer (each, a " _Company Option_ " collectively, the " _Company Options_ "), to the extent outstanding and unvested at the consummation of the Offer, shall vest in full immediately prior to the consummation of the Offer (or, to the extent required, at such earlier time as shall be administratively necessary in order to allow such holders to participate in the Offer). Each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent as of the Effective Time and converted into an option (an "Adjusted Parent Option") to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as applied to each such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that is equal to the number of Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Per Share Stock Election Consideration (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole penny) equal to the per-Share exercise price of such Company Option divided by the Per Share Stock Election Consideration. Following the Effective Time, each Adjusted Parent Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the corresponding Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than as described in this Section 2.10(a). 

  

 (b) Holders of any restricted Shares granted under a Company Stock Plan or pursuant to an individual restricted stock award agreement (the " _Company Restricted Shares_ ") shall be entitled to tender such Company Restricted Shares in the Offer notwithstanding the transfer restrictions applicable thereto at the time of such tender, in the same manner as any other outstanding Shares. Any Company Restricted Shares that are not validly tendered and accepted for exchange in the Offer and which are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Mixed Election Consideration in the Merger pursuant to Sections 2.8 and 2.9 in the same manner as any other Shares which are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company will take such actions as are necessary to terminate the transfer restrictions applicable to such Company Restricted Shares contemporaneously with the acceptance for payment of Shares in the Offer or at the Effective Time of the Merger, as the case may be. 

  

 (c) The Company and Parent agree that prior to the Effective Time each of the Company Stock Plans shall be amended, to the extent possible without requiring shareholder approval of such amendments, (i) if and to the extent necessary and practicable, to reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the conversion of the Company Options 

   ##### 

  

 

pursuant to paragraph (a) above and the substitution of Parent for the
Company thereunder to the extent appropriate to effectuate the transactions
described in such paragraph and, to the extent determined by Parent, the
assumption of such arrangements by Parent, (ii) to preclude any automatic or
formulaic grant of options, restricted shares or other awards thereunder on or
after the Effective Time, and (iii) notwithstanding the preceding clauses (i)
and (ii), if and to the extent Parent so instructs the Company and subject to
compliance with applicable law and the terms of each applicable arrangement,
to terminate any or all Company Stock Plans effective immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than with respect to outstanding awards
thereunder).. 

   

 (d) The Company and Parent agree prior to the Effective Time to adopt resolutions of the Company Board or the Board of Directors of Acquisition or Parent, if and to the extent necessary, to exempt from the applicability of the short swing profit provisions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including in accordance with Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated thereunder, the treatment described hereunder of any awards under the Company Stock Plans, including any Company Options, Adjusted Parent Options or Company Restricted Shares, by virtue of the Merger or this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 2.11. _Dissenting Shares in the Merger_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder which has perfected and not withdrawn or lost its right to dissent with respect to such Share under Article 5.12 or 5.16, as applicable, of the TBCA (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Article 5.12 or 5.16, as applicable, of the TBCA. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice upon receipt by the Company of any demand for payment pursuant to Articles 5.11 and 5.12 of the TBCA and of withdrawals of such notice and any other instruments provided pursuant to applicable law (any shareholder duly making such demand, a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ "), and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by Parent, and the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. 

  

 (b) If any Dissenting Shareholder shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his or her right to dissent under Articles 5.11 or 5.16, as applicable, of the TBCA at or prior to the Effective Time, each of such holderÂ’s Shares shall be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 2.12. _Second Merger_. As soon as practicable following the Merger, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to be merged with and into a wholly owned limited liability company that is disregarded as an entity separate from Parent for federal income tax purposes, with such subsidiary (the " _Ultimate Surviving Company_ ") surviving the Second Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

All material contributions required to be made to any Employee Plan by applicable law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and all material premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any Employee Plan, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid, have been fully reflected on the CompanyÂ’s financial statements.

Except as contemplated by Sections 2.10 and 5.9, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof has taken any actions or used any discretion to accelerate the vesting or payment of any compensation or benefit under any Employee Plan or any award agreement made thereunder in connection with, or as a result of, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Board Appointment Date, if the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with and based upon the advice of outside legal counsel that it is required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties (after taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by Parent pursuant to this Section 5.3(c)), the Company Board may withdraw the Company Recommendation or approve or recommend a Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.3, but in each case only (i) after the fifth business day following ParentÂ’s receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the person making such Superior Proposal and contemporaneously furnishing a copy of the relevant Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the terms or conditions of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written notice by the Company and a new five business day period) and (ii) causing its legal and financial advisors to negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) during such five business day period (or any additional five business day period) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company Board to proceed with the Company Recommendation and not withdraw the Company Recommendation or terminate this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , the Company shall not be entitled to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement or resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such action unless this Agreement is contemporaneously terminated by its terms pursuant to Section 7.1 and the Company has paid all amounts due to Acquisition pursuant to Section 7.3. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Board Appointment Time, the Company (and Company Directors) shall be permitted to (i) comply with applicable law (including Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) with regards to a proposal for a Third Party Acquisition or make any other disclosure to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with and based upon the advice of outside legal counsel, failure to make such a disclosure would be inconsistent with applicable law; _provided,_   _however_ , that neither the Company nor the Company Board shall be permitted to recommend a Third Party Acquisition which is not a Superior Proposal.

   ##### 

  

 

investigation based on or arising out of the fact that such person is or was
an officer or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries whether or
not pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time and whether or not asserted or claimed prior to or at or after
the Effective Time (" _Indemnified Liabilities_ ") and (ii) all
Indemnified Liabilities based on or arising out of or pertaining to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the
fullest extent required or permitted under applicable law, under the Ultimate
Surviving CompanyÂ’s limited liability company agreement (it being agreed
that the provisions thereof relating to indemnification and exoneration from
liability shall, with respect to matters occurring through the Effective
Time, be at least as favorable to the Indemnified Persons as the current
provisions of the CompanyÂ’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws for a
period of six years after the Effective Time) and under any indemnification
agreement to which an Indemnified Person and the Company is a party. Each
Indemnified Person is intended to be a third party beneficiary of this
Section 5.7 and may specifically enforce its terms. This Section 5.7 shall
not limit or otherwise adversely affect any rights any Indemnified Person may
have under any agreement with the Company or under the CompanyÂ’s Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws. 

   

 (b) For six years after the Effective Time, the Ultimate Surviving Company shall provide directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such Indemnified Person covered as of the date hereof by the CompanyÂ’s directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (the " _D andO Policy_"); _provided_ , that if the aggregate annual premiums for such insurance at any time during such period shall exceed 200% of the per annum rate of premium paid by the Company as of the date hereof for such insurance, then the Parent shall only be obligated to cause the Ultimate Surviving Company to provide only such coverage as shall then be available at an annual premium equal to 200% of such current rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parent may cause the Ultimate Surviving Company to purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on terms and conditions no more favorable and no less advantageous than the DandO Policy. In the event that the Company purchases such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Ultimate Surviving Company to maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of the Ultimate Surviving Company under the first sentence of this Section 5.7(b) for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and effect. 

  

 (c) In the event the Ultimate Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into another person and is not the surviving person in such merger or consolidation or transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to another person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Ultimate Parent Company, or at ParentÂ’s option, Parent, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7(b).

 SECTION 5.9. _Employee Matters_.

 (b) Provided that the Effective Time occurs prior to December 31, 2008, following the Effective Time through December 31, 2008, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to current employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (the " _Company Employees_ ") compensation and employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided to Company Employees immediately before the Effective Time, including those described in Section 5.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The foregoing shall not be construed to prevent (i) the amendment or termination of any particular Employee Plan or Employment Agreement to the extent permitted by, and in accordance with, its terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, or (ii) the termination of employment or the reduction of, or other change in, the compensation or employee benefits of any individual Company Employee. 

  

 (c) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the " _Parent Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with all years of service for which such Company Employee was credited before the Effective Time under any similar Employee Plans, except (i) for purposes of accrual under any defined benefit pension plan, (ii) to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits or (iii) to the extent that any Parent Plan does not recognize service of similarly situated employees of Parent and its subsidiaries. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Parent Plans to the extent coverage under such Parent Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Employee Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for purposes of each Parent Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Parent Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such limitation was not applicable immediately before the Effective Time under the analogous Old Plan, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employeeÂ’s participation in the corresponding Parent Plan begins to be taken into account under such Parent Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Parent Plan. 

   #####

 (e) Except as contemplated by Section 2.10 hereof, or this Section 5.9, from and after the date hereof, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall take any actions or use any discretion to accelerate the vesting or payment of any compensation or benefit under any Employee Plan or any award agreement made thereunder in connection with, or as a result of, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 3.6 of the LTCIP, pursuant to Section VIII.(c) of the CompanyÂ’s 1997 Stock Option Plan as restated, effective as of May 12, 2004 and Section 11(a) of the CompanyÂ’s 2006 Stock Awards Plan, effective as of May 10, 2006. 

  

 (f) Nothing in this Section 5.9 shall be construed to limit the right of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the Company and its subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Employee Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this Section 5.9 be construed to require the Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the Company and its subsidiaries) to retain the employment of any particular Company Employee for any fixed period of time following the Closing Date. 

  

 (g) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.6, the provisions of this Section 5.9 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and, except to the extent provided in Section 5.7, no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Employee Plan or other employee benefit plan for any purpose. 

  

 (h) Parent and Acquisition acknowledge that the consummation of the Offer will constitute a Change in Control under the Company Stock Plans and under the employment and individual award agreements that are set forth on Section 5.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (i) If the Company or any of its subsidiaries enters into, adopts, amends, modifies or terminates any Arrangements to Covered Securityholders, the Company intends that all such amounts payable under such Arrangements (i) shall be paid or granted as compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed, or future services to be refrained from performing, by the Covered Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto) and (ii) shall not be calculated based on the number of shares tendered or to be tendered into the Offer by the applicable Covered Securityholder. If there has been any adoption, approval, amendment or modification of any Arrangement, either prior to or after the date of this Agreement, the Company agrees that, upon the request of Parent, the compensation committee of the Company Board, consisting solely of independent directors, shall approve resolutions approving such adoption, approval, amendment or modification as an employment compensation, severance or 

   ##### 

  

 

other employee benefit arrangements, in accordance with the requirements of
Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto. 

   

 (j) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in entering into employment agreements with employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. 

  

 SECTION 5.10. _Advice of Changes; Filings_. The Company and Parent shall promptly advise the other party orally and in writing if (i) any representation or warranty made by it (and, in the case of Parent, made by Acquisition) contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate in a manner that would or would be reasonably likely to result in the failure of the condition set forth in Annex A or (ii) it (and, in the case of Parent, Acquisition) fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it (and, in the case of Parent, Acquisition) under this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by law, promptly provide the other with copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than the portions of such filings that include confidential or proprietary information not directly related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has heretofore made available or promptly will make available to Acquisition or Parent a complete and correct copy of any amendments or modifications which are required to be filed with the SEC but have not yet been filed with the SEC to agreements, documents or other instruments which previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. 

   

 SECTION 5.11. _Restriction on Transfer_. Parent agrees that it will not, and that it will obligate any person to whom Parent transfers any of the Assets or Additional Assets as defined by the Purchase and Sale Agreement between W-H Energy Services, Inc., Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., and Halliburton Company executed January 22, 1999 (" _Assets or Additional Assets_ ") not to transfer by any means any of the Assets or Additional Assets Parent acquires from the Company to Schlumberger Limited or Baker Hughes Incorporated or any of their affiliates during the time period specified in Section XII of the Final Judgment issued on April 1, 1999 in _U.S. v. Halliburton Company and Dresser Industries, Inc.,_ Civil Action Number 98CV02340 (D.C.D.C. September 29, 1998).

 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer (subject to compliance with Section 1.1(a) of the Agreement and any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act), Acquisition shall not be required to accept for payment or pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of, any Shares, if (i) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated or any other requisite clearances and/or approvals under the Antitrust Laws of any Governmental Entity shall not have been obtained prior to the expiration of the Offer, (ii) the S-4 shall not have become effective under the Securities Act or shall be the subject of any stop order or proceeding seeking a stop order, (iii) the Minimum Condition is not satisfied or (iv) at any time on or after the date hereof and prior to the acceptance for payment of Shares, any of the following conditions shall have occurred and continue to exist:

 (b) a Company Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred or any fact, circumstance, occurrence, event, development or change shall have occurred or shall exist which would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; or 

  

 (c) there shall have occurred and continued to exist (i) any general suspension of trading in, or limitation on prices for, securities on the New York Stock Exchange (excluding any coordinated trading halt triggered solely as a result of a specified decrease in a market index and suspensions or limitations resulting from physical damage to or interference with such exchange not related to market conditions), (ii) the declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United States (whether or not mandatory), or (iii) any material limitation (whether or not mandatory) by any U.S. Governmental Entity on the extension of credit by banks or other financial institutions; or

   ##### 

  

 

expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) the representations
and warranties of the Company contained in Sections 3.2(a-d), 3.3(c), 3.19,
3.20 and 3.21, shall not be true and correct in all material respects (with
respect to the figures cited in the first two sentences of Section 3.2(a),
"in all material respects" shall mean that such figures are accurate, in
the aggregate, to within 25,000 shares) at and as of the scheduled Expiration
Date with the same effect as if made at and as of such date or if such
representations speak as of an earlier date, as of such earlier date, (iii)
the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
Sections 3.10(a) shall not be true and correct in all respects at and as of
the scheduled Expiration Date with the same effect as if made at and as of
such date or if such representations speak as of an earlier date, as of such
earlier date or (iv) the Company shall have failed to comply with
its covenants and agreements contained in the Agreement in all material
respects; or

The failure by Acquisition at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and other circumstances will not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances, and each such right will be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
