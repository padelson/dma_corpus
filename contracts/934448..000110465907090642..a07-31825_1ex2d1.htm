Sellers take exception and the Sellers proposed adjustment. If the Sellers

or do not set forth any exceptions, the Sellers shall be deemed to have
accepted the Closing Adjusted Liabilities Report for the purposes of any

other purposes of this Agreement. If the Buyer does not give the Sellers
notice of its objections to the Sellers Adjusted Liabilities Report within

Report, the Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Adjusted
Liabilities Report as adjusted by the Sellers in the Sellers Adjusted
Liabilities Report for the purposes of any adjustment to the Purchase Price
under _Section 3.3(d)_ and for all other purposes of this Agreement. If the
Buyer gives the Sellers timely notice of its objections to the Sellers
Adjusted Liabilities Report, and if the Buyer and the Sellers are unable,
within 15 calendar days after receipt by the Sellers of the notice from the
Buyer of objections, to resolve the disputed exceptions, such disputed
exceptions will be referred to PricewaterhouseCoopers or another firm of
independent certified public accountants (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_

Accounting Firm shall, within 45 days following its selection, deliver to the

disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm acting under this _Section
3.3(c)_ shall be apportioned between the Sellers and the Buyer based on the

disputed exceptions considered by the Independent Accounting Firm. For

the nature of the claim and indicating the amount (estimated, if necessary)
of any Losses that have been or may be sustained by such Indemnitee. The
Indemnitor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to defend, contest
or otherwise protect the Indemnitee against any such suit, action,
investigation, claim or proceeding at its sole cost and expense. If the
Indemnitor so elects to defend, contest or otherwise protect the Indemnitee
against any such suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding, the
Indemnitee shall (i) make available to the Indemnitor all relevant books and
records in its possession, (ii) cooperate with and assist the Indemnitor to
the extent reasonably possible and (iii) not compromise or settle any such
suit, action investigation, claim or proceeding. The Indemnitee shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to participate at its own expense in
the defense thereof by counsel of the Indemnitees choice. If the Indemnitor
fails to defend, contest or otherwise protect against such suit, action,
investigation, claim or proceeding, the Indemnitee shall have the right to do
so and the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover the entire cost thereof
from the Indemnitor (to the extent constituting indemnifiable Losses under
this _Section 11_ and subject to the provisions of this _Section 11_),
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees, disbursements and
amounts paid as the result of such suit, action, investigation, claim or
proceeding and that constitute indemnifiable Losses under this _Section 11_,
_provided_  that the Indemnitee shall not compromise or settle any such suit,
action, investigation, claim or proceeding without the prior written consent
of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  



        
   

  



  

## SECTION 11.5. _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, absent fraud on the part of any
party, indemnification claims brought in accordance with and subject to this
_Section 11_ shall be the exclusive remedy of any Indemnitee after the
Closing with respect to, arising out of, resulting from, or relating to, the
subject matter of this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 11.6. _Mitigation_. Each Indemnitee shall make
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any claim or liability that such
Indemnitee asserts under this _Section 11_.  In the event that an
Indemnitee shall fail to make such commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any claim or liability, then notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary contained herein, the Indemnitor shall not be required to indemnify
such Indemnitee for that portion of any Loss that could reasonably be
expected to have been avoided if such Indemnitee had made such efforts.

Agreement to the contrary:

expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in _Section 11.1_ and
(ii) to give effect to any tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnitee
resulting from any such Losses; and

  

### 

  

### (b) if the Purchase Price is adjusted downward pursuant to _Section
3.3(b)_ or _3.4_ , no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _Section 11_ in respect of the state of facts giving rise
to such Purchase Price adjustment.

  

### 

  

# SECTION 12. _EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE PLANS_.

  

# 

  

## SECTION 12.1. _Offer of Employment_. The Buyer shall offer employment to
those individuals listed on _Schedule 12.1_ and any replacements for
such employees, and who are employees of the Business on the Closing Date ("
_Employees_ "), which offers shall be for comparable positions and at the
same level of base wages and/or salary as provided by the Sellers to such
Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. The Sellers shall be
responsible for the termination of all Employees, including any Employees who
the Sellers do not wish to transfer to alternative employment with any Seller
or an Affiliate of any Seller, and shall pay to such Employees their accrued
severance, vacation and termination benefits, if any, in the manner and to
the extent provided under the terms of such benefit programs. Upon the Closing
Date, the Employees who accept the Buyers offer of employment pursuant to
this _Section 12.1_ shall be "at will" employees of the Buyer and shall be
considered " _Transferred Employees_ " under this Agreement; provided,
however, the Employees on a disability leave of absence as of the Closing
Date (the " _Leave Employees_ ") shall remain employed by and shall be the
responsibility of the Sellers or an Affiliate of the Sellers until they
return to active employment, at which point they will become Transferred
Employees if they begin work with the Buyer. The Sellers agree to provide the
Buyer with such information reasonably requested by the Buyer to assist it
with making the offers of employment pursuant to this _Section 12.1_.

  



        
   

  



  

## SECTION 12.2. _Defined Contribution Plans_. Effective as of the Closing
Date, the Transferred Employees shall be considered terminated participants
in accordance with the terms of the tax-qualified defined contribution plans
listed on _Schedule 12.2_ (the " _Defined Contribution Plans_ "). The
Transferred Employees shall be 100% vested in their individual account
balances under the Defined Contribution Plans as of the Closing Date. As soon
as administratively practicable following the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall advise the Transferred Employees who participate in the Defined
Contribution Plans of their right to elect to receive a distribution of their
individual account balances from such Plans. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, the Sellers and the Buyer agree that such amounts so
distributed may be transferred by the Transferred Employees to a
defined contribution plan maintained by the Buyer in a direct rollover.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 12.3. _Welfare Plans_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The Sellers shall retain responsibility for and continue to pay all
hospital, medical, life insurance, disability, workmens compensation
expenses and benefits under all welfare benefit plans, as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA, maintained by the Sellers and their Affiliates for each
Transferred Employee (and his or her dependents) with respect to claims
incurred under such welfare benefit plans, but shall have no responsibility
for any Transferred Employee (or his or her dependents) with respect to
claims incurred under the Buyers welfare benefit plans on or after the
Closing Date, except to the extent required by COBRA. For purposes of this
_Section 12.3_, claims shall be deemed to have been incurred:

  

### 

  

#### (i) with respect to all death or dismemberment claims, on the actual
date of death or dismemberment;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) with respect to all disability claims, on the date the claimant
became unable to perform his or her regular duties of employment;

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) with respect to all medical, drug or dental claims, on the date
the serviced was received or the supply was purchased by the claimant; and

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) with respect to workers compensation claims, on the date the
incident giving rise to the claim occurred.

  

#### 

  

### (b) The Buyer agrees that the Transferred Employees will be eligible to
participate in the employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements
sponsored and maintained by the Buyer or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates ("
_Buyer Plans_ "), and such Transferred Employees will receive benefits on
substantially similar terms and conditions as other employees of the Buyer or
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates with similar titles and functions. The Buyer
agrees that the Transferred Employees shall be credited for all service with
the Sellers and their Affiliates for the purposes of determining the amount
of vacation to which the Transferred Employees are entitled under the Buyers
vacation pay plan.

  

### 

  

### (c) The Buyer agrees to provide the Transferred Employees with COBRA
continuation coverage with respect to Transferred Employees (and their
covered dependants) in respect of any "qualifying event" (as defined in
Section 4980B of the Code) occurring on or after Closing. The Sellers shall
offer COBRA continuation coverage under its group health plans to 

  



        
   

  



  

### all other employees of the Business (and their covered dependents)
who experienced or experience a "qualifying event."

  

### 

  

### (d) The Sellers shall retain all liability to the Transferred Employees
for accrued vacation as of the Closing Date.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 12.4. _Rights_.  Nothing herein expressed or implied shall confer
upon any Transferred Employee or other employee or former employee of the
Sellers or legal representatives thereof, any rights or remedies, including,
without limitation, right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever, or any right to specific
terms or conditions of employment (including rate of pay, fringe benefits or
position) under or by reason of this Agreement.
