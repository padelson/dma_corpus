accounting firm or (y) the Company shall have provided notice in writing to
Buyer that it has determined that it is necessary to restate any material
financial information included in the Financing Information or that it is

all the Blocker Interests owned by Blocker Seller (collectively, the
"Purchase"), in exchange for the consideration set forth in this Article II.



Section 2.3Payment of the Purchase Price.



(a)Payment of the Closing Cash Consideration. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall
pay the Closing Cash Consideration as follows:



(i)Pay to each Seller his, her or its pro rata share of the Closing Cash
Consideration (less such Seller's pro rata share of the Adjustment Escrow

Payment Schedule, by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an
account designated in writing by such Seller not less than three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date.



(ii)Deposit $7,000,000.00 (the "Adjustment Escrow Amount") into an escrow
account (the "Escrow Account") to be established and maintained by JP Morgan
Chase Bank, NA (the "Escrow Agent") as of the Closing Date pursuant to an
escrow agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the
"Escrow Agreement"). The Escrow Agreement will be entered into on the Closing
Date by Sellers' Representative, Buyer and the Escrow Agent and the Adjustment
Escrow Amount will serve as security for and a source of all or part (as the
case may be) of payment of the Sellers' obligations pursuant to Section
2.6(d)(ii), if any.



(iii)Repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of the Company, the Closing
Indebtedness described on Schedule 2.3(a)(iii). At least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer the Payoff

instructions indicating the amount required to discharge in full such Closing
Indebtedness as of such estimated Closing Date for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement plus, if applicable, a per diem amount for any
days that the Closing Date occurs after such estimated Closing Date.



(iv)Pay, on behalf of the Company, all Closing Seller Expenses. At least three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Buyer, for each Person owed Seller Expenses, a payoff letter or invoice, in

indicating the amount required to discharge in full the Closing Seller
Expenses owed to that Person as of the mutually agreed estimated Closing Date.
The parties acknowledge that the Closing Seller Expenses are obligations of
the Company and the Sellers, incurred on or before the Closing Date, and
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to make them obligations of Buyer.
Payment of such Closing Seller Expenses by Buyer, on behalf of the Company, on

RDB, the RDB Shareholders agree shall be provided to the RDB Shareholders in
equal one-third amounts), free and clear of all Liens (other than those
arising under securities Laws and pursuant to the Equity Agreements). For the
avoidance of doubt, the issuance of the Closing Stock Consideration to the RDB

(a)Estimated Purchase Price. No later than three Business Days prior to the
Closing, Sellers' Representative will deliver to Buyer (i) a statement (the
"Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth the Sellers' good faith estimates
of the amounts of Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness,
Specified Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities and Closing Seller Expenses, together
with a calculation of the Purchase Price (the "Estimated Purchase Price")
based on such estimates, and (ii) a schedule (the "Payment Schedule") setting
forth (A) each Seller's pro rata share of the Estimated Purchase Price, the
Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Seller Reserve Amount, (B) the amount of the
Closing Cash Consideration due to each Seller and the accounts to which the
Closing Cash Consideration shall be paid by Buyer to each Seller at the
Closing and (C) the amount of the Closing Stock Consideration due to each
Seller, in each case taking into account the purchase price paid by the Buyer
to each Seller for such Seller's respective Company Interests as described on
Schedule 2.6(a). The Estimated Closing Statement and the determinations and
calculations contained therein will be prepared in accordance with this
Agreement, including the Accounting Principles. Prior to the Closing, Buyer
shall have an opportunity to review the Estimated Closing Statement and the
Sellers' Representative shall consider any comments made thereto by the Buyer
in good faith. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and its Affiliates shall have
no liability for any allocation of the Purchase Price among the Sellers as set
forth in the Payment Schedule and each Seller confirms that the Payment
Schedule reflects the agreed upon distribution of the Closing Cash
Consideration among the Sellers regardless of any inconsistencies with the
Company's Governing Documents.



(b)Determination of Final Purchase Price.



(i)As soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than 75 days after the
Closing Date, Buyer will prepare and deliver to Sellers' Representative a
statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth Buyer's good faith
determination of the actual amounts of Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness, Specified Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities and Closing Seller
Expenses, together with a calculation of the Purchase Price based on such
amounts. The Closing Statement and the determinations and calculations
contained therein will be prepared in accordance with this Agreement,
including the Accounting Principles.



(ii)Within 30 days following receipt by Sellers' Representative of the Closing
Statement, Sellers' Representative may deliver a written notice (an "Objection
Notice") to Buyer of any dispute they have with respect to the preparation or
content of the Closing Statement. Any amount, determination or calculation
contained in the Closing Statement and not disputed in a timely delivered
Objection Notice will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties, absent
manifest error. If Sellers' Representative does not deliver an Objection
Notice with respect to the Closing Statement within such 30-day period, or if
Sellers' Representative notifies Buyer in writing prior to the end of such
period that Sellers' Representative waives its right to dispute the Closing
Statement, then the Closing Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on
the Parties, absent manifest error. If an Objection Notice is timely delivered
within such 30-day period, Buyer and Sellers' Representative will negotiate in
good faith to resolve each dispute raised therein (each, an "Objection"). If
Buyer and Sellers' Representative, notwithstanding such good faith efforts,
fail to resolve all Objections within 15 days after Sellers' Representative
delivers an Objection Notice, then Buyer and Sellers' Representative will
jointly engage the dispute resolution group of a nationally 

recognized accounting firm mutually selected by the Parties, acting reasonably
(the "Accounting Firm") to resolve such disputes (acting as an expert and not
an arbitrator) in accordance with this Agreement (including the Accounting
Principles) as soon as practicable thereafter. At or prior to such engagement,
each Party shall submit to the Accounting Firm such Party's computation of the
Purchase Price, based on such Party's position with respect to the matters
that are the subject of the Objections (such Party's "Proposed Resolution").
The objective of the selection of the Accounting Firm is to retain a competent
party with individuals within such organization who have expertise in
resolving disputes of the nature contemplated in this Section 2.6(b) and which
Accounting Firm does not have to the extent possible a material relationship
with Buyer, the Company or Sellers and which individuals do not have
individual conflicts or material or prospective relationships with Buyer, the
Company or Sellers. Buyer and Sellers' Representative will request that the
Accounting Firm deliver a written report containing its calculation of the
disputed Objections as soon as practicable. The Accounting Firm will only
consider those items and amounts set forth in the Closing Statement or that
Buyer or Sellers' Representative believes should be set forth in the Closing
Statement, as the case may be, as to which Buyer and Sellers' Representative
have disagreed within the time periods and on the terms specified above. The
Accounting Firm must resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. The Accounting Firm will make its determination
based on written submissions and/or presentations and supporting material
provided by Buyer and Sellers' Representative and, at its election, pursuant
to responses provided by Buyer and Sellers' Representative to inquiries posed
by the Accounting Firm based on such written submissions and/or presentations
and supporting material but not pursuant to its independent review. The
Purchase Price finally determined by the Accounting Firm will not be greater
than Sellers' Representative's Proposed Resolution or less than Buyer's
Proposed Resolution. All Objections that are resolved between the Parties or
are determined by the Accounting Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on
the Parties, absent manifest error. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm will be apportioned by the Accounting Firm to Sellers' Representative
(from the Seller Reserve Amount), on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, as follows: (x) to Sellers' Representative, a portion of such total
amount of fees and expenses equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is the
excess (if any) of Sellers' Representative's Proposed Resolution over the
Purchase Price finally determined by the Accounting Firm and the denominator
of which is the difference between Sellers' Representative's Proposed
Resolution and Buyer's Proposed Resolution, and (y) to Buyer, the remainder of
such fees and expenses.



(c)Access. Following Buyer's delivery of the Closing Statement, Buyer will,
and will cause the Company to, make its financial records, accounting
personnel and advisors relevant to the Closing Statement or calculations to be
contained therein reasonably available to Sellers' Representative, its
accountants and other representatives and the Accounting Firm at reasonable
times during the review by Sellers' Representative and the Accounting Firm of,
and the resolution of any Objections with respect to, the Closing Statement.



(d)Adjustments.



(i)If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.6(b) (the
"Final Purchase Price") exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, then not later
than the fifth Business Day after the date on which the Final Purchase Price
is finally determined, (A) Buyer and Sellers' Representative will deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse to Sellers' Representative all of the Adjustment Escrow Amount (which
such amount Sellers' Representative will pay to the Sellers in accordance with
the Payment Schedule), 

and (B) Buyer will pay to Sellers' Representative such excess (which such
amount Sellers' Representative will pay to the Sellers in accordance with the
Payment Schedule) by wire transfer of immediately available funds.



(ii)If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price (the
"Shortfall Amount"), then not later than the fifth Business Day after the date
on which the Final Purchase Price is finally determined, Buyer and Sellers'
Representative will deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to (A) if the Shortfall Amount is greater than or
equal to the Adjustment Escrow Amount, disburse to Buyer all of the Adjustment
Escrow Amount, and (B) if the Shortfall Amount is less than the Adjustment
Escrow Amount, disburse to Buyer a portion of the Adjustment Escrow Amount
equal to the Shortfall Amount and disburse to Sellers' Representative the
remaining portion of the Adjustment Escrow Amount (which such amount Sellers'
Representative will pay to the Sellers in accordance with the Payment
Schedule).

(iii)If the Final Purchase Price equals the Estimated Purchase Price, then not
later than the fifth Business Day after the date on which the Final Purchase
Price is determined Buyer and Sellers' Representative will deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse to the Sellers' Representative all of the Adjustment Escrow Amount
(which such amount Sellers' Representative will pay to Sellers in accordance
with the Payment Schedule).



(e)Accounting Principles. The Estimated Closing Statement, the Closing
Statement and the determinations and calculations contained therein will be
prepared and calculated on a consolidated basis for the Company in accordance
with the same accounting principles, practices, procedures, policies and
methods (with consistent classifications, judgments, inclusions, exclusions
and valuation and estimation methodologies) used and applied by the Company in
the preparation of the balance sheet contained in the Audited Financial
Statements, except that such statements, calculations and determinations: (i)
will not include any purchase accounting or other adjustment arising out of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) will follow
GAAP as modified by the defined terms and methodologies contained in this
Agreement (including, without limitation, Exhibit D) whether or not such terms
or methodologies are consistent with GAAP and (iv) will calculate any
reserves, accruals or other non-cash expense items on a pro rata (as opposed
to monthly accrual) basis to account for a Closing that occurs on any date
other than the last day of a calendar month (collectively, the "Accounting
Principles").



(f)Escrow Account. The Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be the sole recourse for
Buyer and shall be used solely to satisfy any amounts owed to Buyer pursuant
to Section 2.6(d)(ii), if any. Upon the final release of all of the Adjustment
Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 2.6(d), the Escrow Agreement shall
terminate. Any fees owed to the Escrow Agent shall be borne by Buyer and the
indemnification obligations under the Escrow Agreement shall be borne 50% by
Buyer and 50% by the Sellers. The Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be held in
trust for the benefit of Buyer and the Sellers and shall be held and disbursed
solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement. In the event that the shortfall described in Section
2.6(d)(ii) is greater than the Adjustment Escrow Amount, Buyer shall have no
recourse against any of the Sellers or any other Person for such difference.



Section 2.7Purchase Price Allocation

. 

(a)Tax Characterization. For U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and applicable
state and local income Tax purposes), except as required by Law, the Parties
will treat the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a purchase by
Buyer and a sale by the Sellers of shares of corporate stock (with respect to
the Blocker Interests) and interests in a partnership (with respect to the
Purchased Interests other than the Blocker Interests), and the parties will
not take any position inconsistent therewith, except as otherwise required by
Law.



(b)Allocation. The Sellers and Buyer shall allocate (i) the Purchase Price
among the shares of corporate stock of the Blocker, and (ii) the portion of
the purchase price (for Tax purposes) allocable to the Purchased Interests
other than the Blocker Interests (including any liabilities assumed or taken
subject to and treated as consideration for federal income Tax purposes) among
the assets of the Company and, to the extent applicable, the Subsidiaries in
accordance with Section 751 and Section 755 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder. Sellers and Buyer agree that the fair market value of
the assets of the Company will be determined using the "residual method" for
purposes of Section 1060 of the Code and Section 1.338-6(b) of the Treasury
Regulations; provided, however, that the parties need not agree on the fair
market value of the assets of the Company and shall each be entitled to take
any reasonable position with respect thereto, except for any covenants not to
compete within the meaning of Section 197 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder, the fair market value of which shall be determined by
Buyer in its reasonable discretion, provided that such value shall not exceed
$5,000,000. Within one-hundred and twenty (120) days of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers' Representative a written statement of its
determination of the portion of the purchase price allocable to any covenants
not to compete and Buyer and Sellers agree to file all income Tax Returns and
prepare all financial statements consistently with such determination.



Section 2.8 Withholding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Acquired Companies, the Escrow Agent, and Buyer shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable to any
Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payments under any Tax Laws.
The withheld amounts shall be paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority
and treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. No later
than five (5) Business Days before Closing, Buyer shall notify the Sellers if
it believes any such withholding will be required other than withholding for
payroll Taxes with respect to compensatory payments in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Buyer and the Sellers shall
cooperate in good faith to reduce the amount of, or eliminate the necessity
for, such withholding.

(a)Parent has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
all registration statements, proxy statements and other statements, reports,
schedules, forms and other documents (including all exhibits and all other
information incorporated by reference) required to be filed by it with the SEC
(the "Parent SEC Documents"), and all amendments thereto. To Buyer's
Knowledge, none of the Parent SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC
review and there are no inquiries or investigations by the SEC or any internal
investigations pending or threatened, in each case regarding any accounting
practices of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. All required statements,
reports, schedules, forms and other documents 

required to have been filed by Parent with the SEC have been so filed. None of
Parent's Subsidiaries is required to file any documents with the SEC. As of
the time it was filed with the SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) (i) each
of the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, as it may be amended from time to time and (ii) none of the Parent SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.



(b)Except as set forth in Parent SEC Documents, none of Parent and its
Subsidiaries is a party to any Contract, a copy of which would be required to
be filed with the SEC as an exhibit to an annual report on Form 10-K
(collectively, "Parent Material Contracts"). Each Parent Material Contract
(assuming due power and authority of, and due execution and delivery by, the
other party or parties thereto) is valid and binding on Parent or its
Subsidiaries that is a party thereto, as applicable, and is in full force and
effect, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy Laws, other
similar Laws affecting creditors' rights and general principles of equity
affecting the availability of specific performance and other equitable
remedies. Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Documents, (i) as of the date
of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has violated or
breached, or committed any default under, any Parent Material Contract; (ii)
to the Knowledge of Buyer, as of the date of this Agreement, no other Person
has violated or breached, or committed any material default under, any Parent
Material Contract; and (iii) as of the date of this Agreement no event has
occurred and is continuing through actions or inactions of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries that will result in a violation or breach, in any material
respect, of any of the provisions of any Parent Material Contract.



(c)The common stock of Parent is listed on the New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE"). Parent is in material compliance with the listing standards of the
NYSE. To Buyer's Knowledge, there are no inquiries or investigations by the
NYSE pending or threatened, in each case regarding the Buyer's compliance with
the NYSE listing standards that may reasonably result in suspension of trading
or delisting of the Parent's common stock from the NYSE.



Section 5.12Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties. NOTWITHSTANDING THE
DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO SELLERS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION
(INCLUDING ANY FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS OR OTHER SUPPLEMENTAL DATA), EXCEPT AS

THAT SUCH WILL BE "AS IS, WHERE IS" ON THE CLOSING DATE, AND IN THEIR PRESENT
CONDITION, AND SELLERS WILL RELY ON THEIR OWN EXAMINATION AND INVESTIGATION
THEREOF AS WELL AS THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER OR PARENT SET
FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE V, AND AS QUALIFIED BY THE SCHEDULES, IN EACH CASE.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, NOTHING HEREIN
SHALL WAIVE OR RESTRICT ANY CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION, AWARD OR 

REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY VIOLATION OF SEC RULE 10B-5 OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE
SECURITIES LAW BY BUYER OR PARENT.



ARTICLE VI

COVENANTS



Section 6.1Conduct of Business of the Company.



(a)Except as contemplated by this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Restructuring), from and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, the Sellers will cause the Company to, except as set forth on
Schedule 6.1 or as consented to in writing by Buyer (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), or required in order to
comply with any law or Contract, (i) conduct the Company's business in the
ordinary course, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and
preserve intact the current organization, businesses and franchises of the
Company and to preserve the rights, franchises, goodwill and relationships of
its employees, customers, lenders, suppliers, regulators and others having
business relationships with the Company.



(b)Except for the enforcement of the terms of this Agreement, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall otherwise be construed to give Buyer,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's
operations prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall
exercise, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over the Company's operations. Further, prior to the
Closing, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the
Company from declaring and paying any dividends or distributions of cash and
cash equivalents of the Company or from repaying any Indebtedness.



Section 6.2Public Announcements. The Parties shall consult with one another
before issuing any press release, or otherwise making any public statements,
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no Party
shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
obtaining each other Party's written approval (with respect to the Sellers,
such approval to be obtained by the Sellers' Representative), which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided, that
each Party may make any such announcement which it in good faith believes,
based on advice of counsel, is necessary or advisable in connection with any
requirement of Law, regulation or the rules of any applicable stock exchange,
it being understood and agreed that each Party will provide the other Party
with copies of any such announcement in advance of such issuance, to the
extent practicable under the circumstances and shall consider in good faith
any comments thereto made by the other Party.



Section 6.3Access to Information. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, upon reasonable notice, and subject to restrictions
contained in the confidentiality agreements to which any Seller or the Company
may be subject, the Sellers will cause the Company to provide to Buyer and its
authorized Representatives during normal business hours reasonable access to
all books and records, properties, assets, and real property of the Company
(in a manner so as to not interfere with the normal business operations of the
Company); provided, however, that any such access shall be conducted at
Buyer's sole expense under the supervision of the Company's personnel. All of
such information will be treated as confidential information pursuant to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. All requests for such access shall be
directed to Don Clark and such additional Persons designated by the Company in
writing to Buyer (collectively, the "Designated Contacts"). Other than the
Designated Contacts, or otherwise in the ordinary 

course of business unrelated to the transactions contemplated hereby or
Buyer's acquisition of the Company, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates or
any of their respective representatives shall contact any employee, customer,
supplier, landlord, lender or other material business relation of the Company
without the prior written consent of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to disclose
any information to Buyer or its Representatives regarding the Company's entry
into or conducting of a sale process prior to the execution of this Agreement
or other information, if such disclosure would, in the reasonable discretion
of Sellers' Representative, (a) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal
privilege or (b) contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date hereof. Buyer acknowledges that the
information being provided to it in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement,
the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.



Section 6.4Documents and Information. After the Closing Date, Buyer will, and
will cause the Company to, until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, retain all books, records and other documents pertaining to the business
of the Company in existence on the Closing Date and make the same available
for inspection and copying by any Seller (at such Seller's expense) during
normal business hours of the Company upon reasonable request and upon
reasonable notice. Buyer shall not be obligated to provide any Seller with
access to any books or records (including personnel files) pursuant to this
Section 6.4 where such access would violate any Law or jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege. As a condition to making any such
information available to Sellers, such Seller shall enter into such
confidentiality or other nondisclosure arrangements as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer to protect the disclosure of such information. No such
books, records or documents that may be relevant to any legal, regulatory or
Tax audit, investigation, inquiry, or requirement will be destroyed after the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date by Buyer or the Company without
first advising the Sellers in writing and giving the Sellers a reasonable
opportunity to obtain possession thereof.



Section 6.5Necessary Consents. From the date hereof until the Closing, the
Sellers shall, or shall cause the Company to, use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain prior to the Closing such consents
of third parties and to give notices to third parties to avoid the breach or
termination of any Contract that is listed on Schedule 3.7(a) to which the
Company is a party. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, none of the
Sellers or the Company shall be required to pay, or commit to pay, any money
or other consideration or incur any liability or other obligation as part of
their efforts to obtain such consents, and the failure to obtain any such
consent shall not result in the failure of any of the conditions to the
Closing set forth in Article VII.



Section 6.6Governmental Approvals.



(a)Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each Party will use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do,
or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the satisfaction, but not waiver, of
the closing conditions set forth in Article VII hereof). Each Party will use
reasonable best efforts to obtain consents of all Governmental Entities
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including
obtaining all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions
contemplated hereby under the HSR Act and other applicable Laws (including
under any applicable foreign Law relating to antitrust, competition or merger
matters ("Foreign Competition Laws")). All costs incurred by a Party in
connection with obtaining such consents shall be paid by such Party, except
that Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of all of the filing fees
payable in connection with the filing of the applicable Notification and
Report Forms under the 

HSR Act pursuant to this Section 6.6(a) and in connection with filings under
the Foreign Competition Laws. Each Party will make, as promptly as practicable
(and in any event, within three (3) Business Days following the date hereof),
an appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and will supply as promptly as practicable to
the appropriate Governmental Entities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and the
Foreign Competition Laws, and to take all other actions necessary, proper or
advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act, including by requesting early termination of the
waiting period provided for in the HSR Act.



(b)In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of Section 6.6(a),
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly take any and all
steps necessary to avoid, eliminate or resolve each and every impediment and
obtain all clearances, consents, approvals and waivers under the HSR Act and
the Foreign Competition Laws that may be required by any Governmental Entity,
in each case, with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the Parties to
close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable, including (i) proposing, negotiating, offering to commit and
effect (and if such offer is accepted, committing to and effecting), by Order,
consent decree, hold separate order, trust, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, license, disposition or hold separate of such assets or
businesses of Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, or otherwise offering to take or offering to commit to take any
action (including any action that limits its freedom of action, ownership or
control with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, any of the
businesses, assets, product lines, properties or services of Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates) to the extent
legally permissible, and if the offer is accepted, taking or committing to
take such action; (ii) terminating, relinquishing, modifying or waiving
existing relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other
arrangements of Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates; (iii) creating any relationships, ventures, contractual rights,
obligations or other arrangements of Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates; and (iv) entering or offering to enter
into agreements and stipulating to the entry of an Order or filing appropriate
applications with any Governmental Entity in connection with any of the
actions contemplated by the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) (provided,
that the Company shall be obligated to take any such action unless the taking
of such action is expressly conditioned upon the Closing and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby), in each case, as may be necessary,
required or advisable in order to obtain clearance under the HSR Act and the
Foreign Competition Laws, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of or to vacate or lift, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that would otherwise have the effect of restraining, preventing or
delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or to avoid
the commencement of any Action that seeks to prohibit the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that any Governmental Entity
requires the divestiture or the holding separate by Buyer, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or of any assets or businesses
thereof, no adjustment shall be made to the Purchase Price and Buyer shall be
required to divest such assets and businesses, or hold them separate, as the
case may be, following the Closing.



(c)In the event any Action by or before any Governmental Entity or other
Person is commenced which questions the validity or legality of the
transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages in connection therewith, the
Parties agree to cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to defend against
such Action. Each of the Parties shall promptly notify the other Parties of
any material communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement and permit the other Parties to review in advance any proposed
material communication by such Party to any Governmental Entity, but, for the
avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions between such Party and such
Governmental Entity in the ordinary course of business (unrelated to the 

transactions contemplated hereby) and any disclosure which is not permitted by
applicable Law. No Party to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any
meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation
or other inquiry unless it consults with the other Parties in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity and by applicable Law, gives
the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting.
Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Parties will coordinate and
cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other Parties may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting
periods including under the HSR Act. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Parties will provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings
or communications between them or any of their Representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of its staff, on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, but,
for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions between such Party
and such Governmental Entity in the ordinary course of business (unrelated to
the transactions contemplated hereby) and any disclosure which is not
permitted by applicable Law.



Section 6.7Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.



(a)For a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, Buyer shall not
(and shall cause the Acquired Companies not to) amend, repeal or modify the
indemnification and liability limitation or exculpation provisions of the
Acquired Companies' Governing Documents in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any individual who, as of the Closing Date or
at any time prior to the Closing Date, is or was a manager, director, officer,
employee or agent of any Acquired Company, unless such modification is
required by applicable Law. Subject to the preceding sentence, Buyer agrees
(i) that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor of
the current or former managers, directors, officers, employees and agents of
any Acquired Company (each, an "Indemnitee"), as provided in such Acquired
Company's Governing Documents with respect to any matters occurring on or
prior to the Closing Date, will survive the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and will continue in full force and effect, (ii) that it will cause
the Acquired Companies to perform and discharge their respective obligations
to provide such indemnity and exculpation, (iii) to the fullest extent
provided for in such Governing Documents, such indemnification will be
mandatory rather than permissive, and, (iv) after the Closing, Buyer will
cause the Acquired Companies to advance expenses in connection with such
indemnification to the fullest extent provided in such Acquired Company's
Governing Documents.



(b)Contemporaneously with the Closing, the Company will, and Buyer will cause
the Company to, purchase and maintain in effect, without any lapses in
coverage, a "tail" policy providing directors' and officers', employment
practices liability and fiduciary liability insurance coverage for the benefit
of those Persons who are covered by the Company's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies as of the date of this Agreement or at the
Closing, for a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date with respect
to matters occurring prior to the Closing that is at least equal to the
coverage provided under the Company's current directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies. The premium for such "tail" policy shall be paid
by Buyer when due and shall not constitute a Seller Expense hereunder.



(c)Buyer hereby acknowledges that the Indemnitees may have certain rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by the
Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Company and Subsidiaries)
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnitors"). Buyer hereby agrees that from and
after the Closing Date (i) the Company, the Subsidiaries and any of their
successors or assigns are the indemnitors of first resort (i.e., its
obligations to Indemnitees are primary and any obligation of the Seller
Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same
expenses or liabilities incurred 

by any Indemnitee are secondary), (ii) the Company, the Subsidiaries and any
of their successors or assigns shall be required to advance the full amount of
expenses incurred by any Indemnitee and shall be liable for the full amount of
all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to
the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of this Agreement
and the Governing Documents of the Company or any Subsidiary (or any other
agreement between the Company or any Subsidiary and any Indemnitee), without
regard to any rights an Indemnitee may have against the Seller Indemnitors and
(iii) it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Seller Indemnitors
from any and all claims against the Seller Indemnitors for contribution,
subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. Buyer
further agrees that no advancement or payment by the Seller Indemnitors on
behalf of an Indemnitee with respect to any claim for which an Indemnitee has
sought indemnification from the Company shall affect the foregoing and the
Seller Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to
the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of
an Indemnitee against the Company. Buyer agrees that the Seller Indemnitors
are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this Section 6.7(c).



(d)Buyer covenants, for itself and its successors and assigns, that it and
they shall not institute any Action in any court or before any administrative
agency or before any other tribunal against any of the current directors or
managers of any Acquired Company, in their capacity as such, with respect to
any liabilities, actions or causes of action, judgments, claims or demands of
any nature or description (consequential, compensatory, punitive or
otherwise), in each such case to the extent resulting from their approval of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.



(e)The present and former (each determined as of the Closing Date) directors,
managers, officers, employees and agents of each Acquired Company entitled to
the indemnification, liability limitation, exculpation and insurance set forth
in this Section 6.7 are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 6.7, and no such Person shall be obligated to seek contribution from
any other Person who may have an obligation to indemnify such Person for any
matter with respect to which such covered Person is entitled to
indemnification from any Acquired Company by virtue of this Section 6.7. The
obligations of Buyer and the Company under this Section 6.7 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any director,
manager, officer, employee or agent to whom this Section 6.7 applies without
the consent of such affected director, manager, officer, employee or agent.
This Section 6.7 will survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and will be binding on all successors and assigns of
Buyer.



Section 6.8Employee Benefit Matters. During the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date or,
if earlier, until the applicable employee ceases to be employed by the Company
immediately following the Closing, Buyer will cause the Company to provide
employees of the Company actively employed by the Company as of the Closing
and who continue to be employed by the Company with (a) substantially similar
base wages or base salary, as applicable, and cash bonus opportunities as were
provided to such employees immediately prior to the Closing Date and (b)
employee benefits (other than equity-based arrangements, defined benefit
pension plans, or retiree welfare benefits, or retention or change in control
compensation or benefits, including, without limitation, the Stock Tracking
Unit Agreements) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the
employee benefits that were provided to such employees immediately prior to
the Closing Date. Buyer further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date,
Buyer will cause the Company to grant all of its employees credit for any
service with the Company earned prior to the Closing Date (i) for eligibility
to participate and vesting purposes (but not for purposes of benefit accruals
under a defined benefit plan or vesting pursuant to equity incentive plans)
and (ii) for purposes of vacation accrual and severance benefit determinations
under any 

benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement that may be
established or maintained by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, including the
Company on or after the Closing Date (the "New Plans"). In addition, to the
extent that Buyer or its Affiliates modifies any coverage or benefit plans
covering employees of the Company that provide benefits similar to an Employee
Benefit Plan during the plan year that includes the Closing, Buyer will (A)
cause to be waived all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence
of insurability requirements under any New Plan to the extent waived or
satisfied by an employee under the similar Employee Benefit Plan as of the
Closing Date and (B) cause, with respect to any New Plan that is a group
health plan, any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses
paid on or for that portion of the group health plan year before the Closing
Date by any employee (or covered dependent thereof) of the Company to be taken
into account for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing Date under
any such New Plan in the year of initial participation (without duplication
for the same period of coverage), except to the extent the consent of a third
party, such as an insurer, is required and such consent cannot be obtained
through commercially reasonable efforts. Nothing contained herein, express or
implied, (x) is intended to confer upon any employee of the Company any right
to continued employment for any period or continued receipt of any specific
employee benefit, or will constitute an amendment to or any other modification
of any New Plan or Employee Benefit Plan, (y) shall, subject to compliance
with the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.8, alter or limit Buyer's or
the Company's ability to amend, modify or terminate any particular benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (z) is intended to confer upon any
individual (including employees, retirees, or dependents or beneficiaries of
employees or retirees) any right as a third party beneficiary of this
Agreement.



Section 6.9Sellers' Representative.



(a)Each Seller hereby irrevocably appoints Sellers' Representative as the sole
representative of the Sellers to act as the agent and on behalf of such
Sellers regarding any matter relating to or under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents (collectively, the "SR
Agreements"), and Sellers' Representative shall have full power and authority
on each Seller's behalf concerning, without limitation, (i) making decisions
with respect to the determination of Final Purchase Price, Closing Working
Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Seller Expenses and other
matters under Section 2.6(d); (ii) determining whether the conditions to
closing in Article VII have been satisfied and supervising the Closing,
including waiving any condition, as determined by Sellers' Representative, in
its sole discretion; (iii) taking any action that may be necessary or
desirable, as determined by Sellers' Representative, in its sole discretion,
in connection with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article VIII or any other SR Agreement; (iv) taking any and all actions that
may be necessary or desirable, as determined by Sellers' Representative, in
its sole discretion, in connection with the amendment of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 10.2 or any other SR Agreement; (v) accepting notices
on behalf of the Sellers in accordance with Section 10.5 or any other SR
Agreement; (vi) executing and delivering, on behalf of the Sellers, any and
all notices, documents or certificates to be executed by the Sellers, in
connection with the SR Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby;
and (vii) granting any consent, waiver or approval on behalf of the Sellers
under the SR Agreements. As the representative of the Sellers under the SR
Agreements, Sellers' Representative shall act as the agent for all Sellers,
shall have authority to bind each such Person in accordance with the SR
Agreements, and Buyer may conclusively rely on such appointment and authority
in all respects. Buyer may conclusively rely upon, without independent
verification or investigation, all decisions made by Sellers' Representative
in connection with the SR Agreements in writing and signed by an authorized
person of Sellers' Representative. All decisions and 

actions by Sellers' Representative (to the extent authorized by this
Agreement) shall be binding upon all Sellers, and no Seller shall have the
right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.



(b)Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that Sellers' Representative shall
retain the Seller Reserve Amount for the purpose of paying any fees, costs and
expenses incurred by Sellers' Representative in connection with the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement and each of the documents
to be executed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Each
Seller further acknowledges and agrees that Sellers' Representative shall have
the right, but not the obligation, exercisable in its sole discretion, to
distribute to any Seller at any time such Seller's pro rata portion of the
Seller Reserve Amount upon the delivery by such Seller to Sellers'
Representative (in favor of Sellers' Representative on behalf of such Seller)
of (i) a letter of credit or (ii) a written undertaking, in either case, in
support of such Seller's obligations hereunder and with such form and
substance acceptable to Sellers' Representative, in its sole discretion.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Sellers acknowledges and agrees
that there can be no assurances that any of the Seller Reserve Amount will be
paid or disbursed to the Sellers.



(c)Sellers' Representative shall be entitled to retain counsel and to incur
such fees, costs and expenses as Sellers' Representative deems to be necessary
or appropriate in connection with the performance of its obligations under
this Agreement and each of the documents to be executed in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Sellers' Representative shall be reimbursed
for all such fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees,
costs and expenses) first from the Seller Reserve Amount and, to the extent
that such fees, costs and expenses exceed such amount, then on a pro rata
basis from the Sellers. Each Seller agrees to indemnify Sellers'
Representative and its partners, members, officers, directors, employees,
agents and other representatives for its respective pro rata share of any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of any

made in this Agreement or (c) increase any liability of Buyer or any Acquired
Company as compared to the transactions set forth in the preceding sentence
(including, without limitation, any liability for Taxes). The Sellers shall
notify Buyer promptly of any changes to the Restructuring reasonably in
advance of effecting any modified step of the Restructuring and shall consider

Section 6.11Obligations in Respect of Debt Financing.



(a)Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best

with, the Marketing Efforts (insofar as they relate to the Company) related to
the Debt Financing; (ii) participation by senior management of the Company in,
and assistance with, the preparation of a reasonable number of rating agency

requested by Buyer to facilitate the satisfaction on a timely basis of the
conditions precedent to obtaining the Debt Financing set forth in paragraphs
(1), (8) and (10) of Exhibit D to the Debt Commitment Letter (insofar as such
conditions relate to the Company); (v) requesting from the Company's existing
lenders customary payoff letters, lien terminations or other instruments of
termination or discharge in respect of Indebtedness of the Company
contemplated by this Agreement to be repaid at Closing; and (vi) in the case
of managers of the Company that will continue to be managers of the Company
following the Closing, taking customary actions in such capacity (subject to
applicable fiduciary duties) to approve the Debt Financing. The Company
further agrees to supplement reasonably promptly the information provided by
the Company pursuant to this Section 6.11 to the extent that such information,
to the Knowledge of the Company, contains any material misstatement of fact or
omits to state any material fact necessary to make such information not
misleading in any material respect. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary: (A) such requested cooperation
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or the ongoing operations
of the Company or any of its Affiliates; (B) nothing in this Section 6.11
shall require cooperation to the extent that it would (1) cause any condition
to the Closing set forth in this Agreement to not be satisfied or otherwise
cause any breach of this Agreement or (2) reasonably be expected to conflict
with or violate the Company's or any of its Affiliates' respective
organizational documents or any requirement of law, or result in the
contravention of, or result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any
Material Contract; (C) prior to the Closing, neither the Company nor any of
its Related Persons shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee or
incur, or take any action that would reasonably be expected to result in the
incurrence of, any other liability or obligation or provide any indemnity in
connection with the Debt Financing; (D) none of the Company or its Related
Persons shall be required to execute or enter into, perform or authorize any
agreement, instrument or document (other than, subject to the limitations
specified above, customary authorization letters) relating to the Debt
Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would 

be effective prior to the Closing Date; and (E) nothing shall obligate the
Company to provide, or cause to be provided, any legal opinion by its counsel
(provided, however, that (subject to the limitations in the foregoing clauses
(A) - (D) and the remainder of this clause (E)) the Company or its
Representatives shall use their reasonable best efforts to provide, or cause
to be provided, customary backup documentation for legal opinions that are
required in connection with the Debt Financing to the extent reasonably
requested by Buyer), or to provide any information or take any action to the
extent it would result in a violation of applicable requirements of law. The
Company hereby consents to the customary use of its corporate logos in the
Marketing Material in connection with the Debt Financing; provided, that such
corporate logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, nor
reasonably likely to, harm or disparage the Company.



(b)The Company and the Sellers shall not have any liability to Buyer in
respect of any financial information or data or other information provided
pursuant to this Section 6.11. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each of the Company and the Seller Related Persons and its and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the performance of the
Company's obligations under this Section 6.11 and any information utilized in
connection therewith, except to the extent such liabilities or obligations
arose out of or resulted from (i) information provided by or on behalf of the
Company, the Sellers, their respective Representatives or their respective
Related Persons or (ii) the gross negligence, fraud, bad faith, willful
misconduct or intentional misrepresentation or breach of this Agreement by the
Company, the Sellers, their respective Representatives or any of their
respective Related Persons. Buyer shall, within thirty (30) days following
written request by the Company accompanied by supporting documentation
therefor, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company (including those of its
Representatives) during the period from the date hereof through the date of
such request in connection with the cooperation required by this Section 6.11.



(c)Buyer shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Debt Financing on the terms
and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter (including, to the
extent required in accordance with the terms thereof, compliance with any
exercise of any "flex" provisions contained therein), including using
reasonable best efforts to (A) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
precedent to funding applicable to Buyer in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Financing Agreements and, upon the satisfaction (or waiver) of all of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2, to consummate the Debt
Financing no later than the Closing Date, and (B) maintain in full force and
effect the Debt Commitment Letter until the funding of the Debt Financing and
to negotiate, execute and deliver the Financing Agreements consistent with the
terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (subject to
any applicable "flex" provisions) or, if applicable, on terms that are no less
favorable to Buyer than the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
(after taking into account any "flex" provisions contained therein), (ii) upon
the satisfaction or, if deemed advisable by Parent, waiver of all conditions
precedent to funding in the Debt Commitment Letter, enforce the obligations of
the Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing, and (iii) comply in all
material respects with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter and
the Financing Agreements, to the extent within its control. Upon the
reasonable request of the Company, Buyer shall reasonably promptly update the
Company in reasonable detail with respect any material developments concerning
the status of the Debt Financing. Buyer shall provide the Company, upon
reasonable request, with copies of any Financing Agreements and such other
information and documentation regarding the Debt Financing as shall be
reasonably necessary to allow the Company to monitor the progress of such
financing activities. In the event all or any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter 

(subject to any applicable "flex" provisions), (A) Buyer shall notify the
Company, and (B) Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange to obtain alternative financing in an amount
not less than the Debt Financing reflected in the Debt Commitment Letter (the
"Alternative Financing"), upon terms and conditions no less favorable in any
respect to Buyer than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter (including with respect to the matters described in clauses
(w) through (z) hereof). Buyer shall deliver copies of the commitment letters
and related fee letters documenting the Alternative Financing (the
"Alternative Debt Commitment Letter") (which fee letters may be redacted
solely with respect to (x) the amount of fees and (y) the economic terms
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, covenants) of any "market flex"
provisions (such redaction to be in a customary manner and shall not extend to
any terms that affect the amount or availability of, or impose any additional
conditions on, the financing contemplated by the Alternative Debt Commitment
Letter)) to the Company upon execution thereof. Such Alternative Financing
shall be deemed to be a part of the "Debt Financing" and the Alternative Debt
Commitment Letter shall be deemed a "Debt Commitment Letter" for all purposes
of this Agreement. Buyer shall not permit or consent to (1) any amendment,
supplement or modification to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Debt
Commitment Letter if such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver (w)
imposes new or additional conditions, or otherwise expands any of the
conditions, to the initial funding of the Debt Financing at Closing in a
manner that would make such conditions more onerous than those set forth
therein on the date hereof, (x) would reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter, (y) would reasonably be expected to
materially impair, materially delay or prevent the availability of all or a
portion of the Debt Financing or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (z) would reduce the aggregate cash amount
of the Debt Financing to an amount that, when taken together with other funds
available to Buyer, is not sufficient to pay the aggregate Closing Cash
Consideration to be paid by Buyer at the Closing and all other amounts
required to be paid by Buyer at the Closing in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and to pay all related
fees and expenses of Buyer required to be paid at the Closing in connection
therewith; provided, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer may replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, or
(2) early termination of the Debt Commitment Letter (other than in connection
with (and solely to the extent replaced by) Alternative Financing). Buyer
shall furnish to the Company a copy of any amendment, modification or waiver
of the Debt Commitment Letter following execution thereof, in each case, to
the extent entered into prior to the Closing; provided, that amendments to fee
letters may be redacted to the same extent as the fee letters may be redacted
under Section 5.5. Buyer shall promptly notify the Company in writing (I) of
any material breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give
rise to any material breach or default) by any party to the Debt Commitment
Letter or any Financing Agreement of which Buyer obtains knowledge, (II) of
the receipt by Buyer or any of its Related Persons or Representatives of any
written notice or other written communication from any Financing Source with
respect to any actual, threatened or alleged material breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any
Financing Agreement or any provision of the Debt Financing contemplated
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreement (including
any proposal by any Financing Source to withdraw, terminate or make a material
change in the terms of (including the amount of Debt Financing contemplated
by) the Debt Commitment Letter), (III) if for any reason Buyer believes in
good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements and (IV) of the termination
or expiration prior to Closing of the Debt Commitment Letter or 

any Financing Agreement. As soon as reasonably practicable, Buyer shall
provide any material information reasonably requested by the Company relating
to any of the circumstances referred to in this Section 6.11.



Section 6.12Transactions with Affiliates. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall terminate all related party transactions set forth on Schedule 6.12
other than employee participation in Employee Benefit Plans, and all interest
holder, member, shareholder, management and members', operating agreements or
similar agreements relating to the Company or the Purchased Company Interests
such that, as of the Closing Date, the Company shall not have any liability or
obligation thereunder (or in respect thereof).



Section 6.13Reporting Requirements. From the date of this Agreement until the
one year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Sellers and, with respect to the
period prior to the Closing Date, the Company, agree to provide such
assistance with the Reporting Requirements as is reasonably requested by
Buyer. Such assistance shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(a) participation by senior management of the Company in, and assistance with,
the preparation of Buyer's, and following the Adjustment Time, the Company's,
financial statements, including pro forma financial statements and reviewed
financial statements of the Company with respect to the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2016 and the comparative nine-month period ended September
30, 2015 and the audited financial statements of the Company with respect to
the fiscal years ended 2015, 2014, and 2013 (b) using commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Company's independent auditors to cooperate with the
Reporting Requirements, including, without limitation, the delivery of
customary authorization letters, confirmation and undertakings and (c) using
commercially reasonable efforts to take such other actions and provide such
other information as is necessary for Buyer to comply with the Reporting
Requirements, including filing Form 8-K with respect to the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement.



Section 6.14Exclusivity. Prior to the Closing, Sellers, the Company and the
Affiliates, agents and representatives of the Company and Sellers, in each
case, acting on the Company's or the Sellers' behalf, as applicable, shall
not, directly or through an intermediary: (a) solicit, initiate or encourage
the submission of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company; (b)
enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal with respect
to the Company; or (c) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information for the purpose of
facilitating the making of, or take any other action to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of, any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company
or its business. The Parties agree that the unsolicited receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal by the Company, the Sellers or any of their respective
officers, directors, governors, managers, employees, attorneys or other agents
or representatives shall not constitute a breach of this Section 6.14.



Section 6.15Section 280G Matters. Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers'
Representative and the Company will submit to a vote (along with adequate
disclosure satisfying the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the
Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder) the right of any
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.280G-1)) to receive any payment that could constitute a "parachute
payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) and as
to which such individual waives his or her rights as described in the
following sentence in a manner that satisfies the shareholder approval
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and any regulations promulgated
thereunder to the extent necessary to cause any such payment not to constitute
an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code. To the extent that any such "disqualified individual" has the right to
receive payments that could constitute "parachute payments" and elects to
waive such rights, the Company will obtain waivers of such rights prior to
soliciting the vote described in the immediately preceding sentence such that
the vote will, if successful, 

establish each "disqualified individual's" right to the payment. The Sellers'
Representative and the Company will provide, or cause to be provided, to the
Buyer a draft of all shareholder vote related documents, including, but not
limited to, any disclosure documents and "disqualified individual" waiver. The
Sellers' Representative and the Company will incorporate any reasonable
comments that are made by Buyer. The Parties agree that the reasonable
attorneys' fees associated with the Company's compliance with this Section
6.15 shall be paid by Buyer, up to a maximum of $20,000, and not be included
as a Seller Expense. Any amounts in excess of $20,000 shall be included as a
Seller Expense hereunder.

TERMINATION; AMENDMENT; WAIVER



Section 8.1Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time prior to the

(a)by mutual written consent of Buyer, Sellers' Representative and the
Company;



(b)by Buyer, if any of the representations or warranties of the Company or the
Sellers set forth in Article III or Article IV is not true and correct or if
the Sellers or the Company has failed to perform or comply with any covenant
or agreement set forth in this Agreement (including an obligation to
consummate the Closing), in each case, such that a condition to Closing set
forth in Section 7.2(a), Section 7.2(b) or Section 7.2(d) would not be
satisfied and the breach or breaches causing such representations or
warranties not to be true and correct, or the failures to perform or comply
with any covenant or agreement, as applicable, are not cured prior to the
earlier of (i) the Business Day prior to the Termination Date and (ii) the
date that is 20 days after written notice thereof is delivered to the Sellers'
Representative; provided, that Buyer is not then in breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement, which breach
causes or would reasonably be expected to cause a condition to Closing set
forth in either Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) to fail to be satisfied;



(c)by the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of all Sellers and the Company),
if any of the representations or warranties of Buyer set forth in Article V is
not true and correct or if Buyer has failed to perform or comply with any
covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this Agreement
(including an obligation to consummate the Closing), in each case, such that

satisfied; and provided further, that such 20-day cure period will not apply
to any failure by Buyer to consummate the Closing as required by Section 2.4;



(d)by the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of all Sellers and the Company)
if (i) the conditions to the obligations of Buyer to consummate the Closing
set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 were satisfied or waived as of the
date the Closing should have been consummated pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be

material part to a breach by Buyer of this Agreement) and (ii) Buyer fails to
consummate the Closing by the later of (a) the date the Closing should have
been consummated pursuant to Section 2.4 and (b) two (2) Business Days after

(e)by the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of all Sellers and the Company)

to this Section 8.1(e) is not in breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant set forth in this Agreement, which breach causes or would be
reasonably expected to cause of any of the conditions set forth in Section
7.2(a), Section 7.2(b), Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) to fail to be
satisfied; provided that, if the Marketing Period shall have begun but not

Marketing Period.



The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1
(other than Section 8.1(a)) shall give prompt written notice of such

Section 8.2Effect of Termination.



(a)In the event of termination of this Agreement, by either Buyer or the
Sellers' Representative in accordance herewith, the provisions of this
Agreement will immediately become void and of no further force or effect
except (i) nothing herein will relieve Buyer or Company from any liability or
damages to the other for any Willful Breach by Buyer or the Company of their
respective covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement and (ii) that
the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of Section 6.2 (Public
Announcements), this Section 8.2 (Effect of Termination), Section 10.4 (Entire
Agreement; Assignment), Section 10.5 (Notices), Section 10.7 (Governing Law),
Section 10.8 (Fees and Expenses), Section 10.9 (Interpretation), Section 10.10
(Exhibits and Schedules), Section 10.11 (Parties in Interest), Section 10.12
(Severability), Section 10.14 (No Recourse), Section 10.15 (Waiver of Jury
Trial), Section 10.16 (Jurisdiction and Venue), Section 10.17 (Specific
Performance), Section 10.18 (Waiver of Conflicts), Section 10.19 (No Recourse

shall survive the termination hereof.



(b)If (i) the Sellers' Representative terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(c), or Section 8.1(d) or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by any
Party at a time when the Sellers' Representative would be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or Section 8.1(d) (in each
case, without giving effect to any notice requirement or cure period set forth
therein), then, the Parties agree that the Company and the Sellers shall have
suffered a loss and value of an incalculable nature and amount, unrecoverable
in Law, and Buyer shall pay to Sellers (or the Company, if so directed by the
Sellers' Representative) a fee of $35,000,000.00 (the "Buyer Termination Fee")
as liquidated damages, it being understood that in no event shall Buyer be
required to pay the Buyer Termination Fee on more than one occasion. The Buyer
Termination Fee shall be payable in immediately available funds by wire
transfer (to an account designated by the Sellers' Representative) no later
than three (3) Business Days after such termination. Solely for purposes of
establishing the basis for the amount of the Buyer Termination Fee, it is
agreed that the Buyer Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated
damages (in the event it is paid) in a reasonable amount to compensate the
Sellers and the Company in the circumstances in which such fee is payable, for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, which amount would otherwise be difficult to calculate with any
precision.



(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and except to
the extent that specific performance is available under Section 10.17, the
Sellers' right to receive payment of the Buyer Termination Fee, together with
any indemnification or reimbursement pursuant to Section 6.11(b) and Section
8.2(d) (collectively, the "Recoverable Amounts") shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company or the Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates, whether or not the Sellers shall have terminated this Agreement,
against Buyer, its Affiliates or any of their respective former, current and
future direct or 

indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, members, managers, general or limited partners or
assignees (collectively, the "Buyer Related Parties") or any Financing Source
and any of their respective former, current and future direct or indirect
equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners
or assignees for any and all losses that may be suffered based upon, resulting
from or arising out of the circumstances giving rise to such termination,
including for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Purchase or
the Debt Financing to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or under the Debt Commitment Letter, other than for a Willful
Breach. Upon payment of the Recoverable Amounts in accordance with this
Section 8.2, none of the Buyer Related Parties or any Financing Source and any
of their respective former, current and future direct or indirect equity
holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or
assignees shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Documents or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Documents,
other than for a Willful Breach.



(d)The Parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company would not have
entered into this Agreement. Accordingly if Buyer fails to promptly pay the
Buyer Termination Fee when due pursuant to this Section 8.2 and the Company
commences a suit that results in a judgment against Buyer, Buyer shall pay to
an account or accounts designated by the Sellers' Representative the Sellers'
and the Company's costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount
due pursuant to this Section 8.2 from the date such payment was required to be
made hereunder until the date of payment at a rate of 8% per annum. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that the fees and other provisions of this
Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, without these agreements, the Parties would not have entered
into this Agreement.



ARTICLE IX

NON-SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS



Section 9.1Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants.



(a)The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement will not survive beyond the Closing such that no claim for breach of
any such representation or warranty, detrimental reliance or other right or
remedy (whether in contract, in tort or at law or in equity) may be brought
after the Closing with respect thereto against the Company, the Sellers, the
Sellers' Representative or any of their respective Affiliates, or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors
and permitted assigns (the "Seller Group"), and there will be no liability in
respect thereof, whether such liability has accrued prior to, on or after the
Closing, on the part of the Company or any other member of the Seller Group,
except in the case of Fraud and in the case of those covenants and agreements
contained herein that by their express terms apply or are to be performed in
whole or in part after the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in any provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall
limit Buyer's (or any of its Affiliates') ability to make a claim under the
RandW Policy, it being understood that the RandW Policy shall be the sole recourse
of Buyer for any breach of any representation or warranty under this
Agreement.



(b)Buyer, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, and any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors
and permitted assigns (including, after the Closing, the 

Company) (each a "Waiving Party"), acknowledges and agrees that, from and
after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have against any Person in
the Seller Group relating to the business conducted by the Company as of the
date hereof, the operation of the Company, or their respective businesses or
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or any Exhibit or the
Schedules hereto, or any ancillary agreement, certificate or other document
entered into, made, delivered, or made available in connection herewith, or as
a result of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether
arising under, or based upon, any federal, state, local or foreign statute,
Law, ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise (including any right, whether
arising at law or in equity, to seek indemnification, contribution, cost
recovery, damages or any other recourse or remedy, including as may arise
under common law) are hereby irrevocably waived by the Waiving Parties.
Furthermore, without limiting the generality of this Section 9.1, (a) no claim
will be brought or maintained by, or on behalf of, Buyer or any other Waiving
Party (including, after the Closing, the Company) against the Company or any
other member of the Seller Group, and no recourse will be sought or granted
against any of them, by virtue of, or based upon, any alleged
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the representations,
warranties or covenants of the Company or any other Person set forth or
contained in this Agreement or any Exhibit or Schedules hereto, or any
ancillary agreement, certificate or other document entered into, made,
delivered, or made available in connection herewith, or as a result of any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that the Waiving Parties may not avoid such limitation on liability by (i)
seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory
of liability, all of which are hereby waived or (ii) asserting or threatening
any claim against any Person that is not a party hereto (or a successor to a
party hereto) for breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that the limits imposed on the Waiving Parties' remedies with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby were bargained for
between sophisticated parties and were specifically taken into account in the
determination of the amounts to be paid by Buyer hereunder. Nothing in this
Section 9.1(b) shall be deemed to be a waiver of claims for Fraud.



(c)BUYER, ON BEHALF OF THE WAIVING PARTIES, EXPRESSLY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHTS AFFORDED BY ANY STATUTE OR COMMON LAW PRINCIPLES WHICH LIMITS THE
EFFECT OF A RELEASE WITH RESPECT TO UNKNOWN CLAIMS. BUYER ON BEHALF OF THE
WAIVING PARTIES, ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT UNDERSTANDS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS
RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS AND WAIVER OF ANY STATUTORY PROTECTION AGAINST A
RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS. BUYER, ON BEHALF OF THE WAIVING PARTIES,
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS WAIVER IS AN ESSENTIAL AND MATERIAL TERM OF
THIS AGREEMENT.



ARTICLE X

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 10.1Tax Matters.



(a)All federal, state, local, or foreign or other excise, sales, use, transfer
(including real property transfer), intangible, recordation, documentary stamp
or similar Taxes or charges, of any nature whatsoever (including any penalties
and interest) that are imposed on any of the Parties by any Governmental
Entity or Taxing Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby ("Transfer Taxes") will be shared equally by Buyer and Sellers when
due, and all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
Transfer Taxes will be prepared and filed by the party required to file such
Tax Returns under applicable Law.



(b)The Sellers and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents and auditors reasonably to
cooperate, in (i) preparing and filing all Tax Returns of the Acquired
Companies, including maintaining and making available to each other all
records necessary in connection with Taxes; (ii) resolving all disputes and
audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes; and (iii)
providing timely notice to each other in writing of any pending or threatened
Tax audits or assessments for all taxable periods for which the other may have
a liability under this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree to file
all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the tax characterization of the
transactions contemplated hereby as described in Section 2.7(a).



(c)The Company shall have in place a valid election under Section 754 of the
Code with respect to any taxable year (or portion thereof) that ends on or
includes the Closing Date.



(d)The Sellers and Buyer agree that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will result in the "termination" of the Company under Section
708(b)(1)(B) of the Code. To the extent permitted by Law, any Tax deductions
arising out of the payment of Seller Expenses or from other costs and expenses
incurred by the Company or the Blocker in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be (i) allocated to, and claimed on Tax
Returns relating to, the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and (ii) solely with respect
to the Blocker, allocated pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1) (and not pursuant to the "next day" rule under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)). With respect to any
Straddle Period, Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes) will be allocated to the
portion of the period ending on the Closing Date using the following
conventions: (i) in the case of all Taxes other than ad valorem property
Taxes, including, without limitation, income Taxes, Taxes resulting from, or
imposed on, sales, receipts, uses, transfers or assignments of property, or
payments to other Persons (including wages), the amount of Taxes allocated to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date will be the
amount of Taxes payable for such portion of the period ending on the Closing
Date utilizing the "closing of the books" methodology, and (ii) in the case of
ad valorem property taxes, the amount of Taxes allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date will equal to the amount of Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period.



(e)All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements (other than (x) any such
agreement or arrangement that is solely between or among the Acquired
Companies, or (y) commercial agreements or arrangements the principal subject
matter of which is not Taxes) with respect to or involving an Acquired Company
or any Subsidiary thereof, on the one hand, and another Person, on the other
hand, shall be terminated prior to the Closing and, after the Closing, no
Acquired Company or any Subsidiary thereof shall be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder. All powers of attorney with respect to or involving an
Acquired Company or any Subsidiary thereof shall be terminated prior to the
Closing and, after the Closing, no Acquired Company or any Subsidiary thereof
shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.



(f)Buyer shall cause the Company to prepare and file all Tax Returns of the
Acquired Companies that are required to be filed after the Closing Date. Any
such Tax Return that is related to a taxable period (or portion thereof) that
began prior to the Closing Date shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice unless otherwise required by Law and shall be provided to the
Sellers' Representative no later than twenty (20) days prior to the due date
for filing thereof (including extensions) for Sellers' Representative's review
and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld) (except where such 20-day
period is not practical, in which case as soon as practical). In the event
that Sellers' Representative does not approve, the Sellers' 

Representative shall provide any comments to such Tax Returns in writing
within ten (10) days of Sellers' Representative's receipt of such Tax Returns
(except where such 10-day period is not practical, in which case as soon as
practical). The Parties will attempt to resolve in good faith any disputes
with respect to such comments subject to the dispute resolution procedures of
Section 2.7(b). In no event will the provision of comments by Sellers'
Representative prevent Buyer from timely filing any such Tax Return; provided,
however, that in the event that the Accounting Firm has not yet resolved any
such dispute prior to the deadline for filing such Tax Return (including any
extensions), Buyer will be entitled to file such Tax Return as prepared by
Buyer subject to amendment to reflect the resolution when rendered by the
Accounting Firm.



(g)Unless required by Law or otherwise consented to by the Sellers'
Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delated),
Buyer shall not file any amended Tax Returns with respect to Taxes for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period. Sellers will not take any action to cause the Company
to be subject to the BBA Partnership Audit Rules for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period.



(h)If the Blocker has a net operating loss for its taxable year ending on the
Closing Date as a result of Transaction Deductions, the Sellers'
Representative will cause the Blocker to file an Internal Revenue Service Form
1139 (Corporation Application for Tentative Refund) and corresponding state
and local income Tax Returns for the immediately preceding Tax years of the
Company. Any refund of Taxes received as a result of such filings that are
related to Transaction Deductions will be paid to the Blocker Seller within 30
days of Buyer or the Blocker receiving such refunds. Any refunds paid to the
Blocker Seller will be net of (i) Taxes of Buyer or any Acquired Company
resulting from such refunds, (ii) any reasonable out-of-pocket costs
associated in obtaining such refund (including the costs of preparing such
refund claims), and (iii) any Tax required to be withheld on such payment.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer will not be required to
pay any amounts to Sellers for any Tax benefits realized in a Post-Closing Tax
Period relating to Transaction Deductions, including, without limitation, as a
result of a carryforward of a net operating loss to a Post-Closing Tax Period.



(i)Except as provided in Section 10.1(j), Buyer will represent the interests
of the Company in any audit, examination, investigation, claim, contest,
dispute, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes by or against
any Taxing Authority (a "Tax Claim") in respect of a Tax Return of the
Acquired Companies; provided, that to the extent any such Tax Claim may affect
the tax liability of a Seller (i) Buyer will provide Sellers' Representative
with copies of all correspondence, notices and other written materials
received from any Taxing Authorities and will otherwise keep Sellers'
Representative and its tax advisor advised of significant developments
regarding the Tax Claim and of significant communications involving
representatives of the Taxing Authorities, (ii) Buyer will provide Sellers'
Representative with a copy of any material written submission to be sent to a
Taxing Authority at least twenty (20) days prior to the submission thereof and
will consider any reasonable comments or suggested revisions that Sellers'
Representative may have with respect thereto and (iii) to the extent the Tax
Claim relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Sellers' Representative will be
able to participate in such Tax Claim at Sellers' sole cost and expense, and
Buyer will not settle or otherwise resolve such Tax Claim without the consent
of Sellers' Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.



(j)Provided that Sellers' Representative notifies Buyer in writing of its
intention to do so within 30 days of receipt of written notice from Buyer of a
Tax Claim subject to this Section 10.1(j), Sellers' Representative may
represent the interests of the Company in any Tax Claim in respect of a Pre-
Closing Tax Period solely relating to income Taxes; provided, that to the
extent any such Tax Claim may affect the tax liability of Buyer (i) Sellers'
Representative will provide Buyer with copies of all material 

correspondence, notices and other written materials received from any Taxing
Authorities and will otherwise keep Buyer and its tax advisor reasonably
advised of significant developments regarding the Tax Claim and of significant
communications involving representatives of the Taxing Authorities, (ii)
Sellers' Representative will provide Buyer with a copy of any material written
submission to be sent to a Taxing Authority at least twenty (20) days prior to
the submission thereof and will consider any reasonable comments or suggested
revisions that Buyer may have with respect thereto; and (iii) Sellers'
Representative will not settle or otherwise resolve such Tax Claim without the
prior written consent of Buyer, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.



Section 10.2Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a
written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of Buyer,
the Company and the Sellers' Representative. This Agreement may not be
modified or amended except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence
and any purported amendment by any party or parties effected in a manner which
does not comply with this Section 10.2 will be void. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Sections 10.11, 10.15, 10.16 and
10.19 and this Section 10.2 (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent
an amendment, supplement, waiver or modification of such provision would
modify the substance of any of such provisions in a manner that is materially
adverse to a Financing Source) may not be amended, supplemented, waived or
otherwise modified in a manner that is materially adverse to a Financing
Source without the prior written consent of such Financing Source, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



Section 10.3Extension; Waiver. Subject to Section 8.1(d), at any time prior to
the Closing, the Sellers' Representative and the Company may (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Buyer
contained herein, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of Buyer contained herein or in any document, certificate or
writing delivered by Buyer pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance by Buyer
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Subject to Section
8.1(d), at any time prior to the Closing, Buyer may (i) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the Company or the
Sellers contained herein, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties of the Sellers contained herein or in any document, certificate
or writing delivered by the Company or the Sellers pursuant hereto or (iii)
waive compliance by the Company or the Sellers with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any Party to any
such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure or delay of any Party
to assert any of its rights hereunder will not constitute a waiver of such
rights. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or
remedy by such Party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or remedy.



Section 10.4Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement (including the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto), the Ancillary Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all other
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement will not
be assigned by any Party (whether by operation of law or otherwise); provided,
however, that Buyer may assign any or all of its rights and interests
hereunder (a) to one or more of its Affiliates, (b) solely for collateral
security purposes in connection with the Debt Financing, to any Financing
Sources, and (c) to any subsequent purchaser of Buyer or any material portion
of its assets (whether such sale is structured as a sale of stock or
membership interests, a sale of assets, a merger or otherwise). No assignment
shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder. 

Any attempted assignment of this Agreement not in accordance with the terms of
this Section 10.4 will be void.



Section 10.5Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder will be in writing and will be given (and will be
deemed to have been duly given upon receipt) by delivery in person, by
facsimile (subject to non-automated confirmation of receipt), e-mail (subject
to non-automated confirmation of receipt), or by registered or certified mail

Section 10.6Notice of Certain Events. The Company or Sellers' Representative,
as applicable, shall promptly notify Buyer in writing, upon the Company's
Knowledge (but with no duty to investigate), of any development occurring
after the date of this Agreement that would cause or constitute a material
breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement if such representation or warranty had been made at the time of such
development, if such development would, individually or in the aggregate,
cause any condition in Sections 7.2(a), 7.2(b) or 7.3(a) to not be satisfied
at Closing such that the Buyer would have a right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(b) (such development, a "Supplemental Disclosure"). A
Supplemental Disclosure shall not diminish Buyer's right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) and a Supplemental Disclosure shall not
be deemed to cure any breaches of representations or warranties for purposes
of determining the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Sections 7.2(a)
and (b), and no such notification of Supplemental Disclosure pursuant to
clause (a) above shall in any way diminish the right or ability of Buyer to
bring a claim against the RandW Policy.

Section 10.7Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.



Section 10.8Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the fees and
disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants, will be paid by
the Party incurring such fees or expenses.



Section 10.9Interpretation.



(a)Unless otherwise expressly provided or unless the context requires
otherwise: (i) all references in this Agreement to Articles, Sections,
Schedules and Exhibits shall mean and refer to Articles, Sections, Schedules
and Exhibits of this Agreement; (ii) all references to statutes and related
regulations shall include all amendments of the same and any successor or
replacement statutes and regulations; (iii) words using the singular or plural
number also shall include the plural or singular number, respectively; (iv)
references to "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and similar terms shall refer to

and permitted assigns of such Person (or, in the case of a Governmental
Entity, Persons succeeding to the relevant functions of such Person); (vi) the
term "including" shall be deemed to mean "including, without limitation;"
(vii) words of any gender shall include each other gender; (viii) whenever
this Agreement refers to a number of days, such number shall refer to calendar
days, unless such reference is specifically to "Business Days," (ix) the terms
"year" and "years" mean and refer to calendar year(s); (x) the term "dollars"
and all uses of "$" shall mean United States dollars and references in this 

Agreement to dollar amount thresholds or baskets shall not be deemed to be
evidence of materiality; and (xi) the term "or" has the inclusive meaning
represented by the phrase "and/or." With regard to all dates and time periods
set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.



(b)The Article and Section headings contained in this Agreement are solely for
the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties and
shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
This Agreement is the product of negotiations among the Parties, each of which
is represented by legal counsel, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. Rules of construction relating to interpretation
against the drafter of an agreement shall not apply to this Agreement and are
expressly waived by each party.



Section 10.10Exhibits and Schedules. All exhibits, annexes and schedules, or
documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement, are hereby incorporated
into this Agreement and are hereby made a part of this Agreement as if set out
in full in this Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount in the
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of
any specific item in any Schedule is not intended to imply that such amounts,
or higher or lower amounts or the items so included or other items, are or are
not material, and no Party will use the fact of the setting of such amounts or
the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy as to whether any
obligation, items or matter not described herein or included in a Schedule is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.



Section 10.11Parties in Interest. This Agreement will be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted
assigns and, except as provided in Section 6.7 and Article IX, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any other
Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Financing Sources
and their respective Financing Source Affiliates are intended beneficiaries of
Sections 10.2, 10.15, 10.16 and 10.19 and this Section 10.11 and shall have
the right to rely on and enforce Sections 10.2, 10.15, 10.16 and 10.19 and
this Section 10.11.



Section 10.12Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement will
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party.



Section 10.13Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an
original, but all of which will constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or scanned pages will be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart to this Agreement.



Section 10.14No Recourse. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, all claims
or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity) that
may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as
an inducement to enter into this Agreement), may be made only against the
entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto. No Person who is not
a named Party to this Agreement, including without limitation any past,
present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
equityholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any named Party
to this Agreement ("Non-Party Affiliates"), shall have any liability (whether
in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon any theory that
seeks to impose liability 

of an entity party against its owners or affiliates) for any obligations or
liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its
negotiation or execution; and each Party hereto waives and releases all such
liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliate.



Section 10.15Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, THE ANCILLARY DOCUMENTS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF ANY OF THE FINANCING AGREEMENTS,
THE PERFORMANCE THEREUNDER OR THE FINANCINGS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY). EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER,
(II) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) SUCH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.15.



Section 10.16Jurisdiction and Venue. Each of the Parties (i) submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of federal and state courts located in Delaware in any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (ii) agrees that all
claims in respect of such Action may be heard and determined in any such court
and (iii) agrees not to bring any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement in any other court. Each of the Parties waives any defense of
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any Action so brought and waives any
bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other Party with
respect thereto. Each Party agrees that service of summons and complaint or
any other process that might be served in any Action may be made on such Party
by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at
the address of the Party and in the manner provided for the giving of notices
in Section 10.5. Nothing in this Section 10.16, however, will affect the right
of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. Each
Party agrees that a final, non appealable judgment in any Action so brought
will be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, each party hereto: (a) agrees that it will not bring or support any
Action of any kind or description (including any cross-claim or third-party
claim), whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any of the Financing Sources or their respective Financing
Source Affiliates in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to any of the Financing Agreements or the
performance thereof, in each case, in any forum other than exclusively the
Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or,
if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal
courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan (and any appellate courts thereof), (b)
submits for itself and its property with respect to any such action to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (c) agrees that service or process,
summons, notice of document by registered mail addressed to it at its address
provided in Section 10.5 shall be effective service of process against it for
any such action brought in any such court, (d) hereby irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of any inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court, (e) agrees
that a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may 

be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law, (f) agrees that any such Action shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York and (g)
agrees to irrevocably waive and hereby waives any right to a trial by jury in
any such action to the same extent such rights are waived pursuant to Section
10.15.



Section 10.17Specific Performance.



(a)The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the Parties
hereto in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company and the
Sellers, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable) and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and to
thereafter cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions thereto set forth in
this Agreement. The foregoing rights are in addition to and without limitation
of any other remedy to which the Parties may be entitled at law or in equity.
The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.
Each of the Parties hereto hereby waives (i) any defenses in any action for
specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law would be
adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. If any party brings
any action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof by any other party, the Termination Date shall automatically be
extended by (x) the amount of time during which such action is pending, plus
20 Business Days or (y) such other later date established by the Delaware
court presiding over such Action. The Parties hereto further agree that (i) by
seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 10.17, no Party shall in any
respect waive its right to seek at any time any other form of relief that may
be available to it under this Agreement or any other agreement or document
entered into in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including monetary damages) in the event that this Agreement has been
terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this Section
10.17 are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set
forth in this Section 10.17 shall require any Party hereto to institute any
proceeding for (or limit any party's right to institute any proceeding for)
specific performance under this Section 10.17 prior to or as a condition to
exercising any termination right under Article VIII, nor shall the
commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to this Section 10.17 or
anything set forth in this Section 10.17 restrict or limit any Party's right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VIII or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement any other agreement or document
entered into in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby
that may be available then or thereafter.



(b)Notwithstanding Section 10.17(a), but without limiting such Party's right
to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies for any
other obligations, covenants or agreements of Buyer hereunder, it is hereby
acknowledged and agreed that the Company and Sellers shall only be entitled to
cause Buyer to consummate the Closing in the event that (x) the Marketing
Period has ended and all of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2
(other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing
or the failure of which to be satisfied are due in any material part to a
breach by Buyer of any of its Section 10.17(a) covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement) have been satisfied or waived on the date the
Closing should have been consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
but for the failure of Buyer to effect the Closing in accordance with Section
2.4, (y) the Company and Sellers' Representative have confirmed in writing
that if specific performance is granted, then they would take such actions
that are within their control to cause the Closing to occur (including waiving
any unsatisfied 

conditions in Section 7.3), and (z) the full proceeds to be provided to Buyer
by the Debt Financing shall be available to Buyer to consummate the Closing.
Notwithstanding the prior sentence, no rights granted to the Company or
Sellers hereunder shall reduce, alter or modify the rights of the Financing
Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter.

(c)Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 10.17 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, such Party would not enter into
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Sellers may pursue both
payment of the Buyer Termination Fee and a grant of specific performance or
other equitable relief pursuant hereto, under no circumstances shall the
Company or Sellers be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance of the consummation of the Closing pursuant to this
Section 10.17 and the payment of all or any portion of the Buyer Termination
Fee.



Section 10.18Waiver of Conflicts.



(a)Each of Buyer and the Company, for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby
irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications pertaining to the
Seller Group and their counsel, including Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, Kirkland
and Ellis LLP and Barnes and Thornburg LLP, made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement or relating
to the process for the sale of the Company by the Sellers, are privileged
communications between the Seller Group and such counsel and none of Buyer,
the Company or any of the Waiving Parties, nor any Person purporting to act on
behalf of or through Buyer or the Company or any of the Waiving Parties, will
seek to obtain the same by any process; provided, that applicable
communications between the Company and its legal counsel, in each case that
were not made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement or that do not relate to the process for the sale
of the Company by the Sellers shall pass to the Company. From and after the
Closing, each of Buyer and the Company, on behalf of itself and the Waiving
Parties, waives and will not assert any attorney-client privilege with respect
to any communication between Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, Kirkland and Ellis LLP,
Barnes and Thornburg LLP and the Company or any Person in the Seller Group
occurring during the representation in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.



(b)Buyer hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Waiving
Parties, that Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Barnes and
Thornburg LLP may serve as counsel to each and any Person of the Seller Group,
on the one hand, and the Acquired Companies, on the other hand, in connection
with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and that, following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Weil, Gotshal and Manges
LLP, Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Barnes and Thornburg LLP may serve as counsel to
each and any Person in the Seller Group in connection with any dispute,
litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement notwithstanding such prior representation of the Company and/or any
of its Subsidiaries or in connection with any other matter relating to the
process for the sale of the Company by the Sellers. Each of Buyer and the
Company hereby consents to and irrevocably waives (individually and on behalf
of itself and on behalf of its Affiliates and any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors and
permitted assigns (including, after the Closing, the Company) claiming by,
through or on behalf of any of them) any conflicts that may arise in
connection with such representation.



Section 10.19No Recourse to Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein: (a) no Seller Related Party shall have any rights
or claims against any Financing Source or any of its respective Financing
Source Affiliates in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise; provided that, the foregoing will not limit
any Financing Source's obligations to Buyer under the Debt Commitment Letter;
and (b) no Financing Source or its respective Financing Source Affiliates
shall be subject to any special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages
or damages of a tortious nature.



Section 10.20Post-Closing Merger. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Parties and the Sellers' Representative acknowledge and
agree that, at any time after the Closing, Buyer will be permitted to effect a
merger of the Blocker with and into Buyer, with Buyer as the surviving
corporation and the successor by operation of law to all of the rights and
obligations of the Blocker under this Agreement.



Section 10.21Parent Guaranty. Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to the Company and the Sellers the due and punctual payment and
performance by Buyer (and any permitted assignees thereof) of Buyer's
obligations and performance under this Agreement (the "Guaranteed
Obligations"), including to pay the Closing Cash Consideration and Closing
Stock Consideration pursuant to Article II of this Agreement and the Buyer
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2 of this Agreement, subject to the
terms and conditions hereof. The foregoing sentence is an absolute,
unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual discharge and
performance of the Guaranteed Obligations. Should Buyer default in the
discharge or performance of all or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations,
the obligations of Parent hereunder shall become immediately due and, if
applicable, payable. Parent represents and warrants to the Company as follows:
(i) Parent is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of Delaware and has the requisite organizational power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder, except where the failure to have such power or
authority would not prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by Parent has been duly authorized by all necessary
organizational action, and no other proceedings or actions on the part of
Parent are necessary therefor; (iii) this Agreement constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent, and is enforceable against Parent in
accordance with its terms, subject to Laws of general application relating to
public policy, bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors and rules of
Law governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies and (iv) assuming the truth and accuracy of the Company's
representations and warranties in Section 3.5 and the Sellers' representations
and warranties in Section 4.3, the execution, delivery or performance by
Parent of this Agreement will not contravene, conflict with or result in a
violation of any Laws to which Parent is subject or bound, and there is no
action, suit, claim or legal, administrative or arbitral proceeding pending
or, to its knowledge, threatened by or against it with respect to any of the
transactions contemplated by this Section 10.21.
