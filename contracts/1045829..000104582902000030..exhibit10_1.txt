          plus      (v)  such other capital expenditures incurred
                    by Seller from and after the Effective Date
                    and prior to the Closing Date that are
                    approved in writing by both Seller and by
                    Keith B. Pitts, Vice Chairman of Buyer, such
                    approval not to be unreasonably withheld (the
                    "Special Capital Expenditures").

          (b)  No more than three days prior to the Closing Date, Seller,
     at its sole cost and expense, shall conduct (and Buyer shall be
     entitled to monitor at its sole cost and expense) a physical
     count as of such date of the Inventory that is useable in the
     ordinary course of the Hospital Businesses (having due regard for
     the services offered by the Hospital Businesses as of the
     Effective Date), and shall prepare a schedule indicating the
     value of such Inventory (determined at cost on a first-in first-
     out basis for each item).  Seller shall give Buyer at least five
     business days' prior written notice of the date that the
     Inventory is to be counted and shall permit Buyer to monitor the
     count. The Parties acknowledge that the physical count to be
     taken pursuant to this Section 2.5(b) will not be conducted until
     just prior to the Closing Date and, therefore, the results of
     such physical count will not be available until some time after
     the Closing Date.  Accordingly, for purposes of the Closing
     Balance Sheet, the Net Working Capital shall reflect the value of
     the Inventory determined pursuant to the physical count described
     in this Section.

          (c)  No more than three business days prior to Closing, Buyer and
     Seller shall agree on the value as of the Closing Date of the
     Prepaids to be purchased by Buyer and estimates of fees, expenses
     and other items as of the Closing Date.  Buyer shall pay to
     Seller at Closing by wire transfer of immediately available funds
     to the account or accounts designated by Seller in writing an
     amount (the "Cash Portion of the Purchase Price") equal to the
     Purchase Price minus (i) the Assumed Debt, (ii) $3,500,000, as
     the agreed value of the Unbooked Employee Benefits, (iii) the
     value of the other Assumed Liabilities described in clause (vi)
     of the definition of "Assumed Liabilities" as scheduled on
     Schedule 2.3(b), (iv) $30,000,000, payable by delivery of the
     Preferred Shares, and (v) $17,641,800, payable by delivery of the
     Subordinated Note, and (vi) $358,200, payable by delivery of the
     General Partner Shares.  Within 60 days after the Closing Date,
     Seller will deliver to Buyer the Closing Balance Sheet, prepared
     in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

				18
<PAGE>

     consistently applied, and the Cash Portion of the Purchase Price
     and deductions described above in this Section 2.5(c) shall be
     recalculated, after taking into account any prorations under
     Section 2.6, to reflect the difference between $23,000,000 (as
     adjusted in the manner described in the first sentence of this
     Section) and the Net Working Capital on the Closing Balance Sheet
     (the "Post-Closing Adjustments"), provided that such
     recalculation shall be dollar-for-dollar in the differences
     between such booked amounts and no consideration in the
     recalculations shall be given to the fact that under generally
     accepted accounting principles consistently applied a materiality
     standard applies to Financial Statements.  If Buyer disputes any
     entry in the Closing Balance Sheet relevant to the calculation of
     the Post-Closing Adjustments, and/or disputes the value of the
     Inventory, and such dispute is not resolved to the mutual
     satisfaction of Seller and Buyer within 90 days after the Closing
     Date, Seller and Buyer each shall have the right to require that
     such dispute be submitted to a certified independent public
     accounting firm as Seller and Buyer may then mutually agree upon
     in writing (the "Independent Accountant"), acting as experts and
     not as arbitrators, to review Seller's books and resolve the
     computation or verification of the disputed Closing Balance Sheet
     entries in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and
     otherwise where applicable in accordance with generally accepted
     accounting principles applied on a consistent basis.  The
     Independent Accountant shall make its determination of the Post-
     Closing Adjustments, if any, within 30 days of its engagement by
     the Parties.  The determination of the Independent Accountant
     shall be final and binding on the Parties.  Seller and Buyer
     shall equally split the fees and expenses of any such submission
     to the Independent Accountant.

          (d)  If the amount of the Purchase Price owed by Buyer to Seller
     increases or is reduced as a result of the Post-Closing
     Adjustments, each Party shall make appropriate payment to the
     other within five business days after determination of the amount
     or amounts owed by or to such Party.  Any payment required by
     this Section shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
     available funds to an account or accounts designated by the
     payee, and the Parties shall execute such receipts or other
     acknowledgments as are reasonably necessary to evidence such
     payments.

          (e)  At Closing, the General Partner shall issue and deliver to
     Seller a stock certificate evidencing Seller's ownership of the
     General Partner Shares and Vanguard shall issue and deliver to
     Seller (i) a certificate evidencing Seller's ownership of the
     Preferred Shares and (ii) the Subordinated Note.

     2.6. Prorations.  At Closing, and to the extent not included in
Net Working Capital, Buyer and Seller shall prorate real estate
and personal property lease payments, real estate and personal
property Taxes and other assessments, and all other income and
expenses (including utilities) with respect to the Assets which
are normally prorated upon a sale of assets of a going concern.
There will be no proration of real estate or other Taxes in
respect of which Seller is exempt immediately prior to Closing
from the payment of such Taxes.

     2.7. Allocation of Purchase Price.  The Purchase Price shall be
allocated among the Assets as proposed by Buyer and approved by
Seller, in accordance with their fair market values consistent

				19
<PAGE>

with section 1060 of the Code and as set forth on Schedule 2.7.
Such allocation shall be binding upon the Parties for all
applicable federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes. Seller
and Buyer shall report gain or loss or cost basis, as the case
may be, in a manner consistent with such allocation on all Tax
Returns filed by any of them after Closing and not voluntarily
take any inconsistent position therewith in any administrative or
judicial proceeding relating to such returns.  Seller and Buyer
shall exchange mutually acceptable and completed Internal Revenue
Service Forms 8594 (including supplemental forms, if required),
which they shall use to report the transaction contemplated
hereunder to the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with such
allocation.

3.0. Representations and Warranties of Seller

     Except as disclosed in the Schedules, Seller makes the
following representations and warranties to Buyer on and as of
the Effective Date and shall be deemed to make them again at and
as of the Closing:

     3.1. Organization.  Seller is a non-profit corporation duly
organized and validly existing in good standing under the laws of
the State of Texas.  Seller is not licensed, qualified or
admitted to do business in any jurisdiction other than in the
State of Texas and there is no other jurisdiction in which the
ownership, use or leasing of any of Seller's assets or
properties, or the conduct or nature of its business, makes such
licensing, qualification or admission necessary.

     3.2. Powers; Consents; Absence of Conflicts, Etc.  Seller has the
requisite power and authority to conduct the Hospital Businesses
as now being conducted, to enter into this Agreement and to
perform its obligations hereunder.  The execution, delivery and
performance by Seller of this Agreement and the Closing Documents
to which Seller is or becomes a party and the consummation by
Seller of the transactions contemplated herein and therein:

          (a)  are within Seller's corporate powers, are not in
     contravention of the terms of its articles of incorporation,
     bylaws and other governing documents, if any, as amended to date,
     and, subject to approval of this Agreement and the transactions
     contemplated hereby by the BGCT prior to Closing, have been duly
     authorized by all appropriate corporate and member action;

          (b)  do not conflict with, result in any breach or contravention
     of, or permit the acceleration of the maturity of, any
     liabilities of Seller (other than Excluded Liabilities satisfied
     as of the Closing Date), and do not create or permit the creation
     of any Encumbrance on or affecting any of the Assets;

	(c)  do not violate any Texas law to which Seller or the Assets
     may be subject (including any bulk transfer or similar law),
     other than such violations which would not have a Material
     Adverse Effect; and

	(d)  except as set forth on Schedule 3.2, do not conflict with or
     result in a breach or violation of any material Contract to which
     Seller is a party or by which it is bound (other

				20
<PAGE>

     than Excluded
     Liabilities satisfied as of the Closing Date), other than such
     violations which would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
     3.3. Binding Agreement.  This Agreement and each of the Closing
     Documents to which Seller is or becomes a party are (or upon
     execution will be) valid and legally binding obligations of
     Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with the
     respective terms hereof or thereof, except as enforceability may
     be restricted, limited or delayed by applicable bankruptcy or
     other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and except as
     enforceability may be subject to general principles of equity.

     3.4. Subsidiaries and Third Party Rights.  Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.4, there are no Contracts with or rights of any Person
to acquire, directly or indirectly, any material Assets, or any
interest therein, other than Contracts entered into in the
ordinary course of the Hospital Businesses.  Seller holds no
interest in any Person that conducts a healthcare business other
than the Joint Ventures and the Subsidiaries of Seller identified
on Schedule 3.4.  The Joint Ventures and Laundry Cooperative are
accounted for by Seller as investments and not consolidated with
the financial results of the Hospitals.  The Subsidiaries of
Seller are the Baptist Health System Foundation, Baptist Venture
Corp., BHS Medical Services Corporation, BMHS Healthcare
Corporation and, subject to consummation prior to Closing of the
transaction described in clause (i) of Section 6.10, Memorial
Professional Services, Inc.

     3.5. Legal and Regulatory Compliance.  To Seller's knowledge,
Seller has timely filed all reports, data and other information
required to be filed with Governmental Authorities, where a
failure to file timely would have a Material Adverse Effect.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.5, Seller has not received
written notice from any Governmental Authority of any proceeding
or investigation by Governmental Authorities alleging or based
upon a violation of any Legal Requirements that has not expired
and that would otherwise have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Hospital Businesses.  To Seller's knowledge, Seller has not been
threatened by any Person with any proceeding or investigation by
Governmental Authorities alleging a violation of any Legal
Requirements.  Seller has delivered to Buyer a complete and
genuine copy of (i) any corporate integrity agreement with the
Office of Inspector General of the United States Department of
Health and Human Services or written agreement with such
Governmental Authority to establish or maintain a corporate
integrity policy or program applicable to any of the Hospital
Businesses and (ii) any settlement or other agreement with any
other Governmental Authority, other than participation agreements
with Medicare and Medicaid, that imposes any continuing
obligations on any of the Hospital Businesses or contains
obligations which have not been fully discharged.  To Seller's
knowledge, Seller has fully and timely complied with all of the
terms and conditions thereof, and all certifications, audits and
reports required to be delivered and all documents required to be
retained under agreements with the Office of the Inspector
General described in the foregoing sentence that affect the
Hospital Businesses have been timely delivered and retained.

     3.6. Financial Statements.  Attached as Schedule 3.6 are copies
of the Unaudited Financial Statements.  The Financial Statements
fairly present the financial condition and results of operations
of the Hospital Businesses as of the respective dates thereof and
for the periods therein referred to, all in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, subject, in the case of
unaudited Financial Statements, to normal recurring year-end
adjustments (the effects of which will

				21
<PAGE>

not have a Material
Adverse Effect) and the absence of notes (which, if presented,
would not differ materially from those included in the Audited
Financial Statements); and the Financial Statements reflect the
consistent application of such accounting principles throughout
the periods involved.

     3.7. Operation of the Hospital Businesses.  The Assets constitute
all assets, properties, goodwill and businesses necessary to
operate the Hospital Businesses substantially in the manner in
which they have been conducted by Seller since August 31, 2001,
except (i) as set forth on Schedule 3.7, and (ii) for property,
plant and equipment otherwise sold or disposed of since such date
resulting in gross proceeds not exceeding $750,000 in the
aggregate.  Schedule 3.7 sets forth a list of the ten largest non-
governmental payors of the Hospital Businesses, determined based
on revenues from services provided for the fiscal year ended
August 31, 2001.  To Seller's knowledge, no payor listed on
Schedule 3.7 intends to terminate or materially curtail its
business relationship with or materially reduce reimbursement
rates to the Hospitals.

     3.8. Recent Activities.  Since August 31, 2002 and except as set
forth on Schedule 3.8:

	(a)  No material damage, destruction or loss (whether or not
     covered by insurance) has occurred affecting the Assets;

     Hospital Businesses or agreed to make any bonus that has not been

     transaction outside the ordinary course of the Hospital
     Businesses that would result in a liability or obligation of
     Seller in excess of $75,000; and

	(l)  to Seller's knowledge, no event or circumstance has occurred
     which has had or reasonably could be expected to have a Material
     Adverse Effect.

     3.9. Accounts Receivable; Inventory.

	(a)  The Accounts Receivable, to the extent uncollected, are
     valid and existing and represent monies due for goods sold and
     delivered and services performed in bona fide commercial
     transactions, have been billed or are billable and, except as set
     forth on Schedule 3.9, are not subject to any Encumbrances; to
     Seller's knowledge, except for the application of deposits held
     by the Hospital Businesses, there are no refunds, discounts or
     setoffs payable or assessable with respect to the Accounts
     Receivable not reflected in the Financial Statements.  Since
     August 31, 2000, no Accounts Receivable that have been written
     off have been sold by Seller.

	(b)  All Inventory is carried at cost on a first-in first-out
     basis.  All items of Inventory on hand consist of items of a
     quality usable or saleable in the ordinary course of business,
     except for those items which are obsolete, below standard quality
     or in the process of repair. The quantities of Inventory are at a
     level consistent with the quantities of Inventory maintained in
     the ordinary course of the Hospital Businesses.

     3.10.     Equipment.  Schedule 2.1(b) includes a depreciation
schedule as of the date set forth therein that, to Seller's
knowledge, takes into consideration major items of equipment
associated with, or constituting any part of, the Assets.  To
Seller's knowledge and except as described on Schedule 3.10, all
equipment used in the operations of the Hospital Businesses,
whether reflected in the Financial Statements or otherwise, is

maintenance logs or journals with respect to such major medical

				23

     3.11.     Title to Personal Property.  Seller owns good and valid
title or leasehold interests in all Assets other than the Real
Property, free and clear of any Encumbrances other than the

     3.13.     Environmental Matters.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, this Section 3.13 contains the only
representations or warranties of Seller with respect to
Environmental Laws affecting the Hospital Businesses, and no
other statement or representation or warranty of Seller in any
other document delivered to or received by or on behalf of Buyer
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be deemed to be a representation or warranty
relating to Environmental Laws.

	(a)  To Seller's knowledge, the Hospital Businesses are in
     compliance with all Environmental Laws except where the failure
     to be in compliance would not have a Material Adverse Effect.  To
     Seller's knowledge, the Hospital Businesses have all material
     permits, licenses and approvals which are necessary under
     Environmental Laws for their operation as currently conducted,
     except for such incidental licenses, permits, and other
     authorizations which would be readily obtainable by any qualified
     applicant without undue burden in the event of a lapse.  All
     Governmental Permits required under Environmental Laws that are
     currently owned, held, or possessed by the Hospital Businesses
     are listed in Schedule 3.13.

	(b)  The Hospital Businesses are not currently subject to any
     pending or, to Seller's knowledge, threatened judicial or

     Date.

	(c)  None of the Hospital Businesses is subject to any pending

     Except as set forth in Schedule 3.13, none of the Hospital
     Businesses has reported an unpermitted release pursuant to any
     Environmental Laws and, to Seller's knowledge, no unpermitted
     release of any Materials of Environmental Concern in violation of
     any Environmental Laws has occurred at or affecting the Real

     from Government Authorities or a third party claimant to the

     Seller's knowledge:

	(a)  Seller has the right to use the Intellectual Properties used
     by Seller in the conduct of the Hospital Businesses, and no
     proceedings have been instituted or threatened which challenge
     Seller's right to use the Intellectual Property.

	(b)  Seller has the right to use the Information Systems, and no
     proceedings have been instituted or threatened which challenge
     Seller's use of such software, hardware application programs and
     similar systems.

     3.15.     Insurance.  Schedule 3.15 describes all insurance
arrangements, including self-insurance, in place for the benefit
of the Assets and the conduct of the Hospital Businesses. With
respect to third party insurance, Schedule 3.15 sets forth the
name of each insurer, whether such insurer is an Affiliate of
Seller, and the number, coverage, limits, term and premium for
each policy of insurance purchased or held by Seller covering the
ownership and operation of the Assets and the Hospital
Businesses.  All of such policies are now and until Closing will
remain valid, outstanding, in full force and effect, and
enforceable with no premium arrearages. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.15, since August 31, 1999, Seller has not been denied,
or reduced or requested a reduction in the scope or amount of,
any insurance or indemnity bond coverage with respect to the
ownership or operation of the Assets or the Hospital Businesses.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.15, no insurance carrier has
canceled or reduced, or given notice of its intention to cancel
or reduce, any insurance coverage with respect to the Hospital
Businesses, and, to Seller's knowledge, there exist no grounds to
cancel or avoid any such policies or the coverage provided
thereby.  True and correct copies of all such policies and any
endorsements thereto have been delivered to Buyer.

     3.16.     Permits and Licenses.  Schedule 3.16 contains an
accurate list and summary description of all material licenses,
permits, franchises and certificates of need (including
applications therefor), except for those otherwise identified in
Schedule 3.13, in effect as of the date hereof, owned or held by
Seller relating to the ownership, development or operations of
the Hospital Businesses and the Assets (collectively, the
"Permits"), all of which, to Seller's knowledge, are in full
force and effect.  Each of the Hospitals is duly licensed as an
acute care hospital by the appropriate state agencies, and all
Hospital departments or other Hospital Businesses that are
required to be separately licensed are duly licensed by the
appropriate state agencies and are in compliance in all material
respects with such licensing requirements.  Seller has provided
to Buyer complete and genuine copies of the latest Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations,
HCFA/CMS, Texas Department of Health licensure/survey and/or fire
marshal reports of the Hospital Businesses and plans of
correction or responses thereto.  The Hospitals have taken or are
taking all reasonable steps to correct all material deficiencies
noted therein.

     3.17.     Government Payment Programs; Accreditation.  Each of
the Hospitals has current and valid provider Contracts with the
Government Payment Programs and/or their fiscal intermediaries or
paying agents and, to Seller's knowledge, complies with the
conditions of participation therein except to the extent that a
failure to so comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
To Seller's knowledge, each of the Hospitals is entitled to
receive and is receiving payment under the Government Payment
Programs for services rendered to qualified beneficiaries and is
not subject to

				26
<PAGE>

any withholds or offsets in respect thereof, other
than withholds or offsets which individually or in the aggregate
do not have a Material Adverse Effect.  The Cost Reports were
filed when due for all Cost Report periods through August 31,
1999.  The Cost Reports have been audited and Notices of Program
Reimbursement issued for all Cost Report periods through August
31, 1997.  All amounts shown as due from Seller in the Cost
Reports were remitted with such reports and all amounts shown in
the Notices of Program Reimbursement as due have been paid.
Except to the extent liabilities and contractual adjustments of
Seller under the Government Payment Programs have been properly
reflected and adequately reserved in the Financial Statements, to
Seller's knowledge, Seller has not received or submitted any
claim for payment in excess of the amount provided by law or
applicable Contract and Seller has not received notice of any
dispute or claim by any Governmental Authority, fiscal
intermediary or other Person regarding the Government Payment
Programs, or the Hospitals' participation therein.  Each of the

     Persons having business relations with Seller.

	(a)  Amend or terminate any Assumed Contract, or enter into any
     Contract; provided that Seller may enter into, terminate or amend
     Immaterial Contracts in the ordinary course of the Hospital
     Businesses consistent with past practices or may amend any such
     Assumed Contract to the extent that the principal effect of such
     amendment is to effectuate the assignment and assumption thereof
     pursuant to this Agreement and such amendment does not increase
     the obligations of Buyer following the Closing to any material
     extent or reduce the obligations of the other party or parties
     thereto to any material extent;

	(b)  Make an offer for employment after Closing to any employee
     of the Hospital Businesses who has received an offer of
     employment from Buyer;

     any of the Hospital Businesses, except (i) that bonus payments
     may be made as required by Contracts entered into prior to the
     Effective Date and (ii) in the ordinary course of the Hospital
     Businesses consistent with past practices in accordance with
     existing personnel policies;

	(d)  Create or assume any new Encumbrance upon any of the Assets
     other than (i) the interests of lessors or lessees under

<PAGE>

	(g)  Cancel, forgive, release, discharge or waive any Accounts

	(a)  From the Effective Date until the Closing Date, Seller, to
     the extent legally permissible without waiving any privilege or
     violating any duties of confidentiality to third Persons imposed
     by Contracts or Legal Requirements: (i) will make available to
     Buyer full and complete access to and the right to inspect the
     Assets, books and records of Seller relating to the Hospital
     Businesses during normal business hours; (ii) will use its best
     efforts to provide to Buyer full and complete access to any of

     other data and information regarding the Hospital Businesses as
     Buyer may from time to time reasonably request, without regard to
     where such information may be located to the extent in Seller's
     possession, and with respect to such data not in Seller's
     possession, will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to make such
     data (including auditors' work papers) available to Buyer; and
     (iv) where any such access or information is denied due to duties
     of confidentiality to third Persons imposed by a Contract, Seller
     will give Buyer written notice of the subject matter of each non-
     disclosure, and, at Buyer's reasonable request, make Commercially
     Reasonable Efforts to obtain the waiver of such duty of
     confidentiality by such third Person to allow disclosure of such
     matter to Buyer.

	(b)  Seller will deliver to Buyer complete and genuine copies of:

               (i)  within 20 days following the end of each calendar month
          prior to the Closing Date, the unaudited balance sheet of Seller
          and the related unaudited statements of income and cash flows of
          the Hospital Businesses for each such month

				38
<PAGE>

	  then ended and for the year-to-date then ended, in consolidating
	  and consolidated format,

		(ii) promptly after prepared, any other financial statements or
	  reports prepared prior to Closing by or for management relating
          to the Hospital Businesses, together with any notes thereto, and

		(iii)     promptly after they become available, the Audited
          Financial Statements.

          (c)  From the Effective Date until the Closing Date, Seller shall
     cause the officers and employees of the Hospital Businesses to
     confer on a regular and frequent basis with one or more
     representatives of Buyer at Buyer's request and to answer Buyer's
     questions regarding matters relating to the conduct of the
     Hospital Businesses and the status of transactions contemplated
     by this Agreement.  Seller shall notify Buyer in writing of any
     material changes in the operations or financial condition of the
     Hospital Businesses and of any complaints, investigations,
     hearings or adjudicatory proceedings (or communications
     indicating that the same may be contemplated) of any Person and
     shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of such matters.

     6.4. Alternative Proposals.

	(a)  From the Effective Date until the Closing of the
     transactions contemplated by, or termination of, this Agreement
     and subject to Section 6.4(b), Seller

		(i)  will not, and will direct and use its best efforts to cause
          its officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives
          (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained
          by either of them) not to, initiate, solicit or encourage,
          directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making or
          implementation of any proposal or offer (including any proposal
          or offer to its board of directors) with respect to a merger,
          acquisition, consolidation, business combination or similar
          transaction involving the purchase of or transfer of control over
          all or any significant portion of the Assets or equity or
          membership interests in Seller (any such proposal or offer being
          hereinafter referred to as an "Alternative Proposal"), or engage
          in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential
          information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person
          relating to an Alternative Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any
          effort or attempt to make or implement an Alternative Proposal;

		(ii) will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
          existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons
          conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and it
          will take the necessary steps to inform the individuals or
          entities referred to above of the obligations undertaken in this
          Section; and

				39
<PAGE>

		(iii)     will notify Buyer immediately if any such inquiries
          or proposals are received by, any such information is requested
          from, or any such negotiations or discussions are sought to be
          initiated or continued with, it.

	(b)  Nothing contained in Section 6.4(a) shall prohibit the board
     of trustees, officers or agents of Seller from furnishing
     information to or entering into discussions or negotiations with
     any Person that makes an unsolicited bona fide Alternative
     Proposal; provided that (A) the board of trustees of Seller
     determines in good faith that such action is required for the
     board to comply with its fiduciary duties imposed by non-profit
     corporation law and other law, (B) prior to furnishing such
     information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations
     with, such Person, Seller provides written notice to Buyer to the
     effect that it is furnishing information to, or entering into
     discussions or negotiations with, such Person, and (C) subject to
     any confidentiality agreement with such Person (which Seller
     determined in good faith was required to be executed in order for
     its board to comply with fiduciary duties imposed by law), Seller
     keeps Buyer informed of the status (not the terms) of any
     discussions or negotiations.

	(c)  Nothing in this Section shall:

		(i)  permit Seller to terminate this Agreement except as
          specifically provided in Article 11;

		(ii) permit Seller to enter into any Contract with respect to an
          Alternative Proposal during the term of this Agreement (it being
          agreed that during the term of this Agreement Seller shall not
          enter into any Contract with any Person that provides for or in
          any way facilitates an Alternative Proposal (other than a
          confidentiality agreement in customary form)); or

		(iii)     affect any other obligation of Seller under this
          Agreement.

     6.5. Insurance Ratings.  From the Effective Date until the
Closing Date, Seller will take all actions reasonably requested
by Buyer to enable Buyer, at Buyer's expense, to succeed to the
Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Insurance ratings of
Seller and the Hospital Businesses for insurance purposes;
provided that Seller makes no representation or warranty that
Buyer will be successful in such succession.  Buyer shall not be
obligated to succeed to any such rating, except as it may elect
to do so.

     6.6. Tail Insurance.  On or prior to the Closing Date or except
as otherwise agreed by Buyer at Closing, Seller will purchase and
obtain an extended claims reporting provision without expiration
for primary and excess professional and general liability
insurance policies in force as of the Effective Date, for the
full value of their existing limits of liability for activities
occurring prior to the Closing Date, which shall reasonably
protect the Hospitals and each physician for whom any of the
Hospitals otherwise has an obligation to provide such insurance
consistent with past practice and which are written on a claims
made insuring agreement against insured losses.  To the extent
commercially available, Seller shall obtain quotes for extended
claim endorsements which shall

				40
<PAGE>

name Buyer as an insured
thereunder, give Buyer notice of the cost (if any) of such
endorsements and obtain such endorsements for the benefit of
Buyer at the request of Buyer, provided that Buyer shall
reimburse Seller for the cost of such endorsements.  Buyer shall
cooperate with Seller to evaluate alternative arrangements that
provide substantially the same liability protections to the
Parties as tail insurance, but that are less costly than the
purchase by Seller of tail insurance directly.  If any insurance
described in this Section is provided under a program of self-
insurance, Seller may satisfy the above obligations by
maintaining self-insurance in amounts that provide substantially
the same liability protections to the Parties as would arise
under occurrence-based insurance policies purchased by Seller to
cover acts and omissions prior to Closing of the Hospitals and
each physician who is an employee of the Hospitals or for whom
any of the Hospitals otherwise has an obligation to provide such
insurance consistent with past practice, provided that Seller may
engage, at its option, in a loss portfolio transfer for some or
all of such risks with one or more insurers qualified to sell
insurance to Seller in the State of Texas, in which event Seller
shall obtain quotes for such insurers expressly naming Buyer as a
beneficiary thereof to the extent commercially available, give
Buyer notice of the incremental cost (if any) of having Buyer
named as a beneficiary, and name Buyer as a beneficiary in such
loss portfolio transfer at the request of Buyer, provided that
Buyer shall reimburse Seller for the incremental cost thereof.

     6.7. Consent of Others.  Subject to the obligations of Buyer
under Section 7.1, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
date hereof, and in any event prior to Closing, Seller shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain the consents required
to be obtained by Seller of all necessary Persons and
Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over this
transaction to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereunder, including the Permits listed in Schedule 3.16 that are
assignable by Seller, the contractual rights, licenses,
investments, interests and assets referenced in Section 2.1(g),
(i), (k) and (l) and the assignment and continuation of the
Assumed Contracts.  The foregoing notwithstanding, Buyer shall
use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain any Permits listed
in Schedule 3.16 that are not assignable by Seller, provided that
Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in obtaining such consents so
long as such cooperation is at no material cost to Seller.

     6.8. Seller's Efforts to Close.  Seller shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to satisfy all the conditions precedent set
forth in Articles 9 and 10 to its or to Buyer's obligations under
this Agreement to the extent that Seller's action or inaction can
control or influence the satisfaction of such conditions.

     6.9. Employee Terminations.  At Closing, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer a list as of the Closing Date setting forth the name of
each employee of the Hospital Businesses whose employment was
terminated during the 90 day period ending on the Closing Date
and the reason for such termination and Seller shall not
terminate prior to Closing (except for cause) any employee to
whom Buyer has agreed to offer employment.

     6.10.     Acquisition of the PHO and the Boerne Property;
Synthetic Lease Arrangement.  At or prior to Closing, Seller
shall either (i) acquire Memorial Health Foundation by merger
into BHS and as a result indirectly acquire the 50% interest in
the PHO and the Real Property located in Boerne, Texas owned by
Memorial Professional Services, Inc., or (ii) cause such Persons
to transfer

				41
<PAGE>

and convey such Assets to Buyer at Closing, in
consideration for the forgiveness of indebtedness owed by such
Persons to Seller.  In addition, Seller shall pay off the
indebtedness related to, and obtain the termination of, the
Special Synthetic Lease relating to the Real Property described
on Schedule 6.10 and cause such Real Property to be transferred
and conveyed to Seller.

     6.11.     Texas Airlife.  Prior to Closing, Seller shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain the approval of
University Health System to replace Seller as one of the two
sponsors of Texas Airlife with the right to appoint 50% of Texas
Airlife's Board of Directors (the other sponsor being University
Health System) with Buyer or its Affiliate, as designated by
Buyer; and if such approval is not obtained, Seller will take
Commercially Reasonable Efforts after Closing to cause Texas
Airlife to provide to Buyer substantially the same operating and
economic benefits enjoyed by Seller prior to Closing.

7.0. Covenants and Obligations of Buyer.

     From the Effective Date until the Closing Date and except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, or agreed to in
writing by Seller, Buyer will:

     7.1. Consent of Others.  As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Date, and in any event prior to Closing, Buyer
shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain the Permits,
accreditations, consents and approvals required to be obtained by
Buyer of all necessary Persons and Governmental Authorities
having jurisdiction over this transaction to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereunder, including the Permits
listed in Schedule 3.16 that are not assignable by Seller.  In
that regard, Buyer may, in its reasonable determination, conclude
that in order to obtain such Permits, accreditations, approvals
or assignments, Buyer must enter into a separate agreement or
understanding with the Governmental Authority, or payor, or the
other party to an Assumed Contract, responsible for issuing or
granting a Permit, accreditation, consent or approval.  Such
agreement may require Buyer to assume certain obligations and
liabilities of Seller that are Excluded Liabilities or against
which Seller is to indemnify, or for which Seller is to otherwise
reimburse, Buyer.  Alternatively, Buyer may be required by Legal
Requirement to assume, or be deemed by Legal Requirement to have
assumed, such obligations and liabilities of Seller.  If Buyer
enters into any such agreement or understanding with any such
Person or assumes by Legal Requirement such obligations or
liabilities of Seller, such agreement, understanding or
assumption shall not in any manner whatsoever impair the rights
of Buyer's Indemnified Persons to indemnification against Seller
or the New Foundation, or diminish Seller's indemnity obligations
to Buyer's Indemnified Persons, under this Agreement and shall
under no circumstances be claimed by Seller or the New Foundation
as a defense (whether of waiver, estoppel, consent, operation of
law or otherwise) against Buyer's assertion of any claim under
this Agreement against Seller, and the rights and obligations of
the Parties to each other under this Agreement shall be
determined as if such agreement or understanding with such
Governmental Authority or payor, or the other party to an Assumed
Contract, did not exist or such assumption was not required by
Legal Requirement.  Buyer shall give Seller prior notice of its
intent to enter into, and Seller may participate in negotiating
the terms of, any such agreement or understanding with the
Governmental Authority, or payor, or the other party to an
Assumed Contract, responsible for issuing or granting a Permit,
accreditation, consent or approval.

				42
<PAGE>

     7.2. Buyer's Efforts to Close.  Buyer shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to satisfy all the conditions precedent set
forth in Articles 9 and 10 to its or Seller's obligations under
this Agreement to the extent that Buyer's action or inaction can
control or influence the satisfaction of such conditions.

     7.3. Employee Matters.

	(a)  Subject to the exclusions set forth in this Section and in
     reliance upon the representations and warranties of Seller in
     Sections 3.20 and 3.21, Buyer will provide written offers, or one
     or more of Buyer's Affiliates will provide written offers, to
     employ as of the Closing Date substantially all active employees
     of Seller immediately prior to Closing on substantially the same
     terms and conditions (i.e., salaries, wages, job duties, titles,
     and responsibilities) applicable to such employees on the
     Effective Date.  Buyer will also offer to employ at the Hospitals
     substantially all employees of Seller working at the Hospitals
     who are on family or medical leave, short-term disability or
     other short-term leave immediately prior to Closing, effective
     upon their return to work, on substantially the same terms and
     conditions (i.e., salaries, wages, job duties, titles and
     responsibilities) applicable to such employees prior to going on
     short-term leave.  In addition, Buyer will offer the Hired
     Employees the opportunity to participate in the Buyer Employee
     Benefit Plans described in Section 5.5.  Seller acknowledges that
     all employment offers will be made subject to the satisfactory
     completion by Buyer of its customary employee background checks.
     Employees employed under written Contracts will not be offered
     employment pursuant to this Section, but shall be employed
     pursuant to the terms of the Assumed Contracts, if any, relating
     to such employees.  Any workforce reduction shall be conducted by
     Buyer in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements.

	(b)  Nothing contained in this Section or elsewhere in this
     Agreement shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect in any
     manner the right of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer to terminate
     at will the employment of any Hired Employee (except as otherwise
     provided in Assumed Contracts with such employees), or limit the
     right of Buyer or any Affiliate to apply its existing personnel
     policies and procedures to the Hired Employees.  Nothing
     contained in this Section or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
     deemed to limit or otherwise affect in any manner the right of
     Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer to make changes after Closing to
     the terms and conditions of Employee Benefit Plans offered to the
     Hired Employees so long as such changes apply to all employees
     covered by the affected Employee Benefit Plans.

	(c)  With respect to the Hired Employees and their eligible
     dependents, Buyer will waive any eligibility waiting periods and
     the "pre-existing condition" exclusions under Buyer's applicable
     Employee Welfare Benefit Plan offered to the Hired Employees,
     subject to any eligibility and pre-existing condition limitations
     provided by Seller's Employee Welfare Benefit Plan, as the case
     may be, as of the Closing Date.  Buyer shall give all Hired
     Employees credit for their accumulated and unused vacation, sick
     and personal days, to the extent the same constitute Accrued PTO,
     and for their Unbooked Employee Benefits; such amounts shall not
     be subject to reduction, offset or any other limitation under
     Buyer's vacation, holiday, sick pay or paid time-off policies and
     procedures.  Buyer shall give all

				43
<PAGE>

     Hired Employees credit after
     Closing for their years of service with Seller for the purpose of
     determining how much vacation, holiday and sick pay and severance
     pay the Hired Employees are entitled to under the applicable
     Employee Welfare Benefit Plan of Buyer and for purposes of
     determining eligibility to participate, vesting percentages and
     rates of accrual in the Employee Pension Benefit Plans offered to
     the Hired Employees, subject to any limitations relating to such
     matters provided by Seller's Employee Welfare Benefit Plan, as
     the case may be, as of the Closing Date.  Buyer will not make any
     contributions to Seller's pension plans and will not assume or
     otherwise become liable for (i) Seller's Employee Welfare Plans,
     (ii) obligations under Seller's severance program or severance
     Contracts, (iii) with respect to Hired Employees and their
     beneficiaries who are in a "continuum of care" on the Closing
     Date, payment of any inpatient hospital or sub-acute care
     facility charges for such admission, unless they are enrolled in
     an HMO plan both prior to and after Closing, (iv) long-term
     disability payments to any former employee of Seller who does not
     actively work for Buyer after Closing, or (v) other obligations
     to former or currently retired employees of Seller, including
     unemployment compensation.  A person is in the "continuum of
     care" on the Closing Date if that person (y) is an inpatient of
     any hospital on the Closing Date or (z) is an inpatient at a sub-
     acute care facility (e.g., skilled nursing facility, long term
     care facility or mental health facility) on the Closing Date.
     Buyer will make available group health plan continuation coverage
     required under COBRA to employees of Seller who are eligible for
     COBRA, provided that Seller will reimburse Buyer, with respect to
     COBRA beneficiaries receiving self insured PPO coverage whose
     qualifying events occurred prior to the Closing Date, for any
     excess of PPO claims of such COBRA Beneficiaries paid from
     Buyer's assets and not reimbursed from stop loss insurance over
     the COBRA premiums collected from such COBRA Beneficiaries,
     determined in the aggregate with respect to all such individuals
     at the end of the COBRA period for all such employees.   If Hired
     Employees who are enrolled in an HMO plan prior to the Closing
     Date are in a "continuum of care" on the Closing Date and are not
     enrolled in an HMO plan after the Closing Date, Seller will
     reimburse Buyer for inpatient hospital charges paid in respect of
     such employee until they are no longer in the continuum of care.

          (d)  Buyer will credit each Hired Employee and their eligible
     dependents under the Employee Welfare Benefit Plans offered to
     the Hired Employees with any deductibles, copayments or other
     cost-sharing amounts incurred by the Hired Employee or eligible
     dependent under Seller's Employee Welfare Benefit Plans, as the
     case may be, during the period beginning on the first day of the
     most recent plan year of the applicable Employee Welfare Benefit
     Plan offered by Buyer to the Hired Employees and ending on the
     Closing Date.

          (e)  Between the Effective Date and Closing, Buyer may run
     newspaper advertisements in the name of any of the Hospital
     Businesses to recruit employees for and in the name of any of the
     Hospital Businesses, such employment to commence as of the
     Closing or any time thereafter; provided that should this
     Agreement terminate prior to Closing for any reason, Seller shall
     not be liable for any obligation made by Buyer to such
     prospective employee.

				44
<PAGE>

	(f)  Buyer will provide tuition reimbursement to the Hired
     Employees enrolled in a qualified educational program at Closing,
     for the year in which the Closing occurs, in accordance with and
     subject to the terms and conditions of Seller's tuition
     reimbursement plan.

8.0. Additional Covenants and Obligations

transactions contemplated hereby, and comply promptly with any
requests by the Governmental Authorities for additional
information concerning such transactions, so that (1) the waiting
period specified in the HSR Act will expire as soon as reasonably
possible after the Effective Date and (2) Governmental
Authorities in Texas have been provided all information they have
reasonably requested concerning the transactions contemplated
hereby.  Each of the Parties shall furnish to the other Parties
such information as the other Parties reasonably require to
perform their obligations under the HSR Act or under such Texas
laws and shall exchange drafts of the relevant portions of each
other's report forms or other filings prior to filing.

     8.2. Costs and Expenses.

	(a)  Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement,
     all expenses of the preparation of this Agreement and of the
     purchase of the Assets set forth herein, including counsel,

     disbursements, shall be borne by the respective Party incurring
     such expenses, whether or not such transactions are consummated.

	(b)  Seller shall pay the cost of preparation of the Audited
     Financial Statements other than the Special Audited Financial
     Statements, all sales and use Taxes arising out of the transfer
     of the Assets, State and County real estate transfer Taxes, the
     costs of complying with the Attorney General's process referred
     to in Section 8.5, the cost of Buyer's standard form owner's or
     leasehold title insurance policies described in Section 10.6, and
     the cost of removing Encumbrances that are not Permitted
     Encumbrances.  Buyer shall pay the cost of the preparation of the
     Special Audited Financial Statements, the HSR Act filing fee,
     certificate of exemption filing fees, city real estate transfer
     Taxes, the cost of any title insurance policy endorsements
     requested by Buyer, including extended coverage endorsement, and
     the costs of land title surveys of the Real Property and
     environmental, engineering and other professional studies
     undertaken by Buyer, and any fees related to obtaining any new
     Permits or the assignment or transfer of any existing Permits.

     8.3. Fulfillment of Conditions.  Each Party will execute and
deliver at Closing each Closing Document that such Party is
required by this Agreement to execute and deliver as a condition
to Closing, and will take all commercially reasonable steps
necessary or desirable and proceed diligently and in good faith
to satisfy each other condition to the obligations of the Parties

				45
<PAGE>

contained in this Agreement, to the extent that satisfaction of
such condition is within the control of such Party.

     8.4. Release of Encumbrances.  Seller shall cause all
Encumbrances other than the Permitted Encumbrances to be released
and discharged at or prior to Closing.

     8.5. Texas Attorney General Process for Sales of Non-Profit
Assets to For-Profit Corporations.  Prior to Closing, Seller
shall notify the Attorney General of the State of Texas of the
sale of the Assets proposed herein and comply with the
requirements imposed by said Attorney General in the sale of
assets owned by non-profit corporations to for-profit
corporations (including bearing the cost of any third party
appraisals or valuations requested by the Attorney General).

          Seller shall have determined in good faith on the basis of oral
          or written advice of outside counsel that such action is required
          by its fiduciary obligations under applicable law after
          considering applicable provisions of state non-profit corporation
          law and other law and after giving effect to all concessions, if
          any, which have been offered by Buyer pursuant to clause (ii) of
          this paragraph, and (ii) prior to any such termination as a
          result of such an Alternative Proposal, Seller shall, and shall
          cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Buyer
          to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
          Agreement as would enable Buyer to proceed with the transactions
          contemplated hereby; and

				55

          provided further that, in connection
          with the negotiations covered by clause (ii) of this paragraph,
          the purchase price in the Alternative Proposal shall not be
          deemed to be in excess of Buyer's Purchase Price under this
          Agreement until the purchase price in the Alternative Proposal is
          in excess of the greater of (x) the sum of (A) the Purchase Price
          under this Agreement and (B) the $10,000,000 termination fee set
          forth in Section 11.7(a) and (y) the sum of (A) that amount
          higher than the Purchase Price proposed by Buyer as Buyer's new
          purchase price for the Assets and (B) the $10,000,000 termination
          fee set forth in Section 11.7(a);

               (ix) by Buyer if (A) trading generally shall have been suspended
          or is materially limited on or by the New York Stock Exchange or
          the Nasdaq National Market, or (B) any moratorium on commercial
          banking activities shall have been declared by either Federal or
          New York State authorities and is continuing, or (C) the United
          States shall have declared war in accordance with its
          constitutional processes, or (D) there shall have occurred and be
          continuing any material outbreak or escalation of hostilities or
          other national or international calamity or crisis (other than
          any such hostilities or crises as may exist as of the Effective
          Date) which has materially adversely impaired the procurement by
          Buyer of the proposed senior secured B Term Loans which Buyer
          plans to utilize to fund most of the Cash Portion of the Purchase
          Price, or (E) there shall have occurred and be continuing any
          material disruption of or material adverse change in financial,
          banking or capital market conditions or in the syndication market
          for senior secured B Term Loans in the United States which has
          materially adversely impaired the procurement by Buyer of the
          proposed senior secured B Term Loans which Buyer plans to utilize
          to fund most of the Cash Portion of the Purchase Price; or

		(x)  at any time by Buyer upon written notice to Seller along
          with paying to Seller the termination fee described in Section
          11.7(a).

	(b)  No termination shall be effective pursuant to
     Section 11.5(a)(viii) or Section 11.5(a)(x) unless concurrently
     with such termination, Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, pays
     the applicable termination fee in full in accordance with the
     provisions of Section 11.7.

     11.6.     Termination for Casualty.  If prior to the Closing Date
any part of one or more of the Hospitals is destroyed or damaged
by fire, theft, vandalism or other cause or casualty and, as a
result thereof, either (i) more than $2,000,000 of Assets is
rendered prior to the Closing Date unsuitable for its primary
intended use or (ii) the Hospitals are unable to provide all Core
Services, Buyer may terminate this Agreement in its entirety
without penalty.  Otherwise, the Parties shall consummate the
transactions notwithstanding such destruction or damage, in which
event Seller shall pay, transfer and assign to Buyer at Closing
the proceeds (or the right to receive the proceeds) of, plus any
deductibles or copayments required under, the applicable
insurance policy.

     11.7.     Effect of Termination.

<PAGE>

	(a)  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.5(a),
     other than pursuant to Sections 11.5(a)(iii), (viii) or (x),
     neither Party shall have any claim against the other.  If Seller
     terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.5(a)(viii),
     Seller shall pay to Vanguard in cash a termination fee of
     $10,000,000.  If Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to
     Section 11.5(a)(x), Buyer shall pay to Seller in cash a

     Agreement pursuant to Section 11.5(a)(iii), Buyer's liability to
     Seller for Losses suffered by Seller shall not exceed
     $50,000,000.  The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
     agreements contained in this Section are an integral part of the
     transaction contemplated by the Agreement and constitute
     liquidated damages and not a penalty.  If one Party fails to
     promptly pay to the other any fee due under this Section 11.7,
     the defaulting Party shall pay the costs and expenses (including
     legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action, including
     the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect
     payment, together with interest as provided in Section 17.16 from
     the date such fee was required to be paid.

	(b)  Upon termination of this Agreement, Buyer's right of access
     shall terminate, each Party shall promptly return every document
     furnished it by the other Party (or any Affiliate of such other
     Party) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
     whether obtained before or after execution of this Agreement, and
     all copies thereof, and will destroy all copies of any analyses,
     studies, compilations or other documents prepared by it or its
     representatives to the extent they contain any information with
     respect to the business of the other Parties or their Affiliates,
     and will cause its representatives to whom such documents were
     furnished to comply with the foregoing.

	(c)  This Section 11.7 shall survive any termination of this
     Agreement.

12.0.     Post Closing Covenants of Seller

     12.1.     Termination of Hired Employees.  As of the Closing
Date, all Hired Employees shall cease to be employed by Seller
and cease to accumulate additional benefit accruals in any
Employee Pension Benefit Plan of Seller.  As soon as practicable
after Closing (but in any event prior to December 31 of the year
in which the Closing occurs), Seller shall provide Buyer with all
necessary payroll records for the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs so that Buyer may furnish a Form W-2 to all Hired
Employees disclosing all wages and other compensation paid to
them (and amounts withheld therefrom) by Seller and Buyer in the
calendar year.

     12.2.     Noncompetition.

	(a)  For a period of five years from and after the Closing Date,
     neither Seller nor the Foundation nor the New Foundation shall,
     directly or indirectly, and Seller and the New Foundation shall
     use their respective best efforts to cause their respective
     Affiliates (including the New Foundation) not to, in any
     capacity:

		(i)  own, lease, manage, operate, control, participate in the
          management or control of, be employed by, or maintain or continue
          any interest whatsoever in any

				57
<page>

          hospital, or in any other facility
          that provides outpatient surgery, diagnostic imaging, renal
          dialysis, radiation therapy, primary care, urgent care, cardiac
          catherization or endoscopy services within a 25-mile radius of
          each of the Hospitals, which are in direct competition with the
          Hospital Businesses; or

		(ii) employ or solicit the employment of any Hired Employee
          unless (X) such employee resigns voluntarily (without any
          solicitation from Seller, the Foundation or the New Foundation or
          any of their Affiliates), (Y) Buyer consents in writing to such
          employment or solicitation, or (Z) such employee is terminated by
          Buyer after the Closing Date; or

		(iii)     Take any affirmative act with the sole intent of
          causing any Person (including any physician employee or medical
          staff member) to terminate any Contract for the provision or
          arrangement of health care services from any of the Hospitals.

          (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing:

		(i)  Seller, the Foundation and the New Foundation, or any
          successor to any of the foregoing, shall be permitted at any time
          and from time to time to engage in the health care businesses or
          to make grants to fund the health care businesses described on
          Schedule 12.2;

		(ii) Seller may continue to hold its equity interest in Buyer,
          which the parties acknowledge is not an Affiliate of Seller
          subject to the limitations of this Section; and

		(iii)     Seller, the Foundation and the New Foundation may
          advertise generally for employment opportunities and issue other
          notices of employment opportunities to the public at large and
          employ Hired Employees who accept offers of employment pursuant
          to such general advertisements and public notices.

          (c)  Seller acknowledges that any remedy at law for any breach of
     this Section would be inadequate and consent to the granting by
     any court of an injunction or other equitable relief, without the
     necessity of actual monetary loss being proved, in order that a
     breach or threatened breach of this Section may be effectively
     enjoined.

     12.3.     Change of Corporate Names.  Promptly after Closing,
Seller shall change and cause its Affiliates (other than the
Foundation and the New Foundation) to change their corporate
names to names not including "Baptist Hospital", "Baptist Health
System," "Baptist Medical Center" or any variation of the
foregoing related to or suggesting activities falling within the
sphere of activities restricted under Section 12.2, provided that
if Seller merges or consolidates with BCFS or any other BGCT-
affiliated entity, such entity may change its name to "Baptist
Health and Family Services" or another name substantially similar
thereto containing the words "Baptist" and "Health".

				58
<PAGE>

     12.4.     Seller's Cost Reports.  Seller will prepare and timely
file or cause to be prepared and timely filed all Cost Reports
required to be filed after Closing for periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date, including the terminating Cost Report
required as a result of the consummation of the transactions
described herein.  The Purchase Price shall be allocated in the
terminating Cost Report in a manner consistent with the
allocation for Tax purposes described in Section 2.7.  Buyer will
forward to Seller any and all correspondence, remittances and
demands relating to Seller's Cost Reports within five business
days after receipt by Buyer.  Seller shall retain all rights to
Seller's Cost Reports, including any payables resulting from or
reserves relating to the Cost Reports and the right to appeal any
Medicare determinations relating to the Cost Reports.

     12.5.     Further Assurances.  At any time and from time to time
at and after the Closing, upon request of Buyer, Seller shall do,
execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be done, executed,
acknowledged and delivered, such further acts, deeds,
assignments, transfers, conveyances, powers of attorney,
confirmations and assurances as Buyer may reasonably request to
more effectively convey, assign and transfer to and vest in Buyer
full legal right, title and interest in and actual possession of
the Assets and the Hospital Businesses, and to generally carry
out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.  Seller also shall
furnish Buyer with such information and documents in its
possession or under its control, or which Seller can execute or
cause to be executed, as will enable Buyer to prosecute any and
all petitions, applications, claims and demands relating to or
constituting a part of the Assets and Hospital Businesses.

     12.6.     Scholarships.  Seller or the New Foundation shall for a
period of at least ten years following the Closing continue to
provide, and will cause its Affiliates to provide, scholarships
and financial support at the Institute of Health Education to

     12.7.     Lease of Seller's Employee Benefit Plans.  At the
request of Buyer, Seller will cover the Hired Employees under any
or all of Seller's Employee Benefit Plans from the Closing Date

Seller for all of Seller's direct out-of-pocket costs of such
leased Employee Benefit Plans and (ii) Buyer's request for such
lease must be made to Seller a reasonable time prior to Closing.

13.0.     Post-Closing Covenants of Buyer.

     13.1.     General Partner Board of Directors; Hospital Advisory
Board.

	(a)  The Board of Directors of the General Partner shall be
     comprised of seven members, four of whom shall be nominated by a
     subsidiary of Vanguard and three of whom shall be nominated by
     Seller or the New Foundation, and each of the shareholders of the
     General Partner shall execute a consent, or vote its shares in
     the General Partner at any annual or special meeting of
     shareholders where action with respect to the election of
     directors is to be taken, so as to give effect to the provisions
     of this Section 13.1.  Either such shareholder may revoke at any
     time the nomination of a particular individual nominated by it.

				59
<PAGE>

     If, as a result of death, disability, retirement, resignation,
     removal or otherwise, there shall exist any vacancy on the Board
     of Directors of General Partner, the shareholder entitled under
     this Section 13.1 to nominate such individual whose death,
     disability, retirement, resignation or removal resulted in such
     vacancy may nominate another individual to fill such capacity and
     serve as a director.  If, at any time, a shareholder of the
     General Partner is then entitled to vote for the removal of
     directors of the General Partner, it will not vote any of its
     shares in favor of the removal of any director who shall have
     been nominated pursuant to this Section 13.1 unless the
     shareholder entitled to nominate such director shall have
     consented to such removal in writing.  The provisions of this
     paragraph shall be merged into the Shareholders' Agreement upon
     Closing.

	(b)  As soon as practicable following the Closing, Buyer will
     appoint and maintain one or more advisory boards for the
     Hospitals composed of the Hospital's Chief Executive Officer and
     equal numbers of physicians on the Hospital's medical staff and
     community representatives (the "Advisory Board"), in accordance
     with Buyer's model bylaws.  Subject to applicable Legal
     Requirements, the Advisory Board will advise the Hospital on
     medical staff credentialing, quality assurance and accreditation,
     in accordance with Buyer's model bylaws.  In its advisory
     capacity, the Advisory Board shall also review and advise Buyer
     on management's recommended capital budgets for the Hospital.
     The Advisory Board will be composed of between five and 15
     members appointed for terms of three years on a staggered basis
     to provide continuity.  The composition of the initial Advisory
     Board shall be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller on or prior to the
     Closing Date and Seller or the New Foundation may nominate
     candidates for 50% of the seats of each Advisory Board up for
     selection in each year thereafter.  The provisions of this paragraph
     shall be merged into the Shareholders' Agreement upon Closing.

     13.2.     Indigent and Low Income Care.  Buyer acknowledges that
the Hospitals have historically provided significant levels of
care for indigent and low-income patients and have also provided
care through a variety of community-based health programs.
Subject to changes in Legal Requirements or governmental
guidelines or policies (such as implementation of universal
healthcare coverage), Buyer will maintain and adhere to the
Hospitals' current policy on charity care, a copy of which is
attached as Exhibit F, and for the first seven years after
Closing will continue to provide not less than $12,300,000 of
charity care annually to indigent and low-income patients,
provided that on each of the first six anniversaries of the
Closing Date, the annual dollar amount of charity care to be
provided by Buyer pursuant to this Section shall be subject to
adjustment as provided in Schedule 13.2.  Within 120 days after
each of the first seven anniversaries of the Closing Date, Buyer
will provide Seller or the New Foundation with an annual report
of its compliance with the charity care commitment described in
this Section in a form reasonably acceptable to Seller or the New
Foundation, as the case may be.  Seller acknowledges that the
dollar amount of charity care may vary as a result of a number of
factors, including changes in payor mix, local unemployment
figures and eligibility requirements for State or Federal health
benefit programs.  If Buyer fails to provide at least the dollar
amount of charity care required by this Section in any period
covered by the annual report, Buyer shall set forth in the annual
report the reasons for such noncompliance and the Parties shall
consult with each other in good faith to determine what, if any,
actions Buyer may take to reasonably satisfy the Seller or the
New Foundation, as the case may be, that Buyer is providing
sufficient levels

				60
<PAGE>

of charity care to indigent and low-income patients.  Upon request of
Seller or the New Foundation at any time after the sixth anniversary of
the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller or the New Foundation, as the case
may be, shall negotiate in good faith to determine whether Buyer should
extend its commitment to provide specified dollar amounts of charity care
and, if so, the amount and period of the extended commitment.

     13.3.     Commitments to Maintain the Hospitals and Provide Core
Services.

	(a)  For seven years from the Closing Date and unless otherwise
     agreed by Seller or the New Foundation, Buyer shall maintain each
     of the Hospitals as a general acute care hospital licensed in the
     State of Texas and accredited by the Joint Commission on
     Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.

	(b)  For seven years from the Closing Date and unless otherwise
     agreed by Seller or the New Foundation, Buyer shall provide at
     the Hospitals, at a minimum those services described on Schedule
     13.3 (the "Core Services").

     13.4.     Capital Expenditures.  Seller and Buyer have jointly
developed preliminary short and long-term capital plans and
strategic initiatives designed to meet projected service and
facility needs and reaffirm their commitments to the stated goals
and objectives of such plans and initiatives.  Seller and Buyer
shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to update the
preliminary capital plan prior to the Closing with a more
definitive capital plan providing for agreed future capital
expenditures for the Hospital Businesses.  To such end, Buyer
will expend or commit in a binding Contract to expend (or cause
or permit its Affiliates or third parties to expend or commit in
a binding Contract to expend) not less than $200,000,000 for
capital expenditures in and around the San Antonio metropolitan
area during the first six years after Closing, $75,000,000 of
which Buyer will expend or commit in a binding Contract to expend
(or cause or permit its Affiliates or third parties to expend or
commit in a binding Contract to expend) during the first two
years after Closing; provided that the performance of any such
binding commitment to expend capital shall occur not later than
12 months following the end of such two-year period or six-year
period, as the case may be.  If Buyer, its Affiliates and such
third parties do not spend or commit to spend the full
$75,000,000 within the two-year period or the full $200,000,000
within the six-year period, Buyer shall pay to Seller, the New
Foundation or its assignee upon demand the balance in cash,
provided that if Seller terminates the License Agreement pursuant
to its right to do so under Section 8(c) of the License
Agreement, Buyer shall not be obligated to pay the balance in
cash, but, in addition to any other rights or remedies available
to Seller under law, Seller may seek specific performance of
Buyer's capital expenditure commitment hereunder.  Permitted Life
Safety Repairs and Special Capital Expenditures which are added
to the calculation of the Purchase Price in Section 2.5(a) shall
count towards Buyer meeting the capital expenditure covenants set
forth in this Section 13.4.

     13.5.     Retention of Medical Staff.  Buyer shall permit all
members of the Hospitals' medical staff, whether active,
honorary, temporary or otherwise, to retain their current medical
staff appointments until the expiration of their current terms
or, if earlier, two years after Closing. The foregoing will not
limit the ability of Buyer's board of directors, the Hospital's
Advisory Board or

				61
<PAGE>

the Hospital's medical executive committee to suspend medical staff
appointment or clinical privileges in accordance with the terms and
provisions of the medical staff bylaws.

     13.6.     Christ-Centered Delivery System.  In its conduct of the
Hospital Businesses, Buyer will establish and support the
recommendations of a "Ministry and Mission Committee", comprised
of members nominated by Seller or the BGCT, to preserve and
maintain the Baptist mission and Christ-centered approach that
Seller has used historically in the conduct of the Hospital
Businesses and to oversee pastoral care at the Hospitals.  Buyer
will employ a Vice President of Ministries, at fair market
compensation, to oversee mission, vision and values integration
and will maintain indefinitely chapels in all of the Hospitals
and enhance the pastoral care and clinical pastoral education
programs of the Hospitals in conjunction with the Committee. The
Ministry and Mission Committee will recommend to management the
candidate for appointment to the Vice President of Ministries.
Buyer will maintain Seller's policy on therapeutic abortion and
sterilization.  Buyer will work with Seller and the BGCT to
define the scope and mission of pastoral care programs at the
Hospital Businesses after the Closing.

     13.7.     Institute of Health Education.  For not less than ten
years after Closing, Buyer will continue to operate the Institute
of Health Education's Schools of Professional Nursing, Surgical
Technology, Medical Imaging and Vocational Nursing in
substantially the same manner and with substantially the same
financing commitments as Seller operated and financed the
Institute of Health Education as of the Effective Date (or with
such expanded or improved facilities, faculty and staff,
curriculum or financing commitments as Buyer may determine).

     13.8.     Post Closing Assistance to Seller.  Notwithstanding any
of the other provisions of this Agreement, at all times after
Closing upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours,
Buyer will make its records available to Seller in a timely
manner and cooperate with and assist Seller in a timely manner
with the following:

	(a)  The preparation and filing by Seller of Seller's Cost
     Reports as required by Section 12.4;

	(b)  The preparation and filing by Seller of W-2s not filed by
     Buyer pursuant to Section 12.1 and other Tax Returns of Seller;

	(c)  Defending any audits or prosecuting any appeals with regard
     to Seller's Cost Reports; and

	(d)  Paying Excluded Liabilities and utilizing Excluded Assets.

For 12 months after the Closing Date, Buyer will comply with the
provisions of this Section 13.8 at no cost to Seller other than
out-of-pocket expenses.  From and after the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for its actual
reasonable costs of complying with this Section 13.8.  Buyer
shall provide such information, cooperation and assistance
without warranty of any kind to Seller, including a warranty
about the reliability of the contents of such information.

				62
<PAGE>

     13.9.     No Sale of Hospitals.   For seven years after the
Closing Date and without the consent of Seller or the New
Foundation, Buyer shall not sell or otherwise transfer all or
substantially all of the Assets constituting one or more of the
Hospitals to any Person, other than a transfer to a Permitted Transferee.
Nothing in this Section shall limit or impair the ability of Buyer to
operate and conduct the business of the Hospitals as Buyer sees fit in
its sole discretion, subject to its obligations in this Agreement.

     13.10.    Termination of Post-Closing Covenants.  If Seller
terminates the License Agreement pursuant to its right to do so
under Section 8(c) of the License Agreement during the first two
years of the term of the License Agreement, Buyer's covenants and
agreements in this Article 13 shall terminate and be of no
further force or effect, except that Buyer's covenants and
agreements in Sections 13.4 and 13.8 shall survive such
termination.  If Seller terminates the License Agreement pursuant
to its right to do so under Section 8(c) of the License Agreement
after the first two years of the term of the License Agreement,
Buyer's covenants and agreements in this Article 13 shall
terminate and be of no further force or effect, except that
Buyer's covenants and agreements in Sections 13.3(a), 13.4 and
13.8 shall survive such termination.  If Seller terminates the
License Agreement for any other reason, Buyer's covenants and
agreements in this Article 13 shall survive such termination.

     13.11.    Future Local Operations.  Buyer and Vanguard will develop
any additional hospitals or healthcare facilities which they may from time
to time determine to develop within Bexar County, Texas through the Buyer
and in accordance with the provisions of the Shareholders' Agreement and
the License Agreement, to the extent such agreements are then in effect.

14.0.     Other Post-Closing Agreements

     14.1.     Post-Closing Maintenance of and Access to Information.

	(a)  The Parties acknowledge that after Closing each Party may
     need access to information and documents (regardless of medium)
     in the control or possession of another Party for the purposes of
     concluding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
     preparing Tax Returns or conducting Tax audits, obtaining
     insurance, complying with the Government Payment Programs and
     other Legal Requirements, and prosecuting or defending third
     party claims.  Accordingly, each Party shall keep, preserve and
     maintain in the ordinary course of business, and as required by
     Legal Requirements and relevant insurance carriers, all books,
     records (including patient medical records), documents, databases
     and other information (regardless of medium) in the possession or
     control of such Party and relevant to the foregoing purposes at
     least until the expiration of any applicable statute of
     limitations or extensions thereof.  Thereafter, each Party shall
     notify the other Parties, and offer to the other Parties
     reasonable access to such documents, prior to the destruction
     thereof.

	(b)  Each Party shall cooperate fully with, and make available
     for inspection and copying by, the other Party, its employees,
     agents, counsel and accountants and/or Governmental Authorities,
     upon written request and at the expense of the requesting Party,
     such books, records, documents and other information to the
     extent reasonably necessary to

				63
<PAGE>

     facilitate the foregoing purposes. In addition, each Party shall
     cooperate with, and shall permit and use its best efforts to cause
     its former and present directors, officers and employees to cooperate
     with, the other Party on and after Closing in furnishing information,
     evidence, testimony and other assistance in connection with any action,
     proceeding, arrangement or dispute of any nature with respect to
     the subject matters of this Agreement.

	(c)  Buyer shall promptly forward to Seller all bills, notices,
     correspondence, claims or actions relating to any Excluded Asset
     or Excluded Liability and will not pay Excluded Liabilities and
     then request reimbursement from Seller therefor.

	(d)  Upon Buyer's receipt of appropriate consents and
     authorizations, Seller or its assignee shall be entitled to
     remove from the Hospital Businesses, at their sole risk and
     expense, any patient or other records that relate to events or
     periods prior to Closing for purposes of pending claims or
     litigation involving matters to which such records refer, as
     certified in writing prior to removal by counsel retained by
     Seller in connection with such litigation.  Any records so
     removed from the Hospitals shall be promptly returned to Buyer
     following their use by Seller.

	(e)  The exercise by any Party of any right of access granted
     herein shall not materially interfere with the business
     operations of the other Party.

     14.2.     Transition Services and Patients.  If Buyer receives
any Cost Report settlement amounts from the Government Payment
Programs for discharges occurring prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer shall promptly tender such amounts to Seller.  If Seller
receives any Cost Report settlement amounts from the Government
Payment Programs for discharges occurring on or after the Closing
Date, Seller shall promptly tender such amounts to Buyer.  Each
Party shall be entitled to receive from the Government Payment
Programs and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas Cost Report
settlements (including capital costs, indirect medical education
and disproportionate share) for those patients discharged by a
Party at the time such Party owned the Hospitals based upon the
Cost Report filed by such Party.

15.0.     Indemnification

     15.1.     Indemnification by Seller.  Subject to and to the
extent provided in this Article, from and after the Closing,
Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer's
Indemnified Persons, and each of them, from and against any
Losses incurred or suffered by Buyer's Indemnified Persons,
directly or indirectly, as a result of or arising from:

	(a)  Any false or incorrect representation or warranty made by
     Seller in this Agreement or by the New Foundation in the Joinder
     Agreement, provided that in determining whether there has been
     any such false or incorrect representation or warranty, any
     qualification as to materiality included in any representation or
     warranty shall not be taken into account;

				64
<PAGE>

	(b)  The nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other
     obligation of Seller or the New Foundation set forth in this
     Agreement or in any other agreement or instrument delivered by
     Seller or the New Foundation pursuant to this Agreement, except
     as may be waived by Buyer; and

	(c)  The Excluded Liabilities.

     15.2.     Seller's Limitations.



	(a)  In no event shall Seller's indemnification obligations under
     Section 15.1(a) exceed $100,000,000.

	(b)  Seller shall not be required to make any indemnification
     payment pursuant to Section 15.1(a) unless the aggregate of all
     amounts for which indemnity payable by Seller exceeds $750,000
     (the "Basket Amount"), and in such event, Seller shall be
     responsible for only the amount in excess of the Basket Amount;
     provided that there shall be no minimum Loss requirement, and
     liability of Seller shall arise from and after $1.00 of Losses,
     in respect of Losses resulting from Seller's intentional
     misrepresentation or fraud.

	(c)  The liability of Seller with respect to any claim for
     indemnification by any Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 15.2
     shall be offset dollar-for-dollar by (i) any insurance proceeds
     received by Buyer after the Closing Date in respect of the Losses
     involved, and (ii) any other recovery made by Buyer from any
     third-party on account of the Losses involved.

	(d)  Seller shall have no liability under Section 15.1(a) if, at
     or before the Closing Date, Vanguard or Buyer had actual
     knowledge of a false or incorrect representation or warranty of
     Seller or the New Foundation (other than as a result of
     disclosure by Seller or the New Foundation) and did not inform
     one of the Persons listed on Schedule 1.2(g)(i) of such
     knowledge.

     15.3.     Indemnification by Vanguard and Buyer.  Subject to and
to the extent provided in this Article, from and after the
Closing Date, Vanguard and Buyer shall each indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Seller's Indemnified Persons, and each of them,
from and against any Losses incurred or suffered by Seller's
Indemnified Persons, directly or indirectly, as a result of or
arising from:

	(a)  Any false or incorrect representation or warranty made by
     Vanguard or Buyer, provided that in determining whether there has
     been any such false or incorrect representation or warranty, any
     qualification as to materiality included in any representation or
     warranty shall not be taken into account;

	(b)  The nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other
     obligation of Vanguard or Buyer set forth in this Agreement or in
     any other agreement or instrument delivered by Vanguard or Buyer
     pursuant to this Agreement, except as may be waived by Seller;

				65
<PAGE>

	(c)  The Assumed Liabilities; and

	(d)  Any liability or claim of Seller arising under the WARN Act
     as a result of Buyer's termination after Closing of any employee

     to Section 7.3.

     15.4.     Vanguard's and Buyer's Limitations.

	(b)  Buyer shall not be required to make any indemnification
     payment pursuant to Section 15.3(a) unless the aggregate of all
     amounts for which indemnity payable by Buyer exceeds the Basket
     Amount and in such event, Buyer shall be responsible for only the
     amount in excess of the Basket Amount; provided that there shall
     be no minimum Loss requirement, and liability of Buyer shall
     arise from and after $1.00 of Losses, in respect of Losses
     resulting from Buyer's intentional misrepresentation or fraud.

	(c)  The liability of Buyer with respect to any claim for
     indemnification by any Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 15.4
     shall be offset dollar-for-dollar by (i) any insurance proceeds
     received by Seller or the New Foundation after the Closing Date
     in respect of the Losses involved, and (ii) any other recovery
     made by Seller or the New Foundation from any third-party on
     account of the Losses involved.

	(d)  Vanguard and Buyer shall have no liability under Section
     15.3(a) if, at or before the Closing Date, Seller or the New
     Foundation had actual knowledge of a false or incorrect
     representation or warranty of Vanguard or Buyer (other than as a
     result of disclosure by Vanguard or Buyer) and did not inform one
     of the Persons listed on Schedule 1.2(g)(ii) of such knowledge.

     15.5.     Notice and Procedure.  All claims for indemnification
by any Indemnified Party against an Indemnifying Party under this
Article shall be asserted and resolved as provided in the
following provisions of this Article 15

     15.6.     Notice and Control of Litigation.  If any claim or
liability for which an Indemnifying Party would be liable for
Losses to an Indemnified Party is asserted in writing by a Person
other than any Buyer's Indemnified Persons or Seller's
Indemnified Persons, the Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of the same within 30 days after
receipt of such written assertion of a claim or liability.
Should the Indemnified Party fail to notify the Indemnifying
Party in the time required above, the Indemnifying Party shall be
relieved of its obligations pursuant to this Article to the
extent such failure to notify in the time required above
materially adversely affects the Indemnifying Party's ability to
defend such matter.  If the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party within 30 days after notice of such claim that
the Indemnifying Party will defend the Indemnified Party against
the claim, the Indemnifying Party shall, at its sole cost and
risk, defend

				66
<PAGE>

the claim and control the defense, settlement and
prosecution of any litigation.  If within 30 days after notice of
such claim the Indemnifying Party either notifies the Indemnified
Party that the Indemnifying Party disputes its obligations of
indemnity with respect to the claim or fails to notify the
Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party will defend the
claim, or if the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified
Party within such 30 days that the Indemnifying Party will defend
the Indemnified Party against the claim but fails thereafter to
diligently prosecute or settle the claim, the Indemnified Party
will have the right (but not the obligation) to undertake the
defense, compromise or settlement of such claim at the cost and
risk of the Indemnifying Party.  Anything in this
Section notwithstanding, (i) if there is a reasonable probability
that a claim may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified
Party other than as a result of money damages or other money
payments, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own
cost and expense, to defend, compromise and settle such claim,
(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any claim
or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant to the
Indemnified Party a release from all liability in respect to such
claim, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party may not assume the
defense of the claim on behalf of the Indemnified Party if (1)
the Persons against whom the claim is made, or any impleaded
Persons, include both the Indemnifying Party and any Indemnified
Party, and (2) representation of both such Persons by the same
counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them, in which case any Indemnified
Party shall have the right to defend the claim on its own behalf
and to employ counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.
All Parties agree to cooperate fully as necessary in the defense
of such matters (including making any counterclaim or cross-claim
against any Person other than another Party).

     15.7.     Notice of Claim.  If an Indemnified Party has a claim
against any Indemnifying Party that is not described in Section
15.6, the Indemnified Party shall deliver a notice with
reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party describing the
claim.  Should the Indemnified Party fail to notify the
Indemnifying Party within the time frame required above, the
indemnity with respect to the subject matter of the required
notice shall be limited to the damages that would have
nonetheless resulted absent the Indemnified Party's failure to
notify the Indemnifying Party in the time required above after
taking into account such actions as could have been taken by the
Indemnifying Party had it received timely notice from the
Indemnified Party.

     15.8.     Mixed Claims.  Notice of any claim composed in part of
third party claims and claims that are not third party claims may
be given pursuant to either Section 15.6 or 15.7, and the giving
of a notice under Section 15.6 when a notice is properly due
under Section 15.7, or the giving of a notice under Section 15.7
when a notice is properly due under Section 15.6, shall not
impair the Indemnified Party's rights hereunder except to the
extent that an Indemnifying Party has been irreparably prejudiced
thereby.

     15.9.     Presumption of Liability. If the Indemnifying Party
either fails to notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days
following its receipt of notice of the claim that the
Indemnifying Party disputes its obligations of indemnity with
respect to a claim or assumes the defense of a claim, the claim
will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying
Party.

				67
<PAGE>

     15.10.    Disputed Claims.   If the Indemnifying Party timely
notifies the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party
disputes its obligations of indemnity with respect to the claim,
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed
promptly and in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such
dispute within 60 days following receipt of the notice and, if
such dispute is not resolved through negotiations during such 60-
day period, it shall be resolved pursuant to the provisions of
Article 16.

     15.11.    Payment of Losses.  The Indemnifying Party shall pay
the amount of any Losses to the Indemnified Party within 30 days
after notice of the claim is given or on such later date (i) in
the case of a claim described in Section 15.6 that the
Indemnified Party suffers Losses, or (ii) in the case of a claim
described in Section 15.7, promptly after the Indemnified Party
suffers Losses in respect of the claim.  In the event the
Indemnified Party is not paid in full for its claim in a timely
manner after the Indemnifying Party's obligation to indemnify and
the amount thereof has been determined, the amount due shall bear
interest from the date that the Indemnifying Party suffered
Losses in respect of the claim until paid at the interest rate
provided in Section 17.16.

     15.12.    Limitation Period.  No claim pursuant to this Article
15 may be asserted under this Agreement unless the Party making
the claim gives the Party against whom the claim is to be made
notice of such claim before the end of the applicable survival
period (as hereinafter defined), provided that such claim shall
survive the expiration of the survival period if notice thereof,
as required hereby, was previously given.

     15.13.    Survival of Representations; Indemnity Periods.
Notwithstanding any right of Buyer (whether or not exercised) to
investigate the Hospital Businesses or any right of any Party
(whether or not exercised) to investigate the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the other Party contained in
this Agreement, each of Seller and the New Foundation has, on the
one hand, and Buyer and Vanguard have, on the other hand, the
right to rely fully upon the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the other contained in this Agreement
as set forth in this Section.  The representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in this Agreement made by the Parties
will survive the Closing (a) indefinitely with respect to matters
covered by Sections 2.4, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17.13 and
18; (b) until the sooner of 60 days after the expiration of all
applicable periods of statutes of limitations (including all
periods of extension, whether automatic or permissive) or three
years with respect to matters covered by Sections 3.5, 3.13,
3.17, 3.22, 3.23, 3.26, 3.27, 3.28, 4.4, 5.4, 5.7, 5.11, 5.13,
5.14 and 5.15; and (c) until the second anniversary of the
Closing Date in the case of all other representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements, except that:

		(i)  any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that
          would otherwise terminate in accordance with this clause (b) or
          (c) above shall survive, if notice shall have been given pursuant
          to Section 15.7 on or prior to such termination date, until the
          related claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise
          resolved as provided in this Article,

		(ii) in the event of intentional misrepresentation or fraud in
          the making of any representation or warranty, all representations
          and warranties that are the subject of the intentional
          misrepresentation or fraud shall survive until the expiration of
          all

				68
<PAGE>

	  applicable statutes of limitations (including all periods of
          extension, whether automatic or permissive) with respect to
          matters covered thereby, and

		(iii)     rights to indemnification under this Article will
          survive until any claims brought hereunder shall have been
          satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided herein.

16.0.     Alternate Dispute Resolution

     16.1.     Agreement to Use the Procedure.  In the event of a
dispute between the Parties arising out of or related to this
Agreement, the Parties shall utilize the procedures specified in
this Article except (i) when otherwise modified by written
agreement of the Parties at the time or after such time the
dispute arises; (ii) in connection with disputes relating to the
Post-Closing Adjustments, in which event the provisions of
Section 2.5 shall be utilized; (iii) any dispute relating to the
exercise of a right to terminate the Agreement, (iv) any dispute
arising out of a third party lawsuit, (e.g., a potential cross-
claim), notwithstanding that the dispute otherwise arises under
the Agreement, and (v) when otherwise expressly provided
elsewhere in this Agreement.

     16.2.     Initiation of the Procedure.  A Party seeking to
utilize these procedures (the "Initiating Party") shall give
written notice to the other Party or Parties, describing briefly
the nature of the dispute and its claim and identifying an
individual with authority to settle the dispute on its behalf.
The Party receiving such notice (the "Responding Party") shall
have ten days within which to designate, in a written notice
given to the Initiating Party, an individual with authority to
settle the dispute on its behalf.  The individuals so designated
shall be known as the "Authorized Individuals."

     16.3.     Unassisted Settlement.  The Authorized Individuals
shall make such investigations as they deem appropriate and
promptly thereafter (but in no event later than 15 days from the
date of designation of the Responding Party's Authorized
Individual) shall commence discussions concerning resolution of
the dispute.  If the dispute has not been resolved within 30 days
from the commencement of discussions (such 30th day being the
"Submission Date"), it shall be submitted to alternative dispute
resolution (the "ADR") as provided below.

     16.4.     Selection of the Neutral.  The Parties shall have ten
days from the Submission Date to select a mutually acceptable
Person who is not an Affiliate or employee of any Party to
resolve the dispute (the "Neutral").  If no Neutral has been
selected within such time, any Party to the dispute may request
that the American Arbitration Association, the Center for Public
Resources, or another mutually agreed-upon provider of neutral
dispute resolution services, supply within ten days a list of
potential Neutrals with qualifications specified by the Parties.
Within five days after receipt of the list, the Parties shall
independently rank the proposed candidates, simultaneously
exchange rankings and select as the Neutral the individual
receiving the highest combined ranking who is available to serve.

     16.5.     Time and Place for the ADR.  In consultation with the
Neutral, the Parties shall promptly designate a mutually
convenient time and place for the ADR (and unless circumstances
require otherwise, such time shall be no later than 60 days after
selection of the Neutral).

				69
<PAGE>

     16.6.     Exchange of Information.  In the event any Party has a
substantial need for information in the possession of the other
Party in order to prepare for the ADR, the Parties shall attempt
in good faith to agree on procedures for the expeditious exchange
of such information, with the help of the Neutral if necessary.

     16.7.     Summary of Views.  One week prior to the first
scheduled session of the ADR, each Party shall deliver to the
Neutral and to the other Party a concise written summary of its
views on the matter in dispute, such summary not to exceed ten
pages in length.

     16.8.     Staffing the ADR.  In the ADR, each Party shall be
represented by the Authorized Individual and by up to two counsel
(who may be in house counsel).  In addition, each Party may bring
such other Persons (the maximum number of which shall be agreed
upon by the Parties in advance) as may be needed to respond to
questions, contribute information and participate in the
negotiations, with the assistance of the Neutral, if necessary.

     16.9.     Conduct of the ADR.  The Parties, in consultation with
the Neutral, will agree upon a format for the meetings designed
to assure that the Neutral and the Authorized Individuals have an
opportunity to hear an oral presentation of each Party's views on
the matter in dispute, and that the Authorized Individuals
attempt to negotiate a resolution of the matter in dispute, with
or without the assistance of counsel or others, but with the
assistance of the Neutral.  To this end, the Neutral is
authorized to conduct both joint meetings and separate private
caucuses with the Parties.  The Neutral will keep confidential
all information learned in private caucus with either Party
unless specifically authorized by such Party to make disclosure
of the information to the other Party.

     16.10.    The Neutral's Views.  The Neutral shall (a) unless
requested not to do so by the Parties, provide his opinion to the
Parties on the probable outcome should the matter be litigated,
and (b) if requested to do so by the Parties, make one or more
recommendations as to the terms of a possible settlement, upon
any conditions imposed by the Parties (including a minimum and
maximum amount).  The Neutral shall base his opinions and
recommendations on information then available to the Parties,
excluding only such information disclosed by any Party to the
Neutral in confidence but not disclosed to the other Party or
Parties.  The opinions and recommendations of the Neutral shall
not be binding on the Parties.

     16.11.    Termination of the Procedure.  The Parties shall
participate in the ADR to its conclusion (as designated by the
Neutral) and not terminate negotiations concerning resolution of
the matters in dispute until at least ten days thereafter.  No
Party shall commence a lawsuit or seek other remedies prior to
the conclusion of the ten-day post-ADR negotiation period,
provided that either Party may commence litigation within five
days prior to the date after which the commencement of litigation
could be barred by an applicable statute of limitations or
doctrine of laches, or in order to request a temporary
restraining order or preliminary injunction to prevent
irreparable harm, in which event the Parties shall continue
nevertheless (unless prohibited by court order) to participate in
the ADR to its conclusion.

				70
<PAGE>

     16.12.    Fees of the Neutral; Disqualification.  The Parties
shall share the fees of the Neutral equally.  The Neutral shall
be disqualified as a witness, consultant, expert or counsel for
either Party with respect to the matters in dispute and any
litigation or other matters relating thereto.

     16.13.    Confidentiality.  The procedures described above are
intended to constitute a compromise negotiation for purposes of
the Federal Rules of Evidence and state rules of evidence.  The
entire Procedure is confidential, and no stenographic, visual or
audio record shall be made.  All conduct, statements, promises,
offers, views and opinions, whether oral or written, made in the
course of the Procedure by any Party, its agents, employees,
representatives or other invitees, and by the Neutral (who will
be the Parties' joint agent for purposes of the Procedure) are
confidential and, where appropriate, shall be deemed to be work
product and privileged.  Such conduct, statements,
promises, offers, views and opinions shall not be discoverable or
admissible for any purposes, including impeachment, in any
litigation or other proceeding involving the Parties, and shall
not be disclosed to anyone not an agent, employee, expert,
witness or representative of any Party, provided that evidence
otherwise discoverable or admissible is not excluded from
discovery or admission as a result of its use in the Procedure.

17.0.     General

     17.1.     Schedules.

	(a)  The Schedules shall be construed with and as an integral
     part of this Agreement to the same extent as if the same had been
     set forth verbatim herein.  Any fact disclosed on one Schedule
     shall be deemed to be disclosed on each other applicable
     Schedule.  At or prior to Closing, Seller shall supplement the
     Schedules or deliver new Schedules as necessary to make each of
     the representations and warranties of Seller contained in Article
     3 and of the New Foundation contained in the Joinder Agreement
     true and correct in all material respects on and as of the
     Closing Date, provided that without Buyer's written consent, (i)
     Seller may not supplement any Schedule relating to the
     representations and warranties in Section 3.6, and (ii) no such
     supplement may exclude any Assets being conveyed to or purchased
     by Buyer or add any Permitted Encumbrances or any liabilities or
     obligations being assumed by Buyer.  Nothing in the Schedules
     shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a
     representation or warranty made herein unless the Schedule
     identifies the exception with reasonable particularity and,
     without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the mere
     listing of a document as an exception to any representation or
     warranty shall not be deemed to disclose the contents of such
     document as an exception to any representation or warranty.  Any
     Contracts, documents or other materials delivered by Seller or
     its advisors to any of Vanguard and Buyer shall be deemed to be
     delivered to each of Vanguard and Buyer.

	(b)  The Parties acknowledge that all of the Schedules
     anticipated to have been completed as of the Effective Date (the
     "Signing Schedules") have not been completed, and Seller shall
     not be in breach of any representation or warranty made in this
     Agreement by reason of the fact that all of the Signing Schedules
     are not in fact attached to this Agreement on the Effective Date
     of this Agreement.  Each Schedule on the List of Schedules that
     is

				71
<PAGE>

     marked with an asterisk is a "Final Schedule" and may not
     change without agreement of the Parties and shall not be governed
     by the provisions of this Section 17.1(b).  With respect to each
     missing Signing Schedule:

		(i)  Seller will prepare or complete a draft of all Signing
          Schedules (the "Draft Schedules") and deliver the Draft Schedules
          to Buyer as soon as possible after the Effective Date, but in any
          event no later than October 25, 2002.

               (ii) If any Draft Schedule is acceptable to Buyer, it will
          thereupon be a "Final Schedule"; and

               (iii)     If Buyer determines in its sole but reasonable
          discretion that a Draft Schedule is not acceptable, the Parties
          will attempt promptly and in good faith to resolve their
          differences with respect to the Draft Schedule, and if the
          parties reach a written agreement with respect to the Draft
          Schedule, the Draft Schedule will be a "Final Schedule".

	(c)  Each Final Schedule shall be deemed to be the corresponding
     Schedule referred to in this Agreement and shall be part of this
     Agreement as fully as if it had been appended on, and shall speak
     as of, the Effective Date.  Notwithstanding any other provision
     of this Agreement, if any Draft Schedule is for any reason
     whatsoever not delivered by Seller to Buyer on or before October
     25, 2002, or for any reason whatsoever does not become a Final
     Schedule pursuant to the provisions of this Section on or before
     November 11, 2002, then Buyer shall have the absolute right to
     terminate this Agreement on any date subsequent to November 11,
     2002.

	(d)  If Buyer determines reasonably and in good faith that any
     Omitted Contract should not be an Assumed Contract because it (i)
     is unreasonably burdensome on the operations of the Hospital
     Businesses, (ii) violates any Legal Requirement, or (iii) has
     been knowingly omitted by Seller from Schedule 2.1(e), then Buyer
     shall promptly notify Seller of such determination and, subject
     to the following sentence, such Omitted Contract will not be an
     Assumed Contract.  If Seller disagrees reasonably and in good
     faith with Buyer's determination that the Omitted Contract should
     not be an Assumed Contract, then such matter will be submitted to
     Vanguard's Chief Executive Officer and to Seller's Chairman, or
     their respective designees, who shall meet promptly after such
     submission and finally determine in good faith whether such
     Omitted Contract is or should be an Assumed Contract.  Such
     determination of Vanguard's Chief Executive Officer and Seller's
     Chairman, or their respective designees, shall be final and
     binding on the Parties.  If Vanguard's Chief Executive Officer
     and Seller's Chairman, or their respective designees, are unable
     to agree, the dispute shall be resolved pursuant to the
     provisions of Article 16.

     17.2.     CON Disclaimer.  This Agreement shall not be deemed to
be an acquisition or obligation of a capital expenditure or of
funds within the meaning of the certificate of need laws of any
state, until the appropriate Governmental Authorities shall have
granted a certificate of need or other appropriate approval or
determined that no certificate of need or other approval is
required.

				72
<PAGE>

     17.3.     Tax and Government Payment Program Effect.  None of the
Parties (nor such Parties' counsel or accountants) has made or is
making in this Agreement any representation to any other Party
(or such Party's counsel or accountants) concerning any of the
Tax or Government Payment Program effects or consequences on the
other Party of the transactions provided for in this Agreement.
Each Party represents that it has obtained, or may obtain,
independent Tax and Government Payment Program advice with
respect thereto and upon which it, if so obtained, has solely
relied.

     17.4.     Reproduction of Documents.  This Agreement as
originally executed and all documents relating hereto, including
consents, waivers and modifications which may hereafter be
executed, the Closing Documents, financial statements,
certificates and other information previously or hereafter
furnished to any Party, may be reproduced by any Party by any
photographic, microfilm, electronic or similar process and the
Parties may destroy any original documents so reproduced.  The
Parties stipulate that any such reproduction shall be admissible
in evidence as the original itself in any judicial, arbitral or
administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in
existence and whether or not such reproduction was made in the
ordinary course of business) and that any enlargement, facsimile
or further reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be
admissible in evidence; provided that an originally executed copy
of the Agreement or any other such document shall control over
any purported reproduction thereof to the extent of any
differences between the two.

     17.5.     Consented Assignment.  Anything contained herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign any Assumed Contract, claim or other right if
the assignment or attempted assignment thereof without the
consent of another Person would (i) constitute a breach thereof
or in any material way affect the rights of Seller thereunder;
(ii) be ineffective or render the Contract void or voidable, or
(iii) materially affect Seller's rights thereunder so that Buyer
would not in fact receive all such rights.  In any such event,
Seller shall cooperate in any reasonable arrangement designed to
provide for Buyer the benefits under any such Contract, claim or
right, including enforcement of any and all rights of Seller
against the other Person arising out of the breach or
cancellation by such other Person or otherwise.  After Closing,
the Parties shall continue to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to obtain the consent to the assignment of such Contract, claim
or right.

     17.6.     Time of Essence.  Time is of the essence in the
performance of this Agreement, provided that if the day on or by
which a notice must or may be given or the performance of any
Party's obligation is due is a Saturday, Sunday or holiday for
banks in San Antonio, Texas, then the day on or by which such
notice must or may be given or that such performance is due shall
automatically be extended to the first business day thereafter.
This Section may be waived only in a writing expressly referring
hereto.

     17.7.     Consents, Approvals and Discretion.  Except as herein
expressly provided to the contrary, whenever this Agreement
requires any consent or approval to be given by any Party or any
Party must or may exercise discretion, such consent or approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and such discretion
shall be reasonably exercised.

     17.8.     Choice of Law; Forum.  This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Texas without regard to such State's conflicts of laws rules, and
all remedies for dispute resolution arising under this Agreement,
including mediation, shall be conducted in San Antonio, Texas.

     17.9.     Benefit; Assignment.  This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective
legal representatives, successors and assigns, including BCFS if
Seller merges with BCFS.  No Party may assign this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other Parties.

     17.10.    Third Party Beneficiary.  The terms and provisions of
this Agreement (including provisions regarding employee and
employee benefit matters) are intended solely for the benefit of
the Parties, Buyer's Indemnified Persons with respect to Article
15, Seller's Indemnified Persons with respect to Article 15, and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, and are not
intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other
Person.  Any reference in this Agreement to one or more Employee
Benefit Plans of Buyer includes provisions, if any, in such plans
permitting their termination or amendment and any covenant in
this Agreement to provide any Employee Benefit Plan shall not be
deemed or construed to limit the right of Buyer to terminate or
amend such plan in accordance with its terms.

     17.11.    Waiver of Breach, Right or Remedy.  The waiver by any
Party of any breach or violation by another Party of any
provision of this Agreement or of any right or remedy permitted
the waiving Party in this Agreement (i) shall not waive or be
construed to waive any subsequent breach or violation of the same
provision (ii) shall not waive or be construed to waive a breach
or violation of any other provision, and (iii) shall be in
writing and may not be presumed or inferred from any Party's
conduct.  Except as expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement and except for the obligation of the Parties to first
utilize the ADR procedure in Article 16, no remedy conferred by
this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy,
and each and every remedy shall be in addition to every other
remedy granted in this Agreement or now or hereafter existing at
law or in equity, by statute or otherwise.  The election of any
one or more remedies by a Party shall not constitute a waiver of
the right to pursue other available remedies.  In addition to any
other rights and remedies any Party may have at law or in equity
for breach of this Agreement, each Party shall be entitled to
seek an injunction to enforce the provisions of this Agreement.

     17.12.    Notices.  Any notice, demand or communication required,

     17.13.    Misdirected Payments.  Seller shall remit to Buyer with
reasonable promptness any monies received by Seller after Closing
constituting or in respect of the Assets and Assumed Liabilities.
Buyer shall remit to Seller with reasonable promptness any monies
received by Buyer after Closing constituting or in respect of the
Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities.  If any Person
determines that funds previously paid or credited to the Hospital
Businesses in respect of services rendered prior to the Closing
Date have resulted in an overpayment or must be repaid, Seller
shall be responsible for the repayment of said monies (and the
defense of such actions).  If Buyer suffers any deduction to or
offset or withhold against amounts due either of them of funds
previously paid or credited to the Hospital Businesses in respect
of services rendered prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
immediately pay to Buyer, as the case may be, the amounts so
billed or offset upon demand.  Any amounts due Buyer by Seller or
its Affiliate, or due Seller by Buyer or its Affiliate, may be
offset against monies or other funds held by the Party entitled
to payment; provided that Seller shall first have the opportunity
to review the facts giving rise to the deduction, offset or
withhold and raise any related objection thereto.  Any dispute
between the Parties as to any deduction, offset or withholding
proposed under this Section 17.13 shall be resolved pursuant to
Article 16.

     17.14.    Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement is
held or determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under
any present or future law, and if the rights or obligations of
any Party under this Agreement will not be materially and
adversely affected thereby: (a) such provision will be fully
severable; (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as
if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never
comprised a part of this Agreement; (c) the remaining provisions
of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will
not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision or by its severance from this Agreement; and (d) in
lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there
will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal,
valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

     17.15.    Entire Agreement; Amendment.  This Agreement supersedes
all previous contracts, agreements and understandings and
constitutes the entire agreement of whatsoever kind or nature
existing between or among the Parties representing the within
subject matter and no Party shall be entitled to benefits other
than those specified herein.  As between or among the Parties,
any oral or written representation, agreement or statement not
expressly incorporated herein, whether given prior to or on the
Effective Date, shall be of no force and effect unless and until
made in writing and signed by the Parties on or after the
Effective Date.  The representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement shall survive the Closing and remain in full force
and effect as provided in Article 15, and shall survive the
execution and delivery of all other agreements, instruments or
other documents described, referenced or contemplated herein and
shall not be merged herewith or therewith.  This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each and all of which shall
be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute
the same instrument.  This Agreement may not be amended except in
a written instrument executed the Parties.

     17.16.    Interest.  Unless otherwise provided herein to the
contrary, any monies required to be paid by any Party to another
Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be due two business days
after demand therefor and if not paid when due shall accrue
interest from and after the due date to and including the date
full payment is made at an annual rate equal to the prime rate in
effect for the relevant period as reported by the Wall Street
Journal under "Money Rates".

     17.17.    Drafting.  No provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted for or against any Person on the basis that such
Person was the draftsman of such provision, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Person by
virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

     17.18.    Confidentiality; Public Announcements.

	(a)  Except for disclosure required by the applicable securities
     laws or other Legal Requirements, with respect to information
     provided by Seller to Buyer in connection with and relative to
     this proposed transaction, the executed Confidentiality Agreement
     dated March 14, 2002, in respect of confidentiality between
     Vanguard and Seller shall remain in effect until Closing.

	(b)  At all times before the Closing, Seller, on the one hand,
     and Buyer, on the other hand, will consult with the other before
     issuing or making any reports, statements or releases to the
     public with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
     contemplated hereby and will use good faith efforts to obtain the
     other Party's approval of the text of any public report,
     statement or release to be made on behalf of such Party.  If
     either Party is unable to obtain the approval of its public
     report, statement or release from the other Party and such
     report, statement or release is, in the opinion of legal counsel
     to such Party, necessary to discharge such Party's disclosure
     obligations under law, then such Party may make or issue the
     legally required report, statement or release and promptly
     furnish the other Party a copy thereof.

18.0.     Guarantee of Buyer's Obligations.

				76
<PAGE>

     Vanguard, as principal obligor and not merely as a surety,
hereby unconditionally guarantees full, punctual and complete
performance by Buyer of all of their obligations under this
Agreement and each of the Closing Documents subject to the terms
hereof and thereof and so undertakes to Seller and the New
Foundation that, if and whenever Buyer is in default, Vanguard
will on demand from Seller or the New Foundation duly and
promptly perform or procure the performance of Buyer's
obligations.  The foregoing guarantee is a continuing guarantee
and will remain in full force and effect until the obligations of
Buyer under this Agreement have been duly performed or discharged
and will continue to be effective or will be reinstated, as the
case may be, if at any time any sum paid to Seller must be
restored by Seller upon the bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization of Buyer. Vanguard's obligations under this
Section shall not be affected or discharged in any way by
any proceeding with respect to Buyer under any federal or state
bankruptcy, insolvency or debtor relief laws.
