footnotes thereto, were audited and reported upon by Mahoney  Cohen and Co.,
independent certified public accountants, in an unqualified auditors' opinion
with an explanatory paragraph only and substantially as follows: "The 
accompanying financial statements are those of Rocawear Licensing, LLC  only
and  are not those of the primary reporting entity. The combined financial
statements  of ROC Apparel Group LLC (formerly Urban Menswear LLC) and
Affiliates have  been  issued to their members as the financial statements
of the primary reporting  entity for the year ended December 31, 2005. The

Liabilities,  Business, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of

regular conduct of the  Business or the normal use or operation of the

nor has there been any material  damage, destruction or loss affecting the
Assets, Properties, Business  or  financial condition of Seller, whether or
not covered by insurance.

4.20 _Undisclosed  Liabilities_.  As of  December 31, 2006, Seller has no
knowledge of any Liabilities that will  not be  fully and adequately
reflected in the Financial Statements upon delivery  thereof  as
contemplated by Section 7.1(9) or on **Schedule  4.4**   hereto.  Except as
set forth in **Schedule 4.20**,  Seller  has no Liabilities, other than (1)
Liabilities that will be fully  and adequately reflected in the audited
Financial Statements for the year  ended December 31, 2006 and (2) those
incurred since December 31, 2006 in  the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices. Except  as set  forth in **Schedule 4.20** 
and  except to the extent specifically reflected or reserved against in the

or indirectly  liable, by guarantee or otherwise, upon or with respect to, or

terminated,  or threatened in writing to cancel or otherwise prematurely
terminate,  its  relationship with Seller or has in the last twelve (12)
months decreased  materially, or threatened to decrease or limit materially,
its usage of  the  products of Seller. Neither Seller nor any Principal has

its relationship with  Seller  or that the acquisition of the Assets by
Buyer will adversely affect the  relationship with any such licensee.

payments made by such licensees  under  the Specified Contracts for the
Seller's fiscal years ended December 31, 2005  and 2006 and projected

been  prepared by management of the Company on the basis of the assumptions
set  forth  therein, which management reasonably believes is fair and
reasonable in  light of  such licensees' historical performance and of

each pending claim thereunder of more than $l,000  with  respect to the
Tangible and Intangible Property to be acquired. All such  Insurance
Policies, true and correct copies of which have been delivered  to  Buyer,
are enforceable and in full force and effect. To Seller's knowledge,  Seller
is not in default with respect to any provision contained in any  such 
Insurance Policy nor has Seller failed to give any notice or present any 
claim  under any such Insurance Policy in due and timely fashion. Except for
claims  set  forth on **Schedule 4.23**,  there  are no outstanding unpaid
claims under any such Insurance Policy. Seller  has not  received a notice
of cancellation, non-renewal or audit of any such Insurance  Policy. Neither
Seller nor any Principal has knowledge of any material  inaccuracy in any
application for such Insurance Policies, any failure  to pay  premiums when
due or any similar state of facts which might form the basis  for 
termination of any such insurance. All Insurance Policies held by Seller  (1)
are "occurrence" policies with insurance companies which are  financially
sound and responsible, (2) are sufficient for compliance with  all
requirements of the Law and all Contracts to which Seller is a party,  (3)
insure against risks of the kind customarily insured against and in  amounts
customarily carried by insureds similarly situated, and (4) provide  to
Seller's knowledge and belief adequate insurance coverage for the Assets and 
operations of Seller.

of  Seller in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated  hereby, and no broker, finder, agent or similar intermediary is
entitled  to any  broker's fee, finder's fee, or similar fee or commission

**Schedule 4.24**  will be  paid by Seller.

4.25**   or any  other schedule, to Seller's knowledge, there are currently
no Real Property  leases, personal property leases, loans, guarantees,
Contracts, transactions,  understandings or other arrangements of any nature
between or among any  of the  Seller and any current or former member,
owner, shareholder, partner, director,  officer or controlling Person of any

such Earn-Out Share are being acquired for investment  purposes only and not
with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any  resale  or distri-

the Seller and  Principals has had the opportunity to ask questions and
receive answers  from  Buyer concerning Buyer, and have been furnished with
all other information  about  Buyer which it/he has requested. Each of the
Seller and Principals is an  "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a)
of the Securities Act of 1933,  as amended. Each of the Seller and Principals
believes that it/he has been  fully  apprised of all facts and circumstances
necessary to permit it/him to make  an  informed decision about acquiring
the Earn-Out Shares, that it/he has sufficient  knowledge and experience in
business and financial matters that it/he is  capable  of evaluating the
merits and risks of an investment in the Earn-Out Shares,  and  that it/he
has the capacity to protect its/his own interests in connection  with  the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Seller and Principals  has
been  advised by Buyer and understands that, (1) the Earn-Out Shares to be
issued  hereunder, from the date of issuance until the effectiveness of the
registration  statement that Buyer is required to file pursuant to the
Registration Rights  Agreement with respect to the re-sale of the Earn-Out
Shares, will not  be  registered under any federal or state securities laws,
(2) such Earn-Out  Shares must be held unless and until they are subsequently
registered or  an  exemption from registration becomes available, (3) except
as otherwise  provided in the Registration Rights Agreement, the certificates
representing  such Earn-Out Shares shall bear appropriate restrictive
legends, and  (4) prior to the registration of the Earn-Out Shares pursuant
to the  Registration Rights Agreement or the removal of the restrictive
legends  referred  to in clause (3) above, Buyer shall have the right to
direct the transfer  agent  of its common stock to place a stop transfer
order against such certificates.  None of the Seller nor any Principal have
sold any shares of capital stock,  membership interests or other securities
of either of the Seller or of  Buyer at  any time during the 30-day period
ending on the Closing Date.

comply  with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied

Agreement by  such  party or any of its Affiliates and representatives, (ii)
as becomes available  to  such party on a non-confidential basis from a

believed by such party to be bound by  a  confidentiality agreement or other
obligations of secrecy, (iii) as may  be  required in any report, statement

claims, arising under this Agreement or any other agreements to which such 
party, one or more of the other parties hereto and/or any of their
Affiliates  are parties; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,  that in  the case of
clauses (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv), the Person intending to  disclose

obliged  to  keep such information confidential and, to the extent

6.7 _Legal  Conditions to Transaction_.  Each of  the parties hereto shall

without limitation, filing and furnishing all information  required under the
HSR Act as promptly as practicable after the date hereof),  and in connection
therewith shall promptly cooperate with and furnish  information to each
other in connection with any such requirements imposed  upon  either of them
or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall (i) take

approval  of, or  any exemption by, any Governmental Entity or other third
party, required  to be  obtained or made by Seller for any of the conditions
set forth in Section  7 to  be satisfied (any of the foregoing, an
"Approval") or the taking of any action  required in furtherance thereof or
otherwise contemplated thereby or by  this  Agreement, (ii) diligently
oppose or pursue any rehearing, appeal or other  challenge which may be
available to it of any refusal to issue any Approval  or  of any order or
ruling of any Governmental Entity which may adversely affect  the  ability
of the parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated  hereby 
or to take any action contemplated by any Approval until such time as such 
refusal to issue any Approval or any order or ruling has become final and 
non-appealable, and (iii) diligently oppose any objections to, appeals  from
or  petitions to reconsider or reopen any Approval or the taking of any

prior to the Closing (or as soon as practicable thereafter),  with  audited
financial statements of the Business sold to Buyer for the three  (3)  most
recently completed fiscal years of Seller prior to Closing, and to  review 
all interim period financial statements of the Business, that Buyer will 
be  required to file with the SEC under Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X (on 
Form 8-K or Form 8-K/A). Buyer will reimburse Seller for the actual costs 
charged by Auditors engaged by Seller for such audit and review. In
connection  with the performance of such audit and review, Seller agrees to
(i) provide  Auditors, upon reasonable notice and during normal business
hours, with  full and  timely assistance and access to, and to examine and
make copies of, all  books  and records of Seller and its Affiliates
relating to the Business, and  authorize  the Independent Auditors for
Seller and its Affiliates, to provide all  work  papers, (ii) close the
books of the Business as of the Closing Date in  accordance with GAAP, (iii)
prepare all appropriate income tax provisions,  (iv)  draft the combined

statements  of  the Business to comply with the rules and regulations of the
SEC.

 

 

6.9 _Administration  of Specified Contracts_.  During  any period which
Seller is entitled to receive Earn-Out Consideration under  this  Agreement,
Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to maximize the  royalty
income payable to Buyer under the Specified Contracts and any licenses  of
the Rocawear Marks entered into by Buyer or its Affiliates subsequent  to
the  Closing so as to enable Seller to achieve the maximum payment of Earn-
Out  Consideration pursuant to Section 3.3 hereof, including without
limitation  (a)  actively marketing, promoting and advertising the Marks,
(b) prosecuting  third  party infringement of the Marks, and (c) acting in a
commercially reasonable  manner with respect to any decisions to terminate,
extend, renew, amend  or  enforce Buyer's rights under any such Specified
Contract or other license, or to  waive any rights of Buyer or such Affiliate
thereunder.

 

 

6.10 _Name  Change_.  Seller  shall promptly after the Closing Date (and in
any event within thirty (30)  calendar days) change its corporate name to a
name which does not include  any of  the words "Rocawear" and will furnish a
certificate, satisfactory to Buyer,  indicating such name change.  Seller 
shall promptly after the Closing Date (and in any event within thirty (30) 
calendar days) cause any entity controlled by or under common control with 
Seller, directly or indirectly, to change its name to a name which does 
not  include any of the words "Rocawear" (including "ROC") and will furnish
a  certificate,  satisfactory to Buyer,  indicating such name change.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 

 

6.11 _Account  Receivables; Royalties, Rent_.  Following the Closing, Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts  to  collect any accounts
receivable with respect to the Assets, whether pursuant  to  the Specified
Contracts or a new license or similar agreement entered into  after  the
Closing. In addition, Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that all 
royalties under the Specified Contracts accruing for periods through the 
Closing  Date are for the account of Seller, even if such royalties are not
required  to  be paid by the licensees until after the Closing. If the
Closing Date occurs  on  or prior to March 31, 2007, Seller shall be
entitled to an amount equal  to the  total royalties received by Buyer in
respect of the quarter ending March  31,  2007 multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of calendar  days from January 1, 2007
through the Closing Date and the denominator  of which  is 90, and Buyer
shall be entitled to the balance of such royalties. If  the  Closing Date
occurs after March 31, 2007 but on or prior to June 30, 2007,  Seller shall
be entitled to an amount equal to the total royalties received  by  Buyer in
respect of the six months ending June, 2007 multiplied by a fraction  the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days from January 1, 2007 
through the Closing Date and the denominator of which is 181, and Buyer 
shall be  entitled to the balance of such royalties. Upon collection by Buyer
or  an  Affiliate of any such royalties for the account of Seller, Buyer or
such  Affiliate will hold such royalties in trust for Seller and will pay
such  royalties to Seller not later than 15 days following receipt thereof,
together  with a certification of Buyer's Chief Financial Officer setting
forth in  reasonable detail the information with respect to royalties for the
quarter  ending March 31, 2007 or the six months ending June 30, 2007, as
applicable,  of  the type that would be required to be reported under
paragraph (a) of Exhibit  E  hereof, together with the calculation of the
amount payable to Seller pursuant  to this Section 6.11 and the
certifications required pursuant to such paragraph  (a). The provisions of
paragraph (a) of Exhibit E hereof shall apply to  the  resolution of any
dispute between Buyer and Seller relating to the calculation  of amounts
payable to Seller under this Section 6.11. Without the prior  written 
consent of Seller, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliate not to, 
waive  any right to receive such royalties or otherwise enter into any
written  or oral  agreement or understanding with a licensee under any
Specified Contract  that  would have the effect of reducing the amount of
royalties payable under  such  Specified Contract for the period from
January 1, 2007 through the Closing  Date,  other than in a manner and
amount that is consistent with past practice  of  Seller with respect to the
licensee that is a party to such agreement or  understanding. Advertising
fees paid pursuant to the Specified Contracts  for the  period from January
1, 2007 through the Closing Date shall be for the account  of  Seller and
advertising fees payable pursuant to the Specified Contracts  for any 
period after the Closing Date shall be for the account of Buyer. As promptly 
as  practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer shall instruct all
licensees  under  any Specified Contract who license showroom space at
Seller's Affiliates' premises at 1411 Broadway to pay the rent due under the
Specified Contracts  in  respect of such showroom space directly to Seller's
Affiliates or its designee.  To the extent that any Specified Contract
contains the contractual obligation  that a licensee pay to Seller or its
Affiliates any amount for the use  and  occupancy of the Seller's
Affiliates' premises, Buyer for such limited purpose  only does hereby
reassign to Seller or its designee any and all such rights  and  the
payments with respect thereto. In the event that any such payments  of rent 
are received by Buyer, Buyer shall hold such payments in trust for Seller 
and  promptly pay them to Seller.

resulting  from the following:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28  

 

 

 

 

 

(1) any  misrepresentation or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or  agreement of Seller and Principals contained in this Agreement
or in any  certificate delivered at the Closing pursuant to this Agreement;

 

 

(2) any  and  all of the Excluded Liabilities, whether known or unknown on

breach of any  representation or warranty made by Seller and Principals
herein;

 

 

(3) the  Proceedings described in Part 1 of **Schedule  4.11**   hereof;

11.3 _Third  Party Claims_.  If a  claim by a third party is made against
any party or parties hereto and  the party  or parties against whom said
claim is made intends to seek indemnification  with  respect thereto under
Sections 11.1 or 11.2, the party or parties seeking  such  indemnification
shall promptly notify the indemnifying party or parties,  in  writing, of
such claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the rights of the indemnified  party or parties
hereunder except to the extent that such failure materially  and  adversely
affects the indemnifying party or parties due to the inability  to  timely
defend such action. The indemnifying party or parties shall have  ten (10) 
business days after said notice is given to elect, by written notice given 
to  the indemnified party or parties, to undertake, conduct and control,
through  counsel of their own choosing (subject to the consent of the
indemnified  party  or parties, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld) and at their  sole risk  and expense, the good faith settlement or
defense of such claim, and the  indemnified party or parties shall cooperate
with the indemnifying parties  in  connection therewith; provided: (a) (i)
all settlements require the prior  reasonable consultation with the
indemnified party, and (ii) all settlements  other than those involving only
the payment of money by the indemnifying  party  and the full release by the
claimants of all claims asserted against the  indemnified party, require the
prior written consent of the indemnified  party,  which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, and (b) the indemnified  party  or parties shall be
entitled to participate in such settlement or defense  through counsel chosen
by the indemnified party or parties, provided that  the  fees and expenses
of such counsel shall be borne by the indemnified party  or  parties. So
long as the indemnifying party or parties are contesting any  such  claim in
good faith, the indemnified party or parties shall not pay or  settle  any
such claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  notwithstanding the foregoing,
the indemnified party or parties shall have  the  right to pay or settle any
such claim at any time, provided that in such  event  they shall waive any
right of indemnification therefor by the indemnifying  party  or parties. If
the indemnifying party or parties do not make a timely election  to undertake
the good faith defense or settlement of the claim as aforesaid,  or  if the
indemnifying parties fail to proceed with the good faith defense  or 
settlement of the matter after making such election, then, in either such 
event,  the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to contest,
settle  or  compromise (provided that all settlements or compromises require
the prior  reasonable consultation with the indemnifying party and the prior
written  consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably  withheld) the claim at their exclusive discretion, at the risk
and expense  of  the indemnifying parties.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29  

 

 

 

 

 

11.4 _Assistance_.  Regardless of which party is controlling the defense of
any claim, each  party  shall act in good faith and shall provide reasonable
documents and cooperation  to the party handling the defense.

 

 

11.5 _Limitation  on Losses_.  With  respect to indemnification claims
under this Section 11:

 

 

(1) No  party  to this Agreement shall have an obligation for
indemnification under this  Section 11 unless the aggregate Losses (other
than Losses to which neither  the  Cap nor the Basket apply, as described in
sub paragraph 5 of this Section  11.5)  suffered by the Seller Indemnitees
or Buyer Indemnitees, as the case may  be,  under Sections 11.1 or 11.2,
respectively, exceed $2,000,000 (the "Basket").  Losses to which the Basket
applies, as described in the preceding sentence,  are  hereinafter referred
to as the "Basket Losses." At such time as their Basket  Losses exceed
$2,000,000 in the aggregate, the Seller Indemnitees or Buyer  Indemnitees, as
applicable, shall be entitled to be indemnified against  the full  amount of
all such Basket Losses that have been incurred or suffered by  such 
indemnitees for which they are entitled to be indemnified under this
Agreement  (and not merely the portion of such Basket Losses exceeding 
$2,000,000).

 

 

(2) The  maximum aggregate amount of Losses for which Seller and the
Principals  on the  one hand, and Buyer on the other hand, shall be liable
under this Section  11  shall be $50,000,000 (the "Cap").

 

 

(3) The  amount of any Losses incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnitees
or  Buyer  Indemnitees (i) shall be increased by any Tax incurred or
reasonably expected  to  be incurred as a result of or related to any such
Losses, including any  Tax  related to the inclusion in gross income of
insurance proceeds or a payment,  and  (ii) shall be reduced by any Tax
benefit realized or reasonably expected  to be  realized as a result of or
related to any such Losses.

 

 

(4) The  amount of any Loss incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnitees or
Buyer  Indemnitees shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds or other third
party  recoveries received by such Indemnitees in connection with the
breach,  failure  or other event which gave rise to such Loss (net of any
costs incurred  by such  Indemnitees in connection with the collection of
such insurance proceeds  or  other third party recoveries).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30  

 

 

 

 

 

(5) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, neither the Cap nor the Basket shall
apply to any Losses  arising  out of, or related to, (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty  contained in Sections 4.1 (Due Organization and
Qualification), 4.3 (Authority  to Execute), 4.11 (Judgments and
Proceedings), 4.13 (Contracts), 4.17  (Intangibles), 4.18 (Title), 4.24 (No
Broker), 5.1 (Organization), 5.2  (Authorization) or 5.5 (No Broker), (ii)
any breach of any of the covenants  to  be performed under this Agreement by
any of the parties hereto after the  Closing, or (iii) the Excluded
Liabilities.

 

 

(6) Seller  shall only be entitled to indemnification for Losses resulting
from a breach  by  Buyer of the representations or warranties set forth in
Section 5.6 of  this  Agreement with respect to any Buyer Stock which is
issued as Earn-Out  Consideration.

 

 

11.6 _Right  of Set-Off_.  In the  event that any Buyer Indemnitee has any
claim against the Principals or  Seller  under this Agreement for which it
is entitled to indemnification as set  forth in  this Section 11, Buyer
shall have the right, but not the obligation, in  its sole  and absolute
discretion, to set-off such claim against any amounts that  may be  owed to
Seller under this Agreement (other than the Second Earn-Out  Consideration
which shall not be subject to set-off hereunder); _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that no  set-off pursuant to this Section 11.6 shall be permitted until the
resolution  of  any dispute respecting the obligation to pay any such amount
by operation  of  Section 11.7 hereof.

 

 

11.7 _Dispute  Resolution Procedure_.

 

 

(1) In  the  event that any Indemnitee or group of Indemnitees is seeking
indemnification  pursuant to this Section 11, such Indemnitee(s) shall notify
the Indemnitor(s)  thereof, which notice (the "Indemnity Notice") shall set
forth in reasonable  detail the facts and circumstances giving rise to the
Losses for which  indemnity  is sought, the amount (or estimated amount)
thereof (including the basis  for the  calculation of the Losses, the amount
of costs and expenses incurred by  such  Indemnitee(s) and, if then known,
the amount of any adjustment to or deduction  from the amount of Losses
subject to indemnification as a result of the  Basket  or Cap or the other
provisions of Section 11.5 hereof. If the Indemnitor(s)  disagree with any
matter set forth in an Indemnity Notice, such Indemnitor(s)  shall provide
the Notifying Indemnitee(s) with notice of such disagreement 
(the "Indemnity Dispute Notice") within thirty (30) days following the date
of which  the applicable Indemnity Notice was given. Such Indemnity Dispute
Notice  shall  set forth in reasonable detail the nature and basis of such
disagreement  together with the view of the Indemnitor(s), if any, of the
amount of any  indemnity payment to which the Indemnitee(s) should be
entitled. If the  Indemnitor(s) do not deliver an Indemnity Dispute Notice
within such thirty  (30)  day period, Indemnitor(s) shall be deemed to have
agreed with the matters  set  forth in the Indemnity Notice. If
Indemnitor(s) timely provide a Dispute  Notice,  then the senior executives
and principals of Indemnitor(s) and Indemnitee(s)  shall meet promptly (with
their respective counsel or other representatives,  as  they may determine)
and attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute.  If such  executives have
met but failed to resolve such dispute within twenty (20)  days  after the
date on which the Indemnity Dispute Notice is given, either  Indemnitor(s) or
Indemnitee(s) may submit such dispute for final and binding  arbitration in
accordance with Section 11.8 hereof. In any such arbitration,  the 
Arbitrators (as hereinafter defined) shall not be permitted to award Losses 
in  an amount in excess of those set forth in the Indemnity Notice or less 
than the  amount set forth in the Indemnity Dispute Notice, except in either
case  with  respect to amounts constituting adjustments or deductibles which
were not  known  at the time the applicable notice was given.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31  

 

 

 

 

 

11.8 _Arbitration_.  All  disputes arising under this Agreement that are not
resolved by the parties  hereto, shall be subject to binding arbitration in
The City of New York  by a  panel of three (3) arbitrators (the
"Arbitrators") pursuant to the commercial  arbitration rules then prevailing
of the American Arbitration Association  ("AAA"), as supplemented herein, and
judgment upon the award rendered by the  Arbitrators may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction thereof. Arbitrator  compensation and expenses
shall be advanced equally by Indemnitor(s) on  the one  hand and
Indemnitee(s) on the other hand. The Indemnitor(s) and Indemnitee(s)  shall
instruct the AAA to hold an administrative conference with counsel  for the 
parties within twenty (20) days after the filing of the demand for
arbitration.  The parties and the AAA shall thereafter cooperate in order to
complete  the  appointment of the Arbitrators as quickly as possible. Within
ten (10)  days  after all three Arbitrators have been appointed, the
Indemnitor(s) and  Indemnitee(s) shall seek to have an initial meeting among
the Arbitrators  and  counsel for the parties for the purpose of
establishing a plan for  administration of the arbitration, including (a)
scope, timing and types  of  discovery, which may at the discretion of the
Arbitrators include production  of  documents in the possession of the
parties, but may not without consent  of all  parties include depositions;
(b) exchange of documents and filing of detailed  statement of claim and
prehearing memoranda; (c) schedule and place(s)  of  hearing; and (d) any
other matters that may promote the efficient, expeditious  and cost-effective
conduct of the proceeding. Except as otherwise expressly  provided herein,
each party shall bear its own costs and expenses in any  such  arbitration
proceeding. The award of the Arbitrators may be enforced in  any  court of
competent jurisdiction. The Arbitrators shall not award punitive  or  other
exemplary damages respecting any dispute arising under this  Agreement.

 

 

11.9 _Payments  Treated as Purchase Price Adjustment_.  Any  payment
pursuant to this Section 11 will be treated for tax purposes as  an 
adjustment to the Purchase Price hereunder.

 

 

11.10 _Remedies  Exclusive; No Recourse_.  The  remedies provided in this
Section 11 shall be the exclusive remedies (except  with respect to equitable
remedies) of the parties hereto after the Closing  in  connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for any  breach  or non-
performance of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement  contained
in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered at  Closing.

 

 

12. _Waiver  of Bulk Sales Compliance_.  Buyer  waives compliance by Seller with the provisions of Article 6 of the Uniform  Commercial Code (Bulk Sales Law) and all other Laws relating to bulk sale  in  each applicable jurisdiction. Seller and Principals will, jointly and severally,  indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from, against and with respect to, and  shall  reimburse Buyer for any and all Losses suffered or incurred by Buyer arising  out  of, relating to or by reason of such waiver or any noncompliance with such  Laws. This indemnification shall apply to, but shall not be limited to,  Losses  due to any acceleration of payment with respect to any Liability or obligation  of Seller assumed by Buyer hereunder, and is in addition to the indemnification  provided pursuant to Section 11.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32  

 

 

 

 

 

13. _Expenses_.  Except  as expressly provided to the contrary herein, whether or not the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement shall be consummated, each party shall pay  its  own expenses incident to preparing for, entering into and carrying into  effect  this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Seller shall be  responsible for and make arrangements to pay all sales, transfer, stamp,  recording and similar Taxes, if any, incurred in connection with any Assets  conveyed to Buyer hereunder.

 

 

14. _Termination_.  This  Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

 

 

(1) by  the  mutual consent of Buyer and Seller;

 

 

(2) by  either  Buyer or Seller if there has been a material
misrepresentation, breach  of  warranty or breach of covenant on the part of
the other in the representations,  warranties and covenants set forth in this
Agreement;

 

 

(3) by  either  Buyer or Seller if the transactions contemplated hereby have
not been  consummated by April 30, 2007; provided that, neither Buyer nor
Seller  will be  entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 14(3) if  such  party's willful breach of this Agreement has
prevented the consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby;

 

 

(4) by  Buyer  if, after the date hereof, there shall have been a material
adverse change  in  the financial condition of the Business or Assets;

 

 

(5) by  Seller  if, after the date hereof, there shall have been a material
adverse change  in  the financial condition or business of Buyer; or

 

 

(6) by  either  Buyer or Seller if any Law preventing or prohibiting
consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby shall have become final
and  nonappealable.

 

 

15. _Further  Assurances_.

 

 

15.1 At  any  time and from time to time after the Closing Date, at Buyer's
request and  without further consideration, Seller and Principals will
promptly execute  and  deliver all such further documents or perform such
acts as Buyer may reasonably  request in order to more fully consummate the
transactions contemplated  herein  and in order to more effectively vest,
transfer the right, title and interest  of  Buyer in the Assets.

 

 

15.2 After  the  Closing Date, Seller and Principals shall do the following:

 

 

(1) Deliver  to Buyer all notices, correspondence and other items relating to
the Business  and/or the Assets which are from time to time received by them
or are in  their  possession.

 

 

(2) File  with  the appropriate governmental body documents sufficient to
effect a change  of  Seller's name to one not similar to its current name
and send proof of such  filing and proper advertising thereof to Buyer, and
file with each jurisdiction  listed in **Schedule 4.1**  such  documents as
are necessary to effectuate such change of name in each such  jurisdiction.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 

 

16. _Non  Compete; Non Disparagement_.

 

 

16.1 With  respect to Carter (and not with respect to Bize and Cher), the
restrictive  covenants contained in Section 7(a) of the Endorsement Agreement
are  incorporated by reference herein as if fully set forth herein. With
respect  to  each of Bize and Cher (and not with respect to Carter), the
restrictive  covenants contained in Section 5(b) of the U.S. License are
incorporated  by  reference herein as if fully set forth herein.

 

 

16.2 For  purposes of clarification, but not of limitation, each Seller and
Principal  acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of Section 16.1 above
shall  serve as  a prohibition against it or he, during the period described
therein, directly  or  indirectly, hiring, offering to hire, enticing away
or in any other manner  persuading or attempting to persuade any officer,
employee, agent, lessor,  lessee, licensor, licensee, customer, prospective
customer or supplier  of the  Business or any business of Buyer and the
Subsidiaries to discontinue or  alter  his or its relationship such
business.

 

 

16.3 The  parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that (i) Buyer would
be  irreparably injured in the event of a breach by any of the Seller or
Principals  of any of their obligations under this Section 16, (ii) monetary
damages  would not be an adequate remedy for any such breach, and (iii) Buyer
shall  be entitled to injunctive relief, in addition to any other remedy
which  it may  have, in the event of any such breach. It is hereby also
agreed that the  existence of any claims which Seller or Principals may have
against Buyer,  whether under this Agreement or otherwise, shall not be a
defense to the  enforcement by Buyer of any of the rights under this Section
16.

 

 

16.4 It  is the  intent of the parties hereto that the covenants contained
in this Agreement  shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under
the laws of and  public  policies of each jurisdiction in which enforcement
is sought (the Seller  and  Principals hereby acknowledge that said
restrictions are reasonably necessary  for the protection of Buyer).
Accordingly, it is hereby agreed that if  any one  or more of the provisions
of Section 16 shall be adjudicated to be invalid  or unenforceable for any
reason whatsoever, said provision shall be (only  with  respect to the
operation thereof in the particular jurisdiction in which  such 
adjudication is made) construed by limiting and reducing it so as to be 
enforceable to the extent permissible.

 

 

16.5 The  provisions of this Section 16 shall be in addition to, and not in
lieu  of, any  other obligations with respect to the subject matter hereof,
whether arising  as  a matter of contract, by law or otherwise.

 

 

17. _Miscellaneous_.

 

 

17.1 _Publicity_.  Subject  to 6.6, the parties shall consult with each
other before issuing any press  release with respect to the Agreement or the
transactions contemplated  hereby  and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement  without the prior consent of the
other parties, which shall not be unreasonably  withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  Buyer may, without the prior
consent of the other parties (but after prior  consultation, to the extent
practicable in the circumstances) issue such  press  release or make such
public statement as may upon the advice of outside  counsel  be required by
Law or the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market  or  the rules
of any other applicable exchange, provided that the information  contained in
such press release or public statement accurately describes  the  terms of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 

17.2 _Notices_.  Any  notice or other communication required or which may be

addressee, or mailed,  certified or registered mail or express mail, postage
prepaid, or sent  by a  nationally recognized courier service, service

17.3 _Integration;  Schedules_.  This  Agreement (including the exhibits
and schedules hereto) contains the entire  agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and  supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous agreements, written or oral, with  respect thereto.
Disclosure of information set forth on any schedule to  this  Agreement
shall be deemed to qualify as disclosure on any other schedule  required by
this Agreement (regardless of whether or not such other section  is 
qualified by reference to such other schedule) so long as application to 
such  section is reasonably discernible from the reading of such
disclosure.  No  information set forth on any schedule shall be deemed to
broaden in any  way the  scope of Sellers' of Principals' representations
and warranties. The inclusion  of any item on a schedule is not evidence of
the materiality of such item  for  purposes of this Agreement, or that such
item is a disclosure required  under  this Agreement. Any description of any
agreement, instrument, document,  plan,  arrangement or other item set forth
in a schedule is a summary only and  is  qualified in its entirety by the
terms of such agreement, instrument, document,  plan, arrangement or item,
true and correct copies of which have been provided  to Buyer. No disclosure
in any schedule relating to any possible breach  or  violation of any
agreement or Law shall be construed as an admission or  indication that any
such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred,  or  shall
constitute an admission of liability to any third party.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

17.4 _Waivers  and Amendments_.  This  Agreement may be amended, modified,
superseded or cancelled and the terms  and  conditions hereof may be waived,
only by a written instrument signed by  all the  parties or, in the case of
a waiver, by the party waiving compliance. No  delay  on the part of any
party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder  shall operate as
a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of  any party  of any
right, power or privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or partial 
exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other  or 
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege  hereunder. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumula-tive
and  are not  exclusive of any rights or remedies which any party may
otherwise have  at law or  in equity. The rights and remedies of any party
arising out of or otherwise  in  respect of any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation, warranty,  covenant  or agreement contained in this
Agreement shall in no way be limited by  the fact  that the act, omission,
occurrence, or other state of facts upon which  any claim  of any such
inaccuracy or breach is based may also be the subject matter  of any  other
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this  Agreement
(or in any other agreement between the parties) as to which there  is  no
inaccuracy or breach.

 

 

17.5 _Binding  Agreement_.  All of  the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure  to the  benefit of and be
enforceable by each of the parties hereto and their respective  heirs, legal
representatives, executors, successors and assigns.

 

 

17.6 _Governing  Law_.  This  Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of  the  State of New York applicable to agreements
made, delivered and to be performed  entirely within such State.

 

 

17.7 _Assignment_.  This  Agreement and the rights and obligations of the
parties hereto shall not  be  assigned by any party to any Person without
the prior written consent of  the  other party; provided that Buyer may
assign its rights under this Agreement  to  any Subsidiary of Buyer, but no
such assignment shall relieve Buyer of  its  obligations hereunder, provided
further that any of Seller, Carter, Bize  or Cher  with respect to the First
Earn-Out Consideration and either Seller or Carter  with respect to the
Second Earn-Out Consideration may direct Buyer to issue  the  Earn-Out
Consideration to up to an aggregate of ten (10) Person(s) designated  by 
such party, in such proportions as such party shall indicate by written 
notice  to Buyer, provided that each such designee, if requested by Buyer,
shall  provide  to Buyer representations, warranties and covenants
substantially in the  form of  those included in Section 4.26 hereof, with
such changes as reasonably  necessary  to comply with then-applicable Law.
Nothing in this Agreement, unless otherwise  expressly provided, is intended
to confer upon any Person, other than the  parties hereto and their
successors and permitted assigns, any rights or  remedies under or by reason
of this Agreement.

 

 

17.8 _Variations  in Pronouns_.  All  pronouns and any variations thereof
refer to the masculine, feminine or  neuter,  singular or plural, as the
identity of the person or persons may  require.

 

 

17.9 _Severability_.  If any  provision of this Agreement shall be
determined by a court of competent  jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable, such determination shall not  affect  the remaining
provisions of this Agreement, all of which shall remain in  full  force and
effect.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

17.10 _Counterparts_.  This  Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall  be  deemed an original but all of which
together shall constitute one and the  same  instrument.

 

 

17.11 _Exhibits  and Schedules_.  The  exhibits and sched-ules to this
Agreement are a part of this Agreement  as if set  forth in full herein.
