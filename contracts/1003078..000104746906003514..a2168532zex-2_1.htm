forth in Article VII, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Buchanan

### (a) _The State ment_. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date,
Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Statement"),
setting forth the Reference Net Assets as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (the "Closing Reference Net Assets") determined in accordance

the

  

###

### 

  

### Reference Net Assets (including GAAP and SEC rules and regulations
consistently applied) as set forth in Schedule 2.02. After the Closing Date,
at Sellers request, Buyer shall assist Seller and its representatives in the
preparation of the Statement and shall provide Seller and its representatives
any information reasonably requested.

  

### (b) _Objections; Resolutions, Dispute s_.

  

#### (1) Unless Buyer notifies Seller in writing within thirty (30) days
after Sellers delivery of the Statement of any objection to any component of
the computation of the Closing Reference Net Assets set forth therein (the
"Notice of Objection"), such computation shall be final and binding. During
such 30-day period, Buyer and its representatives shall be permitted to
review during normal business hours, as they shall reasonably request, the
books, records and working papers of Seller relating to the Statement. Any
Notice of Objection shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for the
objections set forth therein. The Parties acknowledge that (A) the purpose of
the determination of the Closing Reference Net Assets is to adjust the
Purchase Price so as to reflect the change in Reference Net Assets
from December 31, 2005 to the Closing Date; and (B) such change is to be
measured on a totally consistent basis so that the calculation is to be done
using the same accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies
used by Seller in the preparation of the Reference Net Assets.

  

#### (2) If Buyer provides the Notice of Objection to Seller within such
30-day period, Seller and Buyer shall, during the 30-day period following
Sellers receipt of the Notice of Objection, attempt in good faith to resolve
Buyers objections. During the 30-day period following Sellers receipt of
the Notice of Objection, Seller and its representatives shall be
permitted to review during normal business hours, as they shall reasonably
request, the working papers of Buyer relating to the Notice of Objection and
the basis therefor. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve all such
objections within such 30-day period, the matters remaining in dispute shall
be submitted to Deloitte and Touche, LLP or an internationally recognized
public accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer (or, if
Seller and Buyer are unable to so agree within 10 days after the end of such
30-day period or the firm so selected declines to act, then Seller and Buyer
shall each select an internationally recognized public accounting firm and
such firms shall jointly select a third internationally recognized public
accounting firm to resolve the disputed matters (such determining firm being
the "Independent Expert")). Seller and Buyer shall instruct the Independent
Expert to render its written decision as promptly as practicable but in no
event later than 30 days after its selection. The resolution of the disputed
matters by the Independent Expert shall be final and binding, and the
determination of the Independent Expert shall constitute an arbitral award
that is final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a judgment may be
entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Expert shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty
percent (50%) by Buyer. After final determination of the Closing Reference Net
Assets, neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any further right to make any
claims against each other in respect of any post- Closing Purchase Price
adjustments hereunder.

  

### (c) _Adjust ment Payment_. The Purchase Price shall be: (i) increased
by the amount by which the Closing Reference Net Assets exceed the Reference
Net Assets or (ii) decreased by the amount by which the Closing Reference
Net Assets are less than the Reference

  

### 

  

### 12   

     
   

  

### 

  

### Net Assets (the amount of any such increase or decrease being hereinafter
called the "Post-Closing Adjustment Amount"). Within 10 days after the
Closing Reference Net Assets have been finally determined in accordance with
Section 2.04(b), if the Purchase Price is: (i) increased, then Buyer shall
pay to Seller an amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount,
together with interest thereon at a rate of 4.25% per annum from the Closing
Date to the date of payment; or (ii) decreased, Seller shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount, together with interest
thereon at a rate of 4.25% per annum from the Closing Date to the date of
payment. Any such payment hereunder shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing
by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be.

  

### (d) _Cooperatio n_. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth
herein, each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with and promptly make available to the other Parties and its
representatives, all information and records and data, with reasonable access
to its personnel and shall permit the other Parties and its representatives to
make copies of all information and records in each case as may be reasonably
required in connection with the analysis of the Statement and the resolution
of any dispute(s) thereunder.

### (u) _Sarbanes-Oxley_. Kennametals internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. Managements report on internal control over financial
reporting as of June 30, 2005 is included in Kennametals 2005 Annual Report
on Form 10-K filed September 9, 2005.  That report states that based upon
managements assessment, Kennametal maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) as of June 30, 2005, based on criteria in
Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Managements assessment of
the effectiveness of Kennametals internal control over financial reporting
as of June 30, 2005 was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as stated in
their report included in Kennametals 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  JandLs internal control over
financial reporting was included (to the extent applicable to Kennametal
taken as a whole) in the scope of managements assessment as of June 30,
2005.  Kennametal did not identify any material weaknesses in
Kennametals internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005.
Management has not completed an assessment of its internal control over
financial reporting as of any period subsequent to the assessment included in
Kennametals 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Kennametals chief executive
officer and chief financial officer executed the certifications required by
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as of June 30, 2005.
These certifications are included in Kennametals 2005 Annual Report on Form
10-K.  As of June 30, 2005, there were no significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting related to JandL based on managements assessment as of
June 30, 2005 which was completed based on the consolidated results of
operations and financial position of Kennametal. In addition, as of June 30,

8.05. _E mployee Matters_.

  

### (a) Employment of all persons employed by JandL as of the Closing
Date ("JandL Employees"), including employees who are not actively at work on
account of any illness or injury ("Disability") of less than six months
duration as of the Closing Date ("Short Term Disability"), but excluding all
persons who were formerly employed by JandL or predecessors thereof, including,
without limitation, those who are, as of the Closing Date, (A) retired or (B)
not actively at work due to any Disability of six (6) months or longer
duration as of the Closing Date ("Long Term Disability"), shall not be
deemed terminated or interrupted by reason of the transactions contemplated
in this Agreement. Such employees shall be eligible to participate in the
employee benefit plans and programs (other than those providing for equity
based compensation except as expressly determined by MSC in its sole
discretion) of MSC in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of each such
employee benefit plan or program.  Nothing in this Agreement shall require
MSC to, or require MSC to cause JandL to, establish, maintain, operate or
administer any employee benefit plan or program not in effect as of the date
of this Agreement.

  

### (b) All JandL Employees for whom Buyer shall offer employee benefit plans
and programs pursuant to Section 8.05 will cease participation in, and shall
cease to be covered by, all employee benefits plans and programs of
Kennametal and its Affiliates as of the Closing Date, provided that, with
respect to any benefits accrued or payable as of the Closing Date under any
employee benefit plans or programs of JandL or Kennametal, such employees shall
continue to be entitled to such benefits after the Closing Date payable by
Kennametal or any Employee Benefit Plans.

  

### (c) With respect to JandL Employees, Buyer shall recognize service with
JandL or Kennametal, and its Affiliates and predecessors thereof, for purposes
of determining (i) eligibility for vacation benefits, short term disability
or weekly accident and sickness benefits, severance benefits, service
recognition and other similar programs and (ii) eligibility and vesting under
all other employee benefit plans and programs of Buyer applicable to such
employees, to the extent such service was recognized by JandL or Kennametal for
such purposes; provided, that Buyer shall not be obligated to give credit for
such service to the extent it would result in duplication of any benefits to
which such an employee is entitled to or had previously received under any
comparable employee benefit plans or programs maintained by JandL or
Kennametal.

  

### (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Buyer or JandL to retain
any JandL Employees for any period of time after the Closing Date and, subject
to requirements of applicable law, Buyer reserves the right, at any time
after the Closing Date, to terminate such employment and, except as expressly
stated in this Agreement, to amend, modify or terminate any term and
condition of employment including, without limitation, any employee benefit
plan, program, policy, practice or arrangement or the compensation or working
conditions of JandL Employees.

8.06. _Insurance_. Kennametal agrees to cooperate with Buyer and JandL, as may
be reasonably necessary, in order to make available to JandL any existing
occurrence-based insurance coverage held by Kennametal on which JandL is a
named insured relating to occurrences prior to Closing (the "Kennametal
Policies"). In the event of an occurrence which JandL believes may be covered
by one or more Kennametal Policies, JandL shall, after consultation with
Kennametal, submit a claim for such occurrence to the appropriate insurer
under the applicable Kennametal Policy. Kennametal agrees to provide such
reasonable assistance as JandL may require in order to pursue such claim with
the insurer, including, if necessary, acting as the direct contact for all
purposes with such insurer and pursuing such claim on behalf of JandL; provided,
however, that Kennametal shall not be required to incur any out-of-pocket
costs or expenses.

  

8.07. _Tax Returns_.

  

### (a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed in a timely manner all Tax Returns for JandL for all taxable periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Periods"). Any
such Tax Returns filed between the date hereof and the Closing Date for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be prepared, and each item thereon treated,
in a manner consistent with past practices (including, without limitation,
prior Tax elections and accounting methods or conventions), except as
required by a change in the applicable Law.

  

### (b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for JandL for all taxable periods beginning before and
ending after the Closing Date ("Straddle Periods") which are filed after the
Closing Date. All such Tax Returns with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods
with respect to which Seller has agreed to indemnify Buyer pursuant to
Section 10.02 shall be prepared and filed in a manner that is consistent with
past practices (including, without limitation, prior Tax elections and
accounting methods or conventions), except as required by a change in the

unreserved Taxes of JandL for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and any pre-Closing

the Closing Date and any post-Closing portion of a Straddle Period.

  

### (d) Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each
other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to JandL (including, without limitation, access to books
and records, employees, contractors and representatives) as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election
related to Taxes, the preparation for and conduct of any audit by any Tax
authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding
relating to any Tax Return.  Such cooperation and information shall include
providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with
accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings
or other determinations by Tax authorities at the sole cost of the requesting
party. If reasonably requested by Buyer, Seller shall make a representative
available on a basis mutually convenient to both parties to provide
explanations of any documents or information provided hereunder. Buyer and
Seller shall retain all books and records with respect to Taxes pertaining to
JandL in their respective possession until the later of (i) the expiration of
the statute of limitations of the Tax periods to which such Tax Returns and
other documents relate, without regard to

### 

  

### extensions except to the extent notified by the other party in writing of
such extensions for the respective Tax periods prior to such expirations, and
(ii) six years following the due date (without extension) for such Tax
Returns. At the end of such period, each party shall provide the others with
at least ten days prior written notice before destroying any such books and
records, during which period the parties receiving such notice can elect to
take possession, at their own expense, of such books and records. Buyer and
Seller (and Kennametal) shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any
audit or other proceeding related to Taxes involving JandL. Any information
provided or obtained under this Section 8.07 shall be kept confidential
except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

  

### (e) Seller will pay all applicable transfer Taxes, sales and/or use
Taxes, real property transfer or excise Taxes, recording, deed, stamp and
other similar Taxes, fees and duties imposed under applicable Law upon Seller
incurred in connection with the transfer of the Shares.

they will report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner
consistent with the terms of this Agreement, and all parties agree to file
their Tax Returns accordingly.

member (the "Seller Consolidated Group") shall jointly make an election under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any corresponding or similar elections
under state and/or local Law with respect to the Shares in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 8.08.  JandL shall be included in the
federal consolidated and the applicable state consolidated or combined Tax
Returns filed by Seller Consolidated Group for the taxable period ending on
the Closing Date.

  

### (b) Buyer and Seller Consolidated Group shall report the transactions
being undertaken pursuant to this Agreement in a manner consistent with the

cooperation of Seller Consolidated Group, shall be responsible for the
preparation of two copies of all forms and documents required in connection
with the Section 338(h)(10) election (including Internal Revenue Service Form
8023). Buyer, with the assistance and cooperation of Seller Consolidated
Group, shall prepare the documents and forms as may be required by applicable
Tax Laws and shall deliver two copies of such forms and documents to Seller
not later than 15 days before the required filing date. Seller shall execute
both copies and timely file one copy of such forms and documents with Seller
Consolidated Group federal income Tax Return and shall promptly return the
other copy to Buyer for timely filing with the Internal Revenue Service
Director or other appropriate official or office. To the extent possible,
such forms shall be prepared for execution by the Closing Date.

  

### (c) As soon as reasonably practicable, Buyer and Seller shall mutually
agree and jointly allocate the consideration payable at the Closing (the
"Purchase Price Allocation") in the manner required by Code Sections 338 and
1060. Following such allocation, any subsequent adjustments shall be
reflected in the Purchase Price Allocation as revised hereunder in a manner
consistent with Code Sections 338 and 1060 and as agreed to by Seller and
Buyer at the time of the applicable adjustment (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld). Buyer and Seller

election, and shall take no positions contrary thereto unless there is a
determination (when the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code) contrary
thereto.

  

### (d) To the extent permitted by state or local Tax Laws, the principles
and procedures of this Section 8.08 shall also apply with respect to a
Section 338(h)(10) election under state and local Law. Buyer and Seller
Consolidated Group shall join in making any election similar to the Section
338(h)(10) election which is optional under any state or local Law so as to
treat the transactions contemplated as a sale of assets for state and local
Tax purposes.

### (a) _De finition_. As used herein, "Third Party Claim" means a Loss or
potential Loss for which indemnification is claimed by the Buyer or
Seller (the "Claimant") under the provisions of this Article X and which is

Seller and Kennametal on the other hand (the "Indemnifying Party"), by a
Person by commencement against the Claimant of a legal action or proceeding
or receipt by the Claimant of an assertion of a claim for which
indemnification is provided pursuant to this Article X.

  

### (b) _Notice of Clai m_.  In the event that the Claimant seeks

provided (including, but not limited to, Section 10.03(d)(ii) hereof), the
Indemnifying Party may engage counsel to defend a Third Party Claim, by
providing notice to the Claimant not later than fifteen (15) business days
following delivery by the Claimant to the Indemnifying Party of a notice of a
Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party will cause such counsel to consult
with the Claimant as appropriate, as to the defense of such claim, and the
Claimant may, at its own expense, participate in such defense, assistance or
enforcement but if such election is made the Indemnifying Party shall
control such defense, assistance or enforcement. The Indemnifying Party will
cause such counsel so engaged to keep the Claimant, as appropriate, informed
at all times of the status of such defense, assistance or enforcement.

  

### (d) _Employment of Counsel by the Claimant_.

  

###### (i) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.03(c), the Claimant
shall have the right to engage counsel and to control the defense of a Third
Party Claim if the Indemnifying Party shall not have notified Buyer of their
appointment of counsel and control of the defense of a Third Party Claim
pursuant to Section 10.03(c) within the time period therein provided or if
the Indemnifying Party fails to diligently contest the Third Party Claim.
The Claimant shall, in such case, cause counsel to consult with the
Indemnifying Party as to the conduct of such defense.

  

###### (ii) Notwithstanding the engagement of counsel by the
Indemnifying Party, the Claimant shall have the right, at its own expense,
to engage counsel to participate jointly with the Indemnifying Party in the
defense of a Third Party Claim if (x) the Third Party Claim involves remedies
other than monetary damages and such remedies, in the Claimants
reasonable judgment, could have an adverse effect on the conduct of the
Claimants business, or (y) the Third Party Claim relates to acts, omissions,
conditions, events or other matters occurring after the Closing Date as well
as to acts, omissions, conditions, events or other matters occurring prior
to the Closing Date or (z) the Third Party Claim involves a claim by the Buyer
for monetary damages and the amount claimed is either subject to the Sellers
Floor or in excess of the Sellers Cap.

  

###### (iii) If the Claimant chooses to exercise its right to appoint counsel
under this Section 10.03(d), the Claimant shall deliver notice thereof to
the Indemnifying Party setting forth in reasonable detail why it believes
that it has such right and the name of the counsel it proposes to employ.
The Claimant may deliver such notice at any time that the conditions to the
exercise of such right appear to be fulfilled, it being recognized that in
the course of litigation, the scope of litigation and the amount at stake
may change. The Claimant shall thereupon have the right to appoint such
counsel.

  

### (e) _Settle ment of Third Party Claims_.

###### Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article X.

  

###### (ii) The Indemnifying Party will not enter into a settlement of a
Third Party Claim which involves a non-monetary remedy or which will not be
paid entirely by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article X or if
such settlement does not include an unconditional release of the Claimant
from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of the claim
without the written consent of the Claimant, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  

###### (iii) The Claimant will not enter into a settlement of a Third
Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless the Claimant agrees not to
seek indemnification for such claim.

  

###### (iv) As to any Third Party Claim of the type described in
subsection (ii)(y) or subsection (ii)(z) of Section 10.03(d), the Claimant
and the Indemnifying Party shall consult as to any proposed settlement. If
the Claimant notifies the Indemnifying Party that it wishes to accept a
proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party is unwilling to do so, if the
amount for which the Third Party Claim is ultimately resolved is greater than
the amount for which the Claimant desired to settle, then (x) the Claimant
shall be liable only for the amount, if any, which it would have paid had the
Third Party Claim been settled as proposed by the Claimant, and (y) all
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and costs of suit incurred by the
Claimant subsequent to the time of the proposed settlement shall be paid or
reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party.

  

###### (v) In determining whether to accept or reject any settlement proposal,
each party shall act in good faith and with due regard for the reasonable
commercial and financial interests of the other.

  

### (f) _Cooperation, etc_. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with one another
in good faith in connection with the defense, compromise or settlement of any
claim or action. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the party
controlling the defense or settlement of any matter shall take steps
reasonably designed to ensure that the other party and its counsel are
informed at all times of the status of such matter. Neither party shall
dispose of, compromise or settle any claim or action in a manner that is not
reasonable under the circumstances and in good faith.

### 

  

### 53   

     
   

  

### 

  

### provided that, this Article X shall not be the exclusive remedy for
claims made after Closing (i) based on the willful misconduct on the part of
a party or (ii) for material breach of Articles IV, V, VI and VIII hereunder
if and only if and to the extent that the party in material breach took an
action or failed to take an action within its control that resulted in the
material breach and the material breach was not cured within five (5)
business days after written notice specifying the material breach was
delivered by the non-breaching party to the party in material breach.

  

### (b) In the event that a Party is required to indemnify the other Party
pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled to recover such indemnity payments from unrelated third parties
(including, without limitation, manufacturers, vendors and other suppliers,
but specifically excluding the indemnified Partys insurers).

  

### (c) In the event that (i) the Closing does not occur due to the failure
of any condition precedent contained in Section 7.01 hereof or for any other
reason or (ii) Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(b) or
Section 9.01(d) or otherwise, then Seller, Kennametal and Kennametals

material breach of Articles IV, V, VI or VIII and the material breach was not
cured within five (5) business days after written notice specifying the
material breach was delivered by MSC to Kennametal.  In the event that the
Closing does not occur because Seller, Kennametal or JandL shall have taken any
action or omitted to take any action within its control that resulted in a
material breach of Articles IV, V, VI or VIII and the material breach was not
cured within five (5) business days after written notice specifying the
material breach was delivered by MSC to Kennametal, then Buyer shall be
entitled to all damages remedies permitted under applicable laws.

  

### (d) It is expressly understood and agreed that nothing contained herein
shall be deemed to waive or limit the Parties rights to obtain equitable
relief and/or specific performance including, without limitation, the right
to obtain one or more temporary or permanent injunctions; provided however
that this exception for equitable relief or injunctions does not include or
permit the awarding of any damages or other monetary amounts in addition to
the amounts, if any, permitted by subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this
section.

Mail or similar overnight courier service which provides evidence of
delivery, or (iii) when five (5) days have elapsed after its transmittal by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested,
addressed to the party to whom directed at that partys address as it
appears below or another address of which that party has given notice,
or (iv) when transmitted by telex (or equivalent service), the sender having

contained herein (the "Obligations"). In the event of a default in
performance of any of the Obligations by Seller, Kennametal shall timely
perform or cause to be performed such Obligations in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement including upon receipt of written notice of such
default by Seller to the extent such notice is required to be given to Seller
hereunder. This is a guaranty of payment and performance, and not merely of
collection.  Buyer may collect such amounts, or any part thereof, or
obtain such performance from Kennametal without first exercising its
rights against Seller. Kennametal waives any right it may have to
require that any action be brought against Seller. Kennametal (i) waives
notice of acceptance of this guaranty; and (ii) waives presentment, demand,
notice of dishonor, protest and notice of protest.

  

### (b) Guaranty of MSC. MSC hereby guarantees to Seller the complete and

accordance with the terms of this Agreement including upon receipt of written
notice of such default by Buyer to the extent such notice is required to be
given to Buyer hereunder. This is a guaranty of payment and performance, and
not merely of collection.  Seller may collect such amounts, or any part
thereof, or obtain such performance from MSC without first exercising its
rights against Buyer. MSC waives any right it may have to require that any
action be brought against Buyer.  MSC (i) waives notice of acceptance of this
guaranty; and (ii) waives presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest
and notice of protest.

  

11.13 _Certain Attorney/Client Matters_. The Parties understand and agree
that Kennametal and Seller will be entitled to retain the services of
Buchanan Ingersoll PC ("BIPC") and the legal department of Kennametal as their
attorneys in the event of any dispute between Buyer and/or JandL and Seller
and/or Kennametal concerning this Agreement or any of the other agreements
or documents delivered in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby or whether otherwise involving JandL
notwithstanding any result of BIPCs prior representation of JandL.
Notwithstanding the sale of the Shares to Buyer, Buyer agrees that neither
JandL nor Buyer shall have the right to assert or to waive (and Buyer shall not
assert or waive and shall cause JandL not to assert or waive) the
attorney/client privilege as to pre-closing and post-closing communications
between or among Seller, Kennametal or JandL (for JandL only with respect to
pre-closing communications), on the one hand, and its counsels (including
BIPC or any member of the legal department of Kennametal) on the other hand,
to the extent that the privileged communications relate to this Agreement or
any of the other agreements or documents delivered in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Parties
agree that only Seller or Kennametal shall be entitled to assert or to waive
such attorney/client privilege in connection with such communications
following the Closing of this Agreement; it being the intention of the
Parties hereto that all such rights to such attorney/client privilege and to
control such attorney/client privilege shall be retained by Seller and
Kennametal. The files generated and maintained by BIPC or Kennametals legal
department as a result of the representation of Seller or any representation
of JandL in connection with this Agreement or any of the agreements or documents
delivered in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any efforts to sell the Shares to Buyer or
any other Person shall be and become the exclusive property of Seller
and Kennametal. Nothing in this Section 11.13 shall be construed as a waiver
of any attorney/client privilege.
