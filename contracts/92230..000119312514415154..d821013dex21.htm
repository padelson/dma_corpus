-vii- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November 11, 2014 (this "
_Agreement_ "), by and between BBandT Corporation, a North Carolina corporation
(" _Parent_ "), and Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation
(" _Susquehanna_ ").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and Susquehanna have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for herein, pursuant to which Susquehanna will, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Parent (the " _Merger_
"), so that Parent is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in the
Merger; and

 

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement
is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the North Carolina Business Corporation Act (the " _NCBCA_ ")
and the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the " _PBCL_ "), at
the Effective Time, Susquehanna shall merge with and into Parent. Parent
shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its
corporate existence under the laws of the State of North Carolina. Upon
consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Susquehanna
shall terminate.

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New
York City time, at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, on a date
which shall be no later than three (3) business days after the satisfaction
or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions
set forth in Article VII hereof (other than those conditions that by their
nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless another date, time or place is agreed
to in writing by Parent and Susquehanna. The date on which the Closing occurs
is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
on or before the Closing Date, Parent and Susquehanna, respectively, shall
cause to be filed a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of North Carolina (the " _North Carolina Secretary_ ") and articles of
merger with the Pennsylvania Department of State (the " _Pennsylvania
Department_ ") (collectively, the " _Certificates of Merger_ "). The Merger
shall become effective as of the date and time specified in the Certificates
of Merger (such date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the
NCBCA and the PBCL.

1.5 _Conversion of Susquehanna Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Susquehanna
or the holder of any of the following securities:

 

(a) Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the common stock, par value $2.00
per share, of Susquehanna issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Susquehanna Common Stock_ "), except for shares of
Susquehanna Common Stock owned by Susquehanna as treasury stock or owned by
Susquehanna or Parent (in each case other than shares of Susquehanna Common
Stock (i) held in any Susquehanna Benefit Plans or related trust accounts,
managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary
or agency capacity and (ii) shares held, directly or indirectly, in respect
of a debts previously contracted (collectively, the " _Exception Shares_ ")),
shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Agreement, into the right to receive, without interest, (i) 0.253 shares (the
" _Exchange Ratio_ ") of the common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of
Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") and (ii) $4.05 in cash (the " _Per
Share Cash Consideration_ ") (the consideration described in clauses (i) and
(ii), the " _Merger Consideration_ "); it being understood that upon the
Effective Time, pursuant to Section 1.6, the Parent Common Stock, including
the shares issued to former holders of Susquehanna Common Stock as Merger
Consideration, shall be the common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) All of the shares of Susquehanna Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an " _Old Certificate_ ",
it being understood that any reference herein to " _Old Certificate_ " shall
be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to
the ownership of shares of Susquehanna Common Stock) previously representing
any such shares of Susquehanna Common Stock shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) cash in lieu of
fractional shares which the shares of Susquehanna Common Stock represented by
such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to
this Section 1.5 and Section 2.2(e), without any interest thereon and (iii)
any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.2. Old Certificates previously representing
shares of Susquehanna Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates or,
at Parents option, evidence of shares in book entry form (collectively
referred to herein as " _New Certificates_ "), representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash as set forth in Section 1.5(a) (together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of
fractional shares issued in consideration therefor) upon the surrender of such
Old

 



-2-  Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest thereon.
If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
or Susquehanna Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, or changed
into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities, in
any such case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other

Option Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that the exercise price and the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Susquehanna Stock Option shall

the Code and, in the case of Susquehanna Stock Options that are intended to
qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Code, consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code. Each such
Susquehanna Stock Option as so assumed and converted shall continue to have,
and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applicable

Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction
granted under a Susquehanna Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (a " _Susquehanna Restricted Stock Award_ ") shall fully
vest and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to

(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of
shares of Susquehanna Common Stock granted under a Susquehanna Stock Plan that

Restricted Stock Unit Award_ " and, together with the Susquehanna Stock
Options and the Susquehanna Restricted Stock Awards, the " _Susquehanna Equity
Awards_ ") shall fully vest (and with respect to any Susquehanna Restricted
Stock Unit Award that vests, in whole or in part, based on the achievement of
(i) a profit trigger, achievement of such profit trigger shall be deemed
satisfied and (ii) a specified level of performance, such performance shall be
deemed satisfied at the greater of (x) actual performance as reasonably
determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of
Susquehanna (the " _Compensation Committee_ ") prior to the Effective Time
based on performance through a day that is no more than five (5) business
days prior to the Effective Time and (y) the target level of 100%) and shall
be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable (but no later than five (5) business days) after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest (or, to the extent such
Susquehanna Restricted Stock Unit Award is deferred compensation subject to
Section 409A of the Code, at the earliest time permitted under the
applicable Susquehanna Stock Plan that will not trigger a tax or penalty
under Section 409A of the Code) equal to the Per Susquehanna Share Cash

of each share of Susquehanna Common Stock underlying such Susquehanna
Restricted Stock Unit Award.

provisions of this Section 1.7. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
assume all the obligations of Susquehanna under each Susquehanna Stock Plan
under which a Susquehanna Stock Option is outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, each outstanding Susquehanna Stock Option and the
agreements evidencing the grants thereof, and the number and kind of shares
available for issuance under each such Susquehanna Stock Plan shall be
adjusted to reflect shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions of the applicable Susquehanna Stock Plan. On or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall reserve for future issuance a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock that will be subject to Susquehanna Stock Options as a result of
the actions contemplated by Section 1.7(a). As of the Effective Time, Parent
shall file a post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 or an effective
registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Susquehanna Stock Options,
shall distribute a prospectus relating to such Form S-8, if applicable, and
Parent shall use reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statement for so long as such Susquehanna Stock Options
(as converted) remain outstanding.

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

2.1 _Parent to Make Shares Available_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to Susquehanna (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, for
exchange in accordance with this Article II, (a) New Certificates to be
issued pursuant to Section 1.5 and exchanged pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in
exchange for outstanding shares of Susquehanna Common Stock, and (b) cash in
an amount sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate cash portion of the Merger
Consideration and (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and
New Certificates described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto (after giving effect to
Section 6.10), being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed
by Parent, provided that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect
the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Old Certificates.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.

 

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares
of Susquehanna Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have
been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Old Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and
the cash portion of the Merger Consideration which the shares of Susquehanna
Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall
have been converted into the right to

 



-6-  receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions
to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b). From and after the Effective Time, upon
proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or
Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as
applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder of Susquehanna Common Stock shall
have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a
check representing the amount of (A) the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II, (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has
the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates
surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and (C) any
dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive
pursuant to this Section 2.2, and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on the cash portion of the Merger Consideration or any cash in lieu
of fractional shares payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Old Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated
by this Section 2.2.

 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until
the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with
this Article II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with
this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon,
which theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of
Parent Common Stock which the shares of Susquehanna Common Stock represented
by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive (after
giving effect to Section 6.10).

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to
be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or
Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by
an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Parent
Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Susquehanna of the shares of Susquehanna Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented
for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or
distributions that the holder presenting such Old Certificates is entitled to,
as provided in this Article II.

 



-7- (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable
on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of Susquehanna
who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in
cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average
of the closing-sale prices of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. (the " _NYSE_ ") as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for
the five (5) full trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date
(the " _Parent Share Closing Price_ ") by (ii) the fraction of a
share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of
Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 1.5.

 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Susquehanna for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholders of Susquehanna
who have not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates pursuant to this
Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment
of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any
unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in
respect of each former share of Susquehanna Common Stock such shareholder
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Susquehanna,
the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be
liable to any former holder of shares of Susquehanna Common Stock for any
amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

(g) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the cash portion of the
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 or
any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Susquehanna Common Stock or Susquehanna Equity Awards such amounts
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as
the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Susquehanna Common Stock in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be.

(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



-8- ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SUSQUEHANNA

 

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Susquehanna to
Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Susquehanna Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Susquehanna Disclosure Schedule as an exception to
a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Susquehanna
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this Article III
shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this Article
III specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of
this Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (ii) as
disclosed in any Susquehanna SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof (but
disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Susquehanna hereby
represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) Susquehanna is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is a bank
holding company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (" _BHC Act_ ") that has elected to be treated as financial holding
company under the BHC Act. Susquehanna has the corporate power and authority
to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted. Susquehanna is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Susquehanna. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ "
means, with respect to Parent, Susquehanna or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties,
assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such
party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that,
with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed
to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory
accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules
or regulations of general applicability to companies in the industries in
which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by
courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in
global, national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of
war or acts

 



-9-  of terrorism) or in economic or market conditions affecting the financial
services industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or its
Subsidiaries, (D) failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings projections or
internal financial forecasts, but not including the underlying causes thereof;
(E) disclosure or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
actions expressly required by this Agreement in contemplation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (F) actions or omissions taken pursuant
to the written consent of Parent, in the case of Susquehanna, or Susquehanna,
in the case of Parent; except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B), or (C),
to the extent that the effects of such change are materially
disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities,
results of operations or financial condition of such party and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the
industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability
of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As
used in this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to
any party, means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, bank
or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is
consolidated with such party for financial reporting purposes. True and
complete copies of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of
Susquehanna (the " _Susquehanna Articles_ ") and the Amended and Restated By-
Laws of Susquehanna (the " _Susquehanna Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by Susquehanna to
Parent.

(b) Each Subsidiary of Susquehanna (a " _Susquehanna Subsidiary_ ") (i) is
duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept
is recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Susquehanna and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own
or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of
Susquehanna to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case of a
Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends
or distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The
deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of Susquehanna that is an insured
depository institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund (as defined
in Section 3(y) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950) to the fullest
extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in
connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the
termination of such insurance are pending or, to Susquehannas knowledge,
threatened. Section 3.1(b) of the Susquehanna Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true and complete list of all Subsidiaries of Susquehanna as of the date
hereof.

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Susquehanna consists of 400,000,000 shares
of Susquehanna Common Stock, par value $2.00 per share, and 5,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, without par value, of which no shares of preferred stock
are issued or outstanding. As of the date of this Agreement, no shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of Susquehanna are issued, reserved
for issuance or outstanding, other than (i) 181,645,654 shares of Susquehanna
Common Stock issued and 181,276,704 shares of

 



-10-  Susquehanna Common Stock outstanding, which number includes 9,832 shares of
Susquehanna Common Stock granted in respect of outstanding Susquehanna
Restricted Stock Awards, (ii) 368,950 shares of Susquehanna Common Stock held
in treasury, (iii) 3,636,999 shares of Susquehanna Common Stock reserved for
issuance upon the exercise of outstanding Susquehanna Stock Options and (iv)
1,430,558 shares of Susquehanna Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the
settlement of outstanding Susquehanna Restricted Stock Unit Awards (of which,
838,810 shares of Susquehanna Common Stock are subject to Susquehanna
Restricted Stock Unit Awards subject to a specified level of performance,
assuming maximum performance). All of the issued and outstanding shares of
Susquehanna Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no
personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No bonds, debentures,
notes or other indebtedness that have the right to vote on any matters on
which shareholders of Susquehanna may vote are issued or outstanding. Except
as set forth in Section 3.2(a) of the Susquehanna Disclosure Schedule, as of
the date of this Agreement, no trust preferred or subordinated debt securities
of Susquehanna are issued or outstanding. Other than the Susquehanna Equity
Awards, in each case, issued prior to the date of this Agreement, there are
no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights,
exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or agreements
obligating Susquehanna to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any such securities.

(b) There are no voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies or other
agreements in effect pursuant to which Susquehanna or any of the Susquehanna
Subsidiaries has a contractual or other obligation with respect to the voting
or transfer of the Susquehanna Common Stock or other equity interests of
Susquehanna. Section 3.2(b) of the Susquehanna Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a true, correct and complete list of all Susquehanna Equity Awards outstanding
as of the date hereof specifying, on a holder-by-holder basis, (A) the name of
each holder, (B) the number of shares subject to each such Susquehanna Equity
Award, (C) the grant date of each such Susquehanna Equity Award, (D) the
Susquehanna Stock Plan under which such Susquehanna Equity Award was granted,
(E) the exercise price for each such Susquehanna Equity Award that is a
Susquehanna Stock Option, and (F) the expiration date of each such Susquehanna
Equity Award that is a Susquehanna Stock Option. Other than the Susquehanna
Equity Awards, no equity-based awards (including any cash awards where the
amount of payment is determined in whole or in part based on the price of any
capital stock of Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries) are outstanding.

 

(c) Susquehanna owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests
of each of the Susquehanna Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens,
pledges, charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_
"), and all of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized
and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to
Susquehanna Subsidiaries that are insured depository institutions, as provided
under 12 U.S.C. § 55 or any comparable provision of applicable state law) and
free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof. No Susquehanna Subsidiary has or is bound by any
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or
agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any
shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any
securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares
of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary.

 



-11- 3.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) Susquehanna has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of Susquehanna.
The Board of Directors of Susquehanna has determined that the Merger, on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the best interests of
Susquehanna and has directed that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby be submitted to Susquehannas shareholders for adoption at
a meeting of such shareholders and has adopted a resolution to the foregoing
effect. Except for the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of
the holders of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the votes which
all Susquehanna shareholders are entitled to cast on the matter (the "
_Requisite Susquehanna Vote_ "), and the adoption and approval of the Bank
Merger Agreement by the board of directors of Susquehanna Bank and Susquehanna
as its sole shareholder, no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Susquehanna are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Susquehanna and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent) constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Susquehanna, enforceable against Susquehanna in
accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting insured depository institutions or the rights of creditors generally
and subject to general principles of equity (the " _Enforceability
Exceptions_ ")).

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Susquehanna nor
the consummation by Susquehanna of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by Susquehanna with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i)
violate any provision of the Susquehanna Articles or the Susquehanna Bylaws
or (ii) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in
Section 3.4 are duly obtained and/or made, (x) violate any law, statute, code,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction
applicable to Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets or (y) violate, conflict with, result in a
breach of any provision of or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a
default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a right of
termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or
assets of Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of
trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to
which Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or
any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case
of clause (ii) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults,

issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and
the approval of the listing of such Parent Common Stock on the NYSE, no
consents or approvals of or filings or registrations with any court
or administrative agency or commission or other governmental authority or
instrumentality or SRO (each a " _Governmental Entity_ ") are necessary in
connection with (A) the execution and delivery by Susquehanna of this
Agreement or (B) the consummation by Susquehanna of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Bank Merger). As used in this
Agreement, " _SRO_ " means (i) any "self regulatory organization" as defined
in Section 3(a)(26) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
_Exchange Act_ ") and (ii) any other United States or foreign securities
exchange, futures exchange, commodities exchange or contract market. As of
the date hereof, Susquehanna is not aware of any reason why the necessary
regulatory approvals and consents will not be received in order to permit
consummation of the Merger and Bank Merger on a timely basis.

 

3.5 _Reports_.

(a) Susquehanna and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed (or furnished,
as applicable) all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file (or furnish, as applicable) since January 1, 2011 with (i) any state
regulatory authority, (ii) the SEC, (iii) the Federal Reserve Board, (iv) the
FDIC, (v) any foreign regulatory authority and (vi) any SRO ((i) 
(vi), collectively " _Regulatory Agencies_ "), including any report,
registration or statement required to be filed (or furnished, as applicable)
pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations of the United States, any state,
any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the failure
to file such report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and
assessments, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Susquehanna. Except for
examinations of Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory
Agency in the ordinary course of business, no Regulatory Agency has initiated
or has pending any

 



-13-  proceeding or, to the knowledge of Susquehanna, investigation into the
business or operations of Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries since January
1, 2011, except where such proceedings or investigation would not reasonably
be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Susquehanna. There is no unresolved violation, criticism, or
exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement
relating to any examinations or inspections of Susquehanna or any of its
Subsidiaries, which would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Susquehanna.

 

(b) An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2011 (the " _Susquehanna SEC
Reports_ ") is publicly available. No such Susquehanna SEC Report, at the time
filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of registration statements
and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the
relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that
information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this
Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of
their respective dates, all Susquehanna SEC Reports filed or furnished under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of
Susquehanna has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of
him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date
of this Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or
material unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the
Susquehanna SEC Reports.

3.6 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The financial statements of Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Susquehanna SEC Reports (including the
related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in
accordance with, the books and records of Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries,
(ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results
of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders equity and consolidated
financial position of Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries for the respective
fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the
case of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature
and amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the
SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv)
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in
the notes thereto. The books and records of Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries
have been, since January 1, 2011, and are being, maintained in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not resigned (or informed
Susquehanna that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public
accountants of Susquehanna as a result of or in connection with any
disagreements with Susquehanna on a matter of accounting principles
or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 



-14- (b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Susquehanna, neither
Susquehanna nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due
or to become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or
reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Susquehanna included in
its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30,
2014 (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since September 30,
2014, or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Susquehanna and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Susquehanna or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Susquehanna.
Susquehanna (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to Susquehanna, including its Subsidiaries, is
made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
Susquehanna by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (ii) has disclosed, based on
its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Susquehannas outside
auditors and the audit committee of Susquehannas Board of Directors (x) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Susquehannas
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and
(y) to the knowledge of Susquehanna, any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Susquehannas internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures
were made in writing by management to Susquehannas auditors and audit
committee and a copy has been previously made available to Parent. To the
knowledge of Susquehanna, there is no reason to believe that Susquehannas
outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
will not be able to give the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

 

(d) Since January 1, 2011, (i) neither Susquehanna nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of Susquehanna, any director, officer,
auditor, accountant or representative of Susquehanna or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or, to the
knowledge of Susquehanna, oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Susquehanna or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective

 



-15-  internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or written claim that Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no
attorney representing Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by Susquehanna or any of its officers, directors or employees to the
Board of Directors of Susquehanna or any committee thereof or to the knowledge
of Susquehanna, to any director or officer of Susquehanna.

 

3.7 _Broker s Fees_. Neither Susquehanna nor any Susquehanna Subsidiary nor
any of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder
or financial advisor or incurred any liability for any brokers fees,
commissions or finders fees in connection with the Merger or related
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than Keefe, Bruyette and
Woods, Inc. pursuant to a letter agreement, a true and complete copy of which
have been previously provided to Parent.

 

3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since December 31, 2013, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Susquehanna.

(b) Since December 31, 2013, except with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby or as required or permitted by this
Agreement, Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective
businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course.

 

3.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

 

(a) Neither Susquehanna nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and
there are no pending or, to Susquehannas knowledge, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental
or regulatory investigations of any nature against Susquehanna or any of its
Subsidiaries (i) that would reasonably be likely to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Susquehanna, or (ii) of a
material nature challenging the validity or propriety of this Agreement.

 

(b) There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory
restriction imposed upon Susquehanna, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets
of Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the
Merger, would apply to the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates).

 

3.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Each of Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (taking
into account all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all
jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects.
Neither Susquehanna nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return. All material
Taxes of

 



-16-  Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Returns)
that are due have been fully and timely paid. Each of Susquehanna and its
Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have been
withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee,
creditor, shareholder, independent contractor or other third party. Neither
Susquehanna nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver
of the limitation period applicable to any material Tax that remains in
effect. The federal income Tax Returns of Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries for
all years up to and including December 31, 2010 have been examined by
the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") or are Tax Returns with respect
to which the applicable period for assessment under applicable law, after
giving effect to extensions or waivers, has expired. No deficiency with
respect to a material amount of Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed
against Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no pending or
threatened in writing disputes, claims, audits, examinations or other
proceedings regarding any material Taxes of Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries
or the assets of Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries. In the last six years,
neither Susquehanna nor any of its Subsidiaries has been informed in writing
by any jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that Susquehanna or any of
its Subsidiaries was required to file any Tax Return that was not filed.
Susquehanna has made available to Parent true, correct, and complete copies of
any private letter ruling requests, closing agreements or gain
recognition agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed in the
last six years. There are no Liens for material Taxes (except Taxes not yet
due and payable) on any of the assets of Susquehanna or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither Susquehanna nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or
arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between
or among Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries). Neither Susquehanna nor any of
its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent
of which was Susquehanna) or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any
person (other than Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither
Susquehanna nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two years
or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related transactions)" within
the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part,
a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock
intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code.
Neither Susquehanna nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a "listed
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4(b)(2). At no time during the past five years has Susquehanna been a
United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section
897(c)(2) of the Code. Neither Susquehanna nor any of its Subsidiaries will be
required to include any material item of income in, or to exclude any material
item of deduction from, taxable income in any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any (i) change in method
of accounting, (ii) closing agreement, (iii) intercompany transaction or
excess loss account described in Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of
the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (iv)
installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the
Closing Date, or (v) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date,
in the case of (i), (iii), (iv) and (v), outside of the ordinary course of
business.

(b) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Tax_ " or " _Taxes_ " means all
federal, state, local, and foreign income, excise, gross receipts, ad valorem,

3.11 _Employees_.

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the Susquehanna Disclosure Schedule lists all material
Susquehanna Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Susquehanna

_ERISA_ ")), whether or not subject to ERISA, and all bonus, stock option,
stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred compensation, retiree
medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement or other benefit plans,

Affiliate_ "), is a party or has any obligation or that are maintained,
contributed to or sponsored by Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Susquehanna ERISA Affiliate for the benefit of any current or former
employee, officer, director or independent contractor of Susquehanna or any of
its Subsidiaries or any Susquehanna ERISA Affiliate.

 

(b) Susquehanna has heretofore made available to Parent true and complete
copies of each of the Susquehanna Benefit Plans and the following related
documents, to the extent applicable: (i) the most recent copy of any summary
plan descriptions, amendments, modifications or material supplements
applicable to any Susquehanna Benefit Plan, (ii) the annual report (Form
5500), if any, filed with the IRS for the last two completed plan years,
(iii) the most recently received IRS determination or opinion letter, if any,
relating to a Susquehanna Benefit Plan, and (iv) the most recently prepared
actuarial report for each Susquehanna Benefit Plan (if applicable).

(c) Each Susquehanna Benefit Plan has been established, operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the
requirements of all applicable laws, including ERISA and the Code, except as
would not result in any material liability. Neither Susquehanna nor any of its
Subsidiaries has, within the prior three years, taken any action to take
corrective action or make a filing under any voluntary correction program of
the IRS, Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect to
any Susquehanna Benefit Plan, and neither Susquehanna nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any plan defect that would qualify for
correction under any such program.

 



-18- (d) Section 3.11(d) of the Susquehanna Disclosure Schedule identifies each
Susquehanna Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code (the " _Susquehanna Qualified Plans_ "). The IRS has issued
a favorable determination or opinion letter with respect to each Susquehanna
Qualified Plan and the related trust, which letter has not been revoked (nor
has revocation been threatened in writing), and, to the knowledge of
Susquehanna, there are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred
that would have a material adverse effect on the qualified status of any
Susquehanna Qualified Plan or the related trust or increase the costs relating
thereto. No trust funding any Susquehanna Benefit Plan is intended to meet the
requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

 

(e) Each Susquehanna Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) and any
award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code,
has (i) since January 1, 2005, been maintained and operated, in all material
respects, in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS
Notice 2005-1 and (ii) since January 1, 2009, been, in all material respects,
in documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(f) With respect to each Susquehanna Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV

plan is in "at-risk" status for purposes of Section 430 of the Code, (ii) no
reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the
30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred, (iii) all
premiums required to be paid to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the
" _PBGC_ ") have been timely paid in full, (iv) no liability (other than for
premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be
incurred by Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries, and (v) the PBGC has not
instituted proceedings to terminate any such Susquehanna Benefit Plan.

 

(g) None of Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries nor any Susquehanna ERISA
Affiliate has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been
obligated to contribute to any plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a plan
that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under
common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple
Employer Plan_ "), and none of Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries nor any
Susquehanna ERISA Affiliate has incurred any material liability to a
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan as a result of a complete or
partial withdrawal (as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan that
has not been satisfied in full.

(h) Neither Susquehanna nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored or
has any obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that provides
for any material post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life
insurance benefits for retired or former employees or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

(i) All material contributions required to be made to any Susquehanna Benefit
Plan by applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all material premiums due or payable with respect to
insurance policies funding any Susquehanna

hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required
to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on
the books and records of Susquehanna.

(j) There are no pending or, to Susquehannas knowledge, material threatened
(in writing) claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course),
lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, to
Susquehannas knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that may
reasonably be likely to give rise to a material claim or lawsuit, against the
Susquehanna Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their
duties to the Susquehanna Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts
under any of the Susquehanna Benefit Plans, that could in any case reasonably
be likely to result in any material liability of Susquehanna or any of its
Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the IRS, the Department of Labor, any Multiemployer
Plan, a Multiple Employer Plan, any participant in a Susquehanna Benefit
Plan, or any other party.

(k) None of Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries nor any Susquehanna ERISA
Affiliate nor, to Susquehannas knowledge, any other person, including any
fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section
4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could subject any of the
Susquehanna Benefit Plans or their related trusts, Susquehanna, any of its
Subsidiaries, any Susquehanna ERISA Affiliate or any person that Susquehanna
or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any material tax
or material penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of
ERISA.

(l) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery
of, or material increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or
other benefit to any employee, officer, director or other service provider of
Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the
form of benefits) by Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof
or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will
be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code.

(m) No Susquehanna Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of
Taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code, or otherwise. Susquehanna has
made available to Parent preliminary copies of Section 280G calculations with
respect to any executive officers of Susquehanna who are disqualified
individuals in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

(n) There are no pending or, to Susquehannas knowledge, threatened (in
writing) material labor grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or
charges against Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or
other material labor disputes against Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries.
Neither Susquehanna nor any of its Subsidiaries are party to or bound by any
collective bargaining or similar agreement with any labor organization, or
work rules or practices agreed to with any labor organization or
employee association applicable to employees of Susquehanna or any of its
Subsidiaries and, to Susquehannas knowledge, there are no organizing efforts
by any union or other group seeking to represent any employees of Susquehanna
or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



-20- 3.12 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Susquehanna and each of its
Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times since December 31, 2011 held, all
licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their respective
properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all
fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where
neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such
license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees
or assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Susquehanna, and to the knowledge
of Susquehanna no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license,
franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Susquehanna and each of its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are not in
material default or violation under any law, statute, order, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to Susquehanna or any of its
Subsidiaries, including (to the extent applicable to Susquehanna or its
Subsidiaries) all laws related to data protection or privacy, the USA PATRIOT

Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment
or understanding (whether written or oral), other than any Susquehanna Benefit
Plan (i) that is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item
601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (ii) that contains a non-compete or
client or customer non-solicit requirement or any other provision that
materially restricts the conduct of any line of business by Susquehanna or any
of its Subsidiaries or upon consummation of the Merger will materially
restrict the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
to engage in any line of business that is material to Susquehanna and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) with or to a labor union or guild
(including any collective bargaining agreement) or (iv) that grants any right
of first refusal, right of first offer or similar right with respect to any
material assets, rights or properties of Susquehanna or its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of
the type described in this Section 3.13(a), whether or not set forth in the
Susquehanna Disclosure Schedule, is referred to herein as a " _Susquehanna
Contract_ ," and neither Susquehanna nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or
has

 



-21-  received written, or to Susquehannas knowledge, oral notice of, any
violation of the above by any of the other parties thereto which would
reasonably be likely to be, either individually or in the aggregate, material
to Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b) In each case, except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either

adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its credit or risk management
policies, its management or its business (each, whether or not set forth in
the Susquehanna Disclosure Schedule, a " _Susquehanna Regulatory Agreement_
"), nor has Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries been advised in writing or,

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to
Susquehanna concurrently herewith (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the
related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the
mere inclusion of an item in the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to
a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Parent that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect,
and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this Article IV
shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this Article IV
specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of this
Article IV to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (ii) as
disclosed in any Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof
(but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Parent hereby
represents and warrants to Susquehanna as follows:

(a) Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of North Carolina and is a bank holding
company duly registered under the BHC Act that has elected to be treated as
financial holding company under the BHC Act. Parent has the corporate power
and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted. Parent is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such

 



-29-  licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. True and
complete copies of the Parent Articles and Parent Bylaws, as in effect as of
the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by Parent to
Susquehanna.

 

(b) Each Subsidiary of Parent (a " _Parent Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of

recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing

in which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent
and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. There are
no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of Parent to pay dividends or
distributions except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity,

shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of Parent Bank,

its shareholders. Except for the adoption and approval of the Bank Merger
Agreement by the board of directors of Parent Bank and Parent as its sole
shareholder, and the adoption of resolutions to give effect to the provisions
of Section 6.11 in connection with the Closing, no other corporate proceedings
on the part of Parent are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Parent and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Susquehanna) constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms
(except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by the
Enforceability Exceptions). The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger have been validly authorized and, when issued, will be validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and no current or past shareholder of
Parent will have any preemptive right or similar rights in respect thereof.

assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in Section 4.4
are duly obtained and/or made, (x) violate any law, statute, code, ordinance,

with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under,
result in the termination of or a right of termination or cancellation under,
accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the respective properties or assets of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or
other instrument or obligation to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may
be bound, except (in the case of clause (ii) above) for such violations,
conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations or
creations which either individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably
be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

4.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (i) the filing of applications,
filings and notices, as applicable, with the Federal Reserve Board under the
BHC Act and approval of such applications, filings and notices, (ii) the

the NYSE, no consents or approvals of or filings or registrations with any
Governmental Entity are necessary in connection with (A) the execution and
delivery by Parent of this Agreement or (B) the consummation by Parent of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the Bank
Merger). As of the date hereof, Parent is not aware of any reason why the
necessary regulatory approvals and consents will not be received in order to
permit consummation of the Merger and Bank Merger on a timely basis.

 



-32- 4.5 _Reports_.

 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed or furnished, as
applicable) all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file (or furnish, as applicable) since January 1, 2011 with any Regulatory
Agencies, including any report, registration or statement required to be
filed (or furnished, as applicable) pursuant to the laws, rules or
regulations of the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or any
Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report,
registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Except for examinations of Parent and its
Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of
business, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or,
to the knowledge of Parent, investigation into the business or operations of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2011, except where such
proceedings or investigation would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. There
is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency
with respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations or
inspections of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, which would reasonably be
likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.

(b) An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2011
(the " _Parent SEC Reports_ ") is publicly available. No such Parent SEC
Report, at the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except
that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of
this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.
As of their respective dates, all Parent SEC Reports filed or furnished under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Parent
has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her
under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or material unresolved
issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Parent SEC Reports.

4.6 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations,
cash flows, changes in shareholders equity and consolidated financial
position of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or
as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited
statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii)
complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all

 



-33-  material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the
notes thereto. The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been,
since January 1, 2011, and are being, maintained in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not resigned (or informed Parent
that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public
accountants of Parent as a result of or in connection with any disagreements
with Parent on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due),
except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on
the consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in its Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2014 (including any notes
thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since September 30, 2014, or in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent
(i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to
the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by
others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
Parents outside auditors and the audit committee of Parents Board of
Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (y) to the knowledge of Parent, any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Parents internal controls over financial reporting. These
disclosures were made in writing by management to Parents auditors and audit
committee and a copy has been previously made available to Susquehanna. To
the knowledge of Parent, there is no reason to believe that Parents outside
auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not
be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due.

 



-34- (d) Since January 1, 2011, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any director, officer, auditor, accountant
or representative of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of Parent, oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-
offs and accruals) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or written claim that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged
in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no
attorney representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by Parent or any of its officers, directors or employees to the
Board of Directors of Parent or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of
Parent, to any director or officer of Parent.

 

4.7 _Broker s Fees_. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary nor any of
their respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or
financial advisor or incurred any liability for any brokers fees, commissions
or finders fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

4.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since December 31, 2013, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

(b) Since December 31, 2013, except with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby or as required or permitted by this
Agreement, Parent and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective
businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course.

 

4.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

 

(a) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there
are no pending or, to Parents knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory
investigations of any nature against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (i)
that would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, or (ii) of a material
nature challenging the validity or propriety of this Agreement.

 

(b) There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory
restriction imposed upon Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger,
would apply to Parent or any of its affiliates).

 

4.10 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
hold, and have at all times since December 31, 2011 held, all licenses,
franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties,
rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where neither
the cost of

 



-35-  failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such license,
franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or
assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and to the knowledge of
Parent, no suspension or cancellation or any such necessary license,
franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Parent and each of
its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are not in
material default or violation under any, law, statute, order, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including (to the extent applicable to Parent or its
Subsidiaries) all laws related to data protection or privacy, the USA PATRIOT

other law relating to bank secrecy, discriminatory lending, financing or
leasing practices, money laundering prevention, Sections 23A and 23B of the
Federal Reserve Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and all agency requirements
relating to the origination, sale and servicing of mortgage and consumer
loans. Each of Parents Subsidiaries that is an insured depository institution
has a Community Reinvestment Act rating of "satisfactory" or better.

4.11 _Certain Contracts_.

 

(a) Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written
or oral) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item

Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is bound
as of the date hereof has been filed as an exhibit to the most recent Annual

Current Report on Form 8-K subsequent thereto (each, a " _Parent Contract_ "),
and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received
notice of, any violation of any Parent Contract by any of the other parties
thereto which would reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

(b) In each case, except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either

each Parent Contract is valid and binding on Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect, (ii) Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries has performed all obligations required to be

Parents knowledge each third-party counterparty to each Parent Contract has

of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under any such Parent Contract.

Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement

subject to any order or directive by, or has been ordered to pay any civil
money penalty by, or has been since January 1, 2011, a recipient of any
supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 2011, has adopted any policies,
procedures or board resolutions at the request or suggestion of any Regulatory
Agency or other Governmental Entity that currently restricts in any material
respect the conduct of its business or that in any material manner relates to
its capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its credit or risk
management policies, its management or its business (each, whether or not set
forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule, a " _Parent Regulatory Agreement_ "),
nor has Parent or any of its Subsidiaries been advised in writing or, to
Susquehannas knowledge, orally, since January 1, 2011, by any Regulatory

404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act.

the Code.

option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other similar derivative

of Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the ordinary course
of business and in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and policies
of any Regulatory Agency and with counterparties believed to be financially

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

6.1 _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Parent and Susquehanna shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC, no
later than 30 days after of the date of this Agreement, the Proxy Statement
and Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the S-4, in which the
Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of Parent and
Susquehanna shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such
filing, and Susquehanna shall thereafter mail or deliver the Proxy Statement
to its shareholders. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals
required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
Susquehanna shall furnish all information concerning Susquehanna and the
holders of Susquehanna Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action.

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the
terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all such third parties and Governmental Entities.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable and
in no event later than thirty (30) business days after the date of this
Agreement, Parent and Susquehanna shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, each prepare and file any applications, notices and filings
required in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals. Parent and
Susquehanna shall each use, and shall each cause their applicable
Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to obtain each such Requisite
Regulatory Approval as promptly as reasonably practicable. The parties shall
cooperate with each other in connection therewith (including the furnishing
of any

 



-43-  information and any reasonable undertaking or commitments that may be
required to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals). Parent and Susquehanna
shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable,
each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to
Susquehanna or Parent, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. Each party will provide the other with copies of any
applications and all correspondence relating thereto prior to filing, other
than any portions of material filed in connection therewith that contain
competitively sensitive business or other proprietary information filed under
a claim of confidentiality. The parties hereto agree that they will consult
with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Each
party shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference
with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
Susquehanna shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of,
or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of businesses or assets of Parent, Susquehanna and their
respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Parent or
Susquehanna to take, or agree to take, any actions specified in this Section
6.1 that would reasonably be likely to have a material and adverse effect on
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, giving effect to the Merger
(measured on a scale relative to Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole) (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

(d) Parent and Susquehanna shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent,
Susquehanna or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and Susquehanna agrees, as to
itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement and each
amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy Statement and any

 



-44-  amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to shareholders
and at the time of Susquehannas meeting of its shareholders to consider and
vote upon approval of this Agreement, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which such statement was made, not misleading. Each of Parent and
Susquehanna further agrees that if it becomes aware that any information
furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect
to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other
party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement.

(e) Parent and Susquehanna shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed.

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Parent and
Susquehanna, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties
of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated
by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
advisors and other representatives of the other party, access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its
properties, books, contracts, personnel, information technology systems, and
records, and each shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to
execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and
business operations generally (including by entering into customary
confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements with such service
providers and/or the other party), and, during such period, each of Parent and
Susquehanna shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make
available to the other party such information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request. Each party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with
the other partys regular business operations during any such access. Neither
Parent nor Susquehanna nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Parents or Susquehannas,
as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of
the institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due
consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or
similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) Each of Parent and Susquehanna shall hold all information furnished by or
on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated September 12, 2014, between Parent and Susquehanna (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



-45- (c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

6.3 _Susquehanna Shareholder Approval_.

 

(a) Susquehanna shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the
Susquehanna Articles and Susquehanna Bylaws, all action necessary to convene
a meeting of its shareholders (the " _Susquehanna Meeting_ ") to be held as
soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the
purpose of obtaining the Requisite Susquehanna Vote required in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger, and, if so desired and
mutually agreed, upon other matters of the type customarily brought before an
annual or special meeting of shareholders to adopt a merger agreement. The
Board of Directors of Susquehanna shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain from the shareholders of Susquehanna the Requisite Susquehanna Vote,
including by communicating to its shareholders its recommendation (and
including such recommendation in the Proxy Statement) that they adopt and
approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Susquehanna
shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to Parent to assist in
the solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating to the
Requisite Susquehanna Vote. However, subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2,
if the Board of Directors of Susquehanna, after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, determines in good faith that it would more likely than not result
in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to
recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to its
shareholders, the Board of Directors of Susquehanna may submit this Agreement
to its shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving
this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in
which event the Board of Directors of Susquehanna may communicate the basis
for its lack of a recommendation to its shareholders in the Proxy Statement or
an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law;
_provided_ that the Board of Directors of Susquehanna may not take any
actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives Parent at least five (5)
business days prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a
reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its
determination to take such action (including, in the event such action is
taken by the Board of Directors of Susquehanna in response to an Acquisition
Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions and the identity of the
third party in any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or
modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or
circumstances) and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the Board of
Directors of Susquehanna takes into account any amendment or modification to
this Agreement proposed by Parent and after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless more likely than
not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to
continue to recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new notice period as referred
to in this Section 6.3.

 



-46- (b) Susquehanna shall adjourn or postpone the Susquehanna Meeting, if, as of
the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are
insufficient shares of Susquehanna Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting, or if on the date of such meeting Susquehanna has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the
Requisite Susquehanna Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the
Susquehanna Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to
the shareholders of Susquehanna at the Susquehanna Meeting, for the purpose of
voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters
contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
Susquehanna of such obligation. Susquehanna shall only be required to adjourn
or postpone the Susquehanna Meeting three times pursuant to the first sentence
of this Section 6.3(b). 

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of
this Agreement, each of Parent and Susquehanna shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by Susquehanna or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
continuing employees of Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries with (i) annual base
salary or wages that are no less than the annual base salary or wages in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) annual incentive
opportunities, long-term incentive compensation opportunities, and employee
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided
to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries; _provided_
that Parent may satisfy its obligation under this Section 6.6(a)(ii) for a
transitional period by providing such compensation and employee benefits on
terms that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided by
Susquehanna and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. For
a period beginning at the Effective Time and continuing through the first
anniversary thereof, Parent or its Subsidiaries shall provide severance
payments and benefits to each continuing employee of Susquehanna and its
Subsidiaries that are no less favorable than the severance payments and
benefits provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries to their similarly situated
employees.

 



-47- (b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
in which any employees of Susquehanna or its Subsidiaries become eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) waive all pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible
dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing
conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous
Susquehanna Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such employee and their eligible
dependents with credit for any co-payments or coinsurance and deductibles paid
prior to the Effective Time under a Susquehanna Benefit Plan (to the same
extent that such credit was given under the analogous Susquehanna Benefit Plan
prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-
payment, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket requirements under any New
Plans and (iii) recognize all service of such employees with Susquehanna and
its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such
service was taken into account under the analogous Susquehanna Benefit Plan
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing service
recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication
of benefits for the same period of services, (B) for purposes of any defined
benefit pension plan or benefit plan that provides retiree welfare benefits,
or (C) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered
benefits.

 

(c) The Surviving Corporation agrees to assume and honor all Susquehanna
Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as of the date hereof or as
modified consistent with the terms of this Agreement, it being understood that
this sentence shall not be construed to limit the ability of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Affiliates to amend or terminate any Susquehanna
Benefit Plan to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the
terms of the applicable plan.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation,
Susquehanna, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with
or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Susquehanna,
Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the
services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of Susquehanna or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i)
establish, amend, or modify any Susquehanna Benefit Plan, New Plan or any
other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii)
alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular
Susquehanna Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting
the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.11, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
person, including any current or former employee, officer, director or
consultant of Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 



-48- 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, each present and former director, officer or employee of Susquehanna and
its Subsidiaries or fiduciaries of Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries
under Susquehanna Benefit Plans (in each case, when acting in such
capacity) (collectively, the " _Susquehanna Indemnified Parties_ ") against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising
before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to, (i) the fact that such person is or was a director, officer,
employee or fiduciary of Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii)
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including
matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred
by such Susquehanna Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law; _provided_ that the Susquehanna Indemnified Party to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary
form) to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Susquehanna Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in
effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by Susquehanna ( _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are
no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the
present and former officers and directors of Susquehanna or any of its
Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 250% of the
aggregate annual premium paid as of the date hereof by Susquehanna for such
insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance
would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which provide the maximum
coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of
the foregoing, Susquehanna, in consultation with, but only upon the consent
of Parent, may (and at the request of Parent, Susquehanna shall use its
reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-
year "tail" policy under Susquehannas existing directors and officers
insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the
preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an
amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Susquehanna Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns, consolidates with
or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity
of such consolidation or merger, transfers all or substantially all of its
assets

 



-49-  or deposits to any other entity or engages in any similar transaction, then
in each case, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will
expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7. For the
avoidance of doubt, to the extent required by any agreement previously entered
into by Susquehanna in connection with a merger, acquisition or other
business combination, the provisions of this Section 6.7 shall apply to
directors, officers, employees and fiduciaries of predecessor entities
previously acquired by Susquehanna or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Susquehanna under
this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified in a manner so as to
adversely affect any Susquehanna Indemnified Party or any other person
entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.7 without the prior written consent
of the affected Susquehanna Indemnified Party.

 

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the
parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be
taken, all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by the other
party, at the expense of the party who makes any such request.

 

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Parent and Susquehanna shall each promptly advise the
other party of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it (i) that
has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or
(ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article
VII; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance with the
foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a
violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this
Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the
underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied.

 

6.10 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Susquehanna shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends
in respect of Parent Common Stock and Susquehanna Common Stock and the record
dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
parties hereto that holders of Susquehanna Common Stock shall not receive two
dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to
their shares of Susquehanna Common Stock and any shares of Parent Common Stock
any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

 

6.11 _Corporate Governance; Community Commitment_.

 

(a) Parent shall take all appropriate action so that, as of the Effective
Time, the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of Parent
and Parent Bank shall be increased by two and William J. Reuter and Christine
Sears shall be appointed as directors of Parent. William J. Reuter and
Christine Sears shall serve in such roles subject to the policies of Parent
generally applicable to the Board of Directors, including Parents Corporate
Governance Guidelines and the Director Resignation Policy set forth therein.

 



-50- (b) At or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall invite members
of the Board of Directors of Susquehanna (other than those individuals
specified in Section 6.11(a)) to serve as members of one or more regional
advisory boards in accordance with the terms set forth in Section 6.11 of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule.

 

(c) On the Closing Date, Parent shall create a charitable foundation, or
support an existing charitable foundation acceptable to Susquehanna, in
Pennsylvania dedicated to providing ongoing economic development support to
the Lancaster County, Pennsylvania community. On the Closing Date, Parent or
Susquehanna shall contribute to the foundation an amount in cash equal to
$10,000,000. Parent, in consultation with Susquehanna, to the extent
practicable, will designate individuals located in the Lancaster County,
Pennsylvania area to serve as trustees of the foundation prior to Closing.

 

(d) Following the Effective Time, Parent will use its reasonable best efforts
to support a continued meaningful employee presence in Lancaster County,
Pennsylvania.

6.12 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Susquehanna shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with
respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person
concerning or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data
to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to,
any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that, prior to receipt of
the Requisite Susquehanna Vote, in the event Susquehanna receives an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit
its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or
cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such
negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors
concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel,
and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure
to take such actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided
pursuant to the foregoing proviso, Susquehanna shall have provided such
information to Parent, and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement
with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than
the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not
provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Susquehanna.
Susquehanna will, and will cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted
before the date of this Agreement with any person other than Parent with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Susquehanna will promptly (and in any
event within one (1) business day) advise Parent following receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and
conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal), and will promptly (and in any event within one (1)
business day) advise Parent of any related developments, discussions and
negotiations on a

 



-51-  current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such
inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. Susquehanna shall use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to
which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms
thereof. Unless this Agreement is contemporaneously terminated in accordance
with its terms, Susquehanna shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives not to
on its behalf, enter into any binding acquisition agreement, merger agreement,
or other definitive transaction agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with this Section
6.12(a)) relating to any Acquisition Proposal). As used in this Agreement, "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any offer or proposal relating to, or any third party
indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or
indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Susquehanna and its
Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
Susquehanna or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of Susquehanna,
(ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in
such third party beneficially owning more than 25% of any class of equity or
voting securities of Susquehanna or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the
consolidated assets of Susquehanna, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange or other business combination involving Susquehanna or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 25% of the consolidated assets of Susquehanna, except, in each case, any
sale of whole loans and securitizations in the ordinary course of business and
any _bona fide_ internal reorganization.

 

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Susquehanna or its Board
of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such Rules will
in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 

6.13 _Public Announcements_. Susquehanna and Parent shall each use their
reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to
ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement required
by (i) applicable law or regulation, (ii) a request by a Governmental Entity
or (iii) an obligation pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange, Susquehanna and Parent agree to consult with each other
and to obtain the advance approval of the other party (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press
release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.14 _Change of Method_. Parent may at any time change the method of
effecting the Merger (including by providing for the merger of Susquehanna
with a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent) if and to the extent requested by
Parent, and Susquehanna agrees to enter into such amendments to
this Agreement as Parent may reasonably request in order to give effect to
such restructuring; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change or amendment
shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration
provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of
the Merger with respect to Susquehannas shareholders or (iii) be reasonably
likely to cause the Closing to be materially delayed or the receipt of the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals to be prevented or materially delayed.

 



-52- 6.15 _Restructuring Efforts_. If Susquehanna shall have failed to obtain the
Requisite Susquehanna Vote at the duly convened Susquehanna Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith
use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the
transaction provided for herein ( _provided_ , _however_ , that no party
shall have any obligation to agree to (i) alter or change any material term of
this Agreement, including the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration, in a
manner adverse to such party or its shareholders or (ii) adversely affect the
Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to Susquehannas shareholders) and/or
(in the case of Susquehanna) resubmit this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.15) to its
shareholders for approval or adoption.

6.16 _Takeover Statutes_. Neither Parent nor Susquehanna shall take any
action that would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and each of Parent and Susquehanna shall take all necessary steps to exempt
(or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in
effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable
to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and Susquehanna will
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate
or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the
validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

6.17 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Susquehanna and Parent
agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers
and directors of Susquehanna subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Susquehanna Insiders_ "), both prior to and
after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Susquehanna Insiders not be
subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion
of shares of Susquehanna Common Stock and Susquehanna Equity Awards in the
Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the
provisions of this Section 6.17. The Board of Directors of Parent and of
Susquehanna, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term
is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall
promptly, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as
may be necessary or appropriate to cause (i) any dispositions of Susquehanna
Common Stock or Susquehanna Equity Awards and (ii) any acquisitions of Parent
Common Stock and/or Susquehanna Stock Options exercisable for shares of Parent
Common Stock converted at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.7(a), in
each case, pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by
any Susquehanna Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be
officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, to be exempt from
liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law.

 



-53- 6.18 _Litigation and Claims_. Each of Parent and Susquehanna shall promptly
notify each other in writing of any action, arbitration, audit, hearing,
investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced,
brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving, any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or
Susquehanna, as applicable, threatened against Parent, Susquehanna or any of
their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be
expected to question the validity of this Agreement, the Bank Merger
Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any
actions taken or to be taken by Parent, Susquehanna or their respective
Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or
otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Susquehanna shall give Parent the opportunity to participate at its own
expense in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against
Susquehanna and/or its directors or affiliates relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed without
Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 

6.19 _Assumption of Susquehanna Debt_. Parent agrees to execute and deliver,
or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving
Company, at or prior to the Effective Time, one or more supplemental
indentures, guarantees, and other instruments required for the due assumption
of Susquehannas outstanding debt, guarantees, securities, and other
agreements to the extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees,
securities, and other agreements.

6.20 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of Susquehanna or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give
Susquehanna, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of Parent or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to
the Effective Time, each of Parent and Susquehanna shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

are de minimis) in each case as of the date of this Agreement and (except to

of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date, and
the representations and warranties of Susquehanna set forth in Sections

made on and as of the Closing Date. All other representations and warranties
of Susquehanna set forth in this Agreement (read without giving effect to any

lead in to Article III) shall be true and correct in all respects as of the
date of this Agreement and (except to the extent such representations and
warranties speak as of an earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made

and correct unless the failure or failures of such representations and
warranties to be so true and correct, either individually or in the aggregate,

to effect the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction, or waiver by
Susquehanna, at or prior to the Effective Time, of the following conditions:

 

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
Parent set forth in Section 4.2(a) and Section 4.8 (in each case, after

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

8.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
shareholders of Susquehanna:

 

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and Susquehanna in a written instrument;

 

(b) by either Parent or Susquehanna if any Governmental Entity that must grant
a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the Bank
Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable
order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, unless
the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe
the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

(c) by either Parent or Susquehanna if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement
(the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by
such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party
set forth herein;

(d) by either Parent or Susquehanna ( _provided_ , that the terminating party
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of
the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or
any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of Susquehanna, in the case of a termination by Parent,
or Parent, in the case of a termination by Susquehanna, which breach or
failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other
breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to
be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date,
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, as the
case may be, and which is not cured within the earlier of the Termination Date
and 45 days following written notice to Susquehanna, in the case of a
termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by
Susquehanna, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period; or

 



-57- (e) by Parent, if (i) prior to such time as the Requisite Susquehanna Vote is
obtained, Susquehanna or the Board of Directors of Susquehanna (A) submits
this Agreement to its shareholders without a recommendation for approval, or
otherwise withdraws or materially and adversely modifies (or discloses its
intention to withdraw or materially and adversely modify) its recommendation
as contemplated by Section 6.3(a), or recommends to its shareholders an
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger, or (B) materially breaches its
obligations under Section 6.3 or Section 6.12; or (ii) a tender offer or
exchange offer for 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Susquehanna Common
Stock is commenced (other than by Parent or a Subsidiary thereof), and the
Board of Directors of Susquehanna recommends that the shareholders of
Susquehanna tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise
fails to recommend that such stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange
offer within the 10 business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d) or (e) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such termination
to the other party in accordance with Section 9.5, specifying the provision or
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected.

 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or
Susquehanna as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and none of Parent, Susquehanna, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 3.3(a),
3.7, 4.3(a), 4.7, 6.2(b), this Section 8.2 and Article IX shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Parent nor Susquehanna shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud
or willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement (which, in
the case of Susquehanna, shall include the loss to the holders of Susquehanna
Common Stock of the economic benefits of the Merger, including the loss of the
premium offered to the shareholders of Susquehanna).

 

(b) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to senior management of
Susquehanna or shall have been made directly to its shareholders generally or
any person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Susquehanna and (A) thereafter this Agreement
is terminated by either Parent or Susquehanna pursuant to Section 8.1(c)
without the Requisite Susquehanna Vote having been obtained or (B) thereafter
this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d), and (C)
prior to the date that is fifteen (15) months after the date of such
termination, Susquehanna enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a
transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same
Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then Susquehanna shall, on
the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date
of consummation of such

 



-58-  transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to
$85,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ , that for purposes of
this Section 8.2(b), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
to "25%" shall instead refer to "50%".

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(e), then Susquehanna shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same
day funds, the Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably practical after the
date of termination (and, in any event, within three (3) business days
thereafter).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum aggregate
amount of fees payable by Susquehanna under this Section 8.2 shall be equal to
the Termination Fee.

 

(d) Each of Parent and Susquehanna acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Susquehanna fails promptly to pay
the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against
Susquehanna for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, Susquehanna shall
pay the costs and expenses of Parent (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Susquehanna fails
to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then Susquehanna
shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of
the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and
ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a
rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co.
or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was
required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by Susquehanna
pursuant to Section 8.2(b) constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty,
and, except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct, shall be the sole
monetary remedy of Parent in the event of a termination of this Agreement
specified in such section.

 

ARTICLE IX

GENERAL PROVISIONS 

9.1 _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements_. None of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in
any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement (other than the

this Agreement by the shareholders of Susquehanna, there may not be, without
further approval of

 



-59-  such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires further

drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an
Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
