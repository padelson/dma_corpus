automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and  no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (c) Conversion of
Company Common Stock. The consideration for each  issued and outstanding
share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to  be canceled in
accordance with Section 3.1(b) and the Appraisal Shares)  shall be an amount
in cash equal to (i) $242,000,000 less the aggregate  amount of Company Debt
as set forth in the Payoff Certificates divided by  (ii) 994,066 (the "Merger
Consideration"). Each issued and outstanding  share of Company Common Stock
(other than shares to be canceled in  accordance with Section 3.1(b) and the
Appraisal Shares) shall be converted  into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash, without  interest. At the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Common Stock  shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and  retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate  (collectively, the "Stockholders") which immediately
prior to the Effective  Time represented any such shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a  "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except  the right to receive the Merger Consideration.   3.2
Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(c), but
instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. At the Effective
Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the   10   foregoing,
if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw
or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holder\'s Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease
and each such Appraisal Share shall be deemed to have been converted at
the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(c). The Company shall serve
prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.   3.3 Merger
Consideration Adjustment.   (a) As promptly as practicable, but no later
than sixty (60) days  after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to  the Stockholder Representative the Closing
Statement (as defined below) and  a certificate based on such Closing
Statement setting forth Parent\'s  calculation of Closing Working Capital.
The closing statement (the "Closing  Statement") shall present the Net
Working Capital as of the end of business  on the Closing Date plus all cash
and cash equivalents held by the Company  and its Subsidiaries at the end of
business on the Closing Date ("Closing  Working Capital"). "Net Working
Capital" means the Current Assets, reduced  by the Current Liabilities, in
each case as determined in accordance with  GAAP. The preparation of the
Closing Statement shall be for the sole  purpose of calculating the Net
Working Capital as of the end of business on  the Closing Date. The Net
Working Capital as of the end of business on the  Closing Date shall be
calculated in the same manner as the calculation of  Net Working Capital as
of September 30, 2004, set forth on Schedule 3.3(a)  attached hereto.   (b)
If the Stockholder Representative disagrees with Parent\'s  calculation of
Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section  3.3(a), the
Stockholder Representative may, within fifteen (15) days after  delivery of
the Closing Statement, deliver a notice to Parent disagreeing  with such
calculation(s) and setting forth the Stockholder Representative\'s 
calculation of such amount(s). Any such notice of disagreement shall  specify
those items or amounts as to which the Stockholder Representative  disagrees,
and the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have  agreed with all
other items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement  and the
calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to  Section 3.3(a).
Net Working Capital shall be calculated expressly for this  purpose in
Dollars, with any amounts in other currencies converted to  Dollars based on
the Applicable Exchange Rate as of the Closing Date.   (c) If a notice of
disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to  Section 3.3(b), the
Stockholder Representative and Parent shall, during the  fifteen (15) days
following such delivery, use their commercially  reasonable efforts to reach
agreement on the disputed items or amounts in   11   1    order to
determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing Working  Capital. If
during such period, the Stockholder Representative and Parent  are unable to
reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause a  mutually
satisfactory independent nationally recognized accounting firm  (the
"Accounting Referee") to review the relevant portions of this  Agreement and
the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating  Closing Working
Capital (it being understood that in making such  calculation(s), the
Accounting Referee shall be functioning as an expert  and not as an
arbitrator). In making such calculation(s), the Accounting  Referee shall
consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Statement  and Parent\'s
calculation of Closing Working Capital as to which the  Stockholder
Representative has disagreed. The Accounting Referee shall  deliver to the
Stockholder Representative and Parent, as promptly as  practicable (but in
any case no later than thirty (30) days from the date  of engagement of the
Accounting Referee), a report setting forth its  calculation of Closing
Working Capital, which amount shall not be less than  the amount thereof
shown in Parent\'s calculation delivered pursuant to  Section 3.3(a) nor more
than the amount thereof shown in the Stockholder  Representative\'s
calculation delivered pursuant to Section 3.3(b). Such  report shall be final
and binding upon the Stockholders and Parent. The  cost of such review and
report shall be borne one-half by Parent and  one-half by ISH.   (d) The
Stockholder Representative, Parent and the Company shall, and  shall cause
their respective representatives to, cooperate and assist in  the preparation
of the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing  Working Capital and
in the conduct of the review referred to in this  Section 3.3, including the
making available to the extent necessary of  books, records, work papers and
appropriate personnel.   (e) If Final Working Capital exceeds the Target Net
Working Capital,  Parent shall pay to the Stockholders on a pro-rata basis,
in the manner and  with interest as provided in Section 3.3(f), the amount of
such excess and,  if the Target Net Working Capital exceeds Final Working
Capital, ISH shall  pay to Parent the amount of such excess, in the manner
and with interest as  provided in Section 3.3(f). Any such payment shall be
considered to be an  adjustment to the Merger Consideration. "Final Working
Capital" means  Closing Working Capital (i) as shown in Parent\'s calculation
delivered  pursuant to Section 3.3(a) if no notice of disagreement with
respect  thereto is duly delivered pursuant to Section 3.3(b); or (ii) if
such a  notice of disagreement is delivered, (A) as agreed by the
Stockholder  Representative and Parent pursuant to Section 3.3(c) or (B) in
the absence  of such agreement, as shown in the Accounting Referee\'s
calculation  delivered pursuant to Section 3.3(c). ISH hereby agrees to
retain and not  distribute to its limited partners $5,000,000 of the Merger
Consideration  received by it pursuant to Section 3.4(a) until Final Working
Capital has  been so determined and all payments required by ISH, if any,
pursuant to  this Section 3.3 have been made.   (f) Any payment pursuant to
Section 3.3(e) shall be made in Dollars at  a mutually convenient time and
place as soon as practicable, but in no  event less than five (5) Business
Days after Final Working Capital has been  determined, by wire transfer by
Parent or ISH, as the case may be, of  immediately available funds to the
account of such other party as may be  designated in writing by such other
party. The amount of any payment to be  made pursuant to this Section 3.3
shall bear interest from and including   12     the Closing Date to but
excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum  equal to the rate of
interest published from time to time by the Wall  Street Journal as the
"prime rate" at large U.S. money center banks during  the period from the
Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest  shall be payable at the
same time as the payment to which it relates and  shall be calculated daily
on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty  five (365) days and the actual
number of days elapsed.   3.4 Payment of Merger Consideration; Exchange of
Certificates.   (a) Payment. Subject to compliance with Section 3.4(b),
Parent shall  pay to each Stockholder the Merger Consideration in the
aggregate amounts  set forth next to such Stockholder\'s name on Schedule
3.4(a).   (b) Exchange Procedures. Upon surrender of the Certificate or 
Certificates representing the Company Common Stock held by each Shareholder 
to Parent, together with a customary stock power endorsed in blank, at any 
time after the Effective Time, such Stockholder shall be entitled to  receive
the Merger Consideration with respect to such shares and the  Certificate or
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In  the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that  is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the proper amount  of cash
may be paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person  in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such  Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for  transfer and the
Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or  other taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the  registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable  satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.  Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 3.4(b), each Certificate  shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the  right to receive
upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest  will be paid or
will accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any  Certificate.   (c)
No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All cash paid  upon the
surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this  Article 3
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all  rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously  represented by
such Certificates. At the close of business on the day on  which the
Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company  shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on  the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of  Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time. If, at
any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are  presented to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent for any reason, they shall  be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article 3.   (d) No Liability. None of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company shall be  liable to any Person in respect of any
cash delivered to a public official  pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.   13     (e) Lost Certificates. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen  or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person  claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, Parent will  issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger  Consideration for the Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate  to which such holder would be entitled
pursuant to this Article 3.   ARTICLE 4   TERMINATION   4.1 Termination
of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time as follows:   (a) at the election of the Company or Parent on
or after December 30,  2005 (the "Outside Date"), if the Merger shall not
have occurred by the  close of business on such date, provided that the
terminating party is not  in material default of any of its obligations
hereunder, and provided  further that such date shall be automatically
extended for 60 days if only  the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections
9.1(d) and 9.2(d) remain  unsatisfied or unwaived at December 30, 2005;  
(b) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;   (c) by the
Company or Parent if there shall be in effect a final  nonappealable Order
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the  consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; it being agreed that  the parties hereto
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to  promptly appeal any adverse
determination which is not nonappealable and  diligently pursue such
appeal;   (d) by Parent if (i) the Company shall be in material violation of
any  of its obligations hereunder, and if such violation (if curable) is
not  cured within 20 days after the giving of written notice by Parent to
the  Company or (ii) there has been any event, change, occurrence or 
circumstance that renders the conditions set forth in either Section 9.1(a) 
or Section 9.1(g) incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date;   (e) by
the Company if (i) Parent or Merger Sub shall be in material  violation of
any of their obligations hereunder, and if such violation (if  curable) is
not cured within 20 days after the giving of written notice by  the Company
to Parent, or (ii) there shall have been any event, change,  occurrence or
circumstance that has had or reasonably would be expected to  have a material
adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to  consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or   (f) by the Company if
Parent shall have not obtained and delivered to  the Company on or before
10:00 p.m. (New York time) on February 18, 2005  written evidence of the
Parent Board Approval certified by an authorized  officer of Parent.   4.2
Procedure Upon Termination. In the event of termination and abandonment by
Parent or the Company, or both, pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof, written  
14    notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or
parties, and this Agreement shall terminate, and the Merger shall be
abandoned, without further action by Parent or the Company.   4.3 Effect of
Termination. In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with Section 4.1, then each of the parties shall be relieved of
their duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after the date of
such termination and such termination shall be without liability to Parent,
the Merger Sub, the Company or ISH; provided, that no such termination shall
relieve any party hereto from liability for any willful breach of
this Agreement.   ARTICLE 5   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE

refund litigation pending with respect to any Taxes of the Company or any  of
its Subsidiaries and no taxing authority has given written notice of the 
commencement of (or its intent to commence) any audit, examination or 
deficiency litigation with respect to any such Taxes. In respect of any 
ongoing audit, investigation and other proceedings by a tax authority, the

itself  against such action and tax claim and believes that such action and
claim  can be successfully defended based on the filed submissions.   (i)

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the  parties
agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause  to be
taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done as promptly as 
practicable, all things necessary, proper and advisable under applicable 
Laws to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the

parties such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other 
party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.   (b) Each of
the parties shall cooperate with one another and use all  commercially
reasonable efforts to prepare all necessary documentation  (including
furnishing all information required under the Competition Laws  to effect
promptly all necessary filings and to obtain all consents,  waivers and

Agreement. Each party hereto shall provide to the other parties  copies of
all correspondence between it (or its advisors) and any  Governmental
Antitrust Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by  this Agreement
or any of the matters described in this Section 8.4. Each  such party shall
promptly inform the other parties hereto of any oral  communication with, and
provide copies of written communications with, any  Governmental Body
regarding any such filings or any such transaction. No  party hereto shall
independently participate in any formal meeting with any  Governmental Body
in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other  inquiry without
giving the other parties hereto prior notice of the meeting  and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Body, the opportunity to  attend and/or
participate. Subject to applicable Law, the parties hereto   35   will
consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any  analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,  opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party  hereto relating to

any Governmental Antitrust Entity information  and documents requested by any
Governmental Antitrust Entity or necessary,  proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement, including
filing any notification and report form and  related material required under
the HSR Act (and any similar Law enforced  by any Governmental Antitrust

Business Days after the date hereof for  filings required under the HSR Act
and twenty (20) Business Days after the  date hereof for all other filings,
and thereafter to respond promptly to  any request for additional information

of the parties hereto shall use its commercially  reasonable efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted  by any Governmental

commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such  Legal
Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any  decree,
judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary  or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts 
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including 
by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal and 
all available legislative action, unless, by mutual agreement, Parent and 
the Company decide that litigation is not in their respective best 
interests. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its commercially 
reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the 
expiration of the notice periods under the Competition Laws with respect to 
such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this 
Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of 
Parent and the Company agree to use its commercially reasonable efforts to 
take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and 
every impediment under any Competition Laws that may be asserted by any 
Governmental Antitrust Entity, so as to enable the parties to close the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as possible,  in
order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any  decree,
order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other  order in
any suit or preceding, that would otherwise have the effect of  preventing or
materially delaying the consummation of the transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement.   8.5 Further Assurances. Each of Parent and the Company
shall use (and the Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use) its
commercially reasonable   36   efforts to (i) take all actions necessary
or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or 
taken at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time 
prior to the Closing Date. Parent agrees that all rights of the Indemnitees 
to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions 
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as provided in the respective 
certificate of incorporation or by-laws or comparable organizational 
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as now in effect, and 
any indemnification agreements or arrangements of the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full  force
and effect in accordance with their terms. Such rights shall not be  amended,
or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect  the rights
of the Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by Law.  In
addition, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay  or
reimburse any expenses of any Indemnitee under this Section 8.7, as  incurred
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided  that the
person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to  repay such

after the Closing Date, shall cause (i) the  certificate of incorporation and
by-laws or comparable organizational  documents of the Surviving Corporation
to contain provisions no less  favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of certain  liabilities of directors, officers, employees and
agents and  indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in the  certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company and
(ii) the  certificate of incorporation and by-laws or comparable
organizational  documents of each Subsidiary of Parent to contain the current
provisions  regarding indemnification of directors, officers, employees and
agents  which provisions in each case shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise  modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of  the Indemnitees.   37   (c) The Indemnitee shall have the
right (but not the obligation) to  control the defense of, including the
investigation of, any litigation,  claim or proceeding (each, a "Claim")
relating to any acts or omissions  covered under this Section 8.7 with
counsel selected by the Indemnitee;  provided, however, that (i) Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be  permitted to participate in the defense
of such Claim at their own expense  and (ii) Parent shall not be liable for
any settlement effected without its  written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or  delayed.   (d) In the event any Claim is
asserted or made, any determination  required to be made with respect to
whether an Indemnitee\'s conduct  complies with the standards set forth under
applicable Law, the applicable  organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries or any indemnification
agreements or arrangements of the  Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, as the case may  be, shall be made by independent legal
counsel selected by such Indemnitee.   (e) Each of Parent and the Indemnitee
shall cooperate, and cause their  respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the
defense of any Claim and shall  provide access to properties and individuals
as reasonably requested and  furnish or cause to be furnished records,
information and testimony, and  attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or  appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.   (f) The Surviving Corporation shall provide or
maintain in effect for  six (6) years from the Effective Time, through the

corporate liability  insurance covering those individuals who are covered by
the directors\' and  officers\' and corporate liability insurance policy or
policies provided for  directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the date  hereof (the "Existing Policy") on terms (other
than with respect to minimum  aggregate limits of liability for directors\'
and officers\' and corporate  liability insurance coverage) comparable in all
respects to the Existing  Policy and such coverage shall contain minimum
aggregate limits of  liability for directors\' and officers\' and corporate
liability insurance  coverage for directors and officers of the Company and
its Subsidiaries  with the amount of coverage at least equal to that of the
Existing Policy  and deductibles no larger than those customary for such type
of insurance  coverage.   (g) The provisions of this Section 8.7: (i) are
intended to be for the  benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnitee, his or her heirs  and his or her representatives; and (ii) are in
addition to, and not in  substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that  any such person may have by Contract or
otherwise.   (h) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of  their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into  any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation
or  entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all
or  substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and
in  each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and  assigns of Parent shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth
in  this Section 8.7.   38   (i) The obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under this  Section 8.7 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to  adversely affect any Indemnitee to whom this
Section 8.7 applies without  the consent of the affected Indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the  Indemnitees to whom this Section 8.7 applies shall
be third party  beneficiaries of this Section 8.7).   8.8 Preservation of

records and personnel available to the other and to any Stockholder as may be
reasonably required by such party in connection with, among other things, any
insurance claims by, Legal Proceedings or Tax audits against or governmental
investigations of the Stockholders or any of their Affiliates.   8.9
Publicity.   (a) None of the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or ISH shall issue
any press release or public announcement or comment concerning this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written
approval of the other party hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, unless, in the judgment of the Company or Parent,
disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or under the rules of any
securities exchange on which the securities of the Parent are listed,
provided that, to the extent required by applicable Law, the party intending
to make such release shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent
with applicable Law to consult with the other party with respect to the text
thereof. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, no press release shall
issue until after the receipt of the Parent Board Approval.   (b) Each of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and ISH agrees that the terms of this
Agreement shall not be disclosed or otherwise made available to the public

made available to the public, except where such disclosure, availability or
filing is required by applicable Law and only to the extent required by such
Law or under the rules of any securities exchange on which the securities of
the Parent are listed. In the event that such disclosure, availability or
filing is required by applicable Law, each of Parent, the Company agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain "confidential treatment" of
this Agreement and to redact such terms of this Agreement the other party
shall request.   (c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that prior to the

identity of Parent or Merger Sub,   39  the fact that this Agreement has
been signed, or the amount of the Merger Consideration; provided, however,
that nothing herein shall prevent the Company or ISH, during the Standstill
Period, from having discussions with participants in the current auction
process that disclose the fact that the Company has agreed to exclusivity
with a third party. If the Parent Board Approval is received on or prior to
the end of the Standstill Period, the Company and ISH shall terminate the
current auction process concurrent with the press release announcing the
transaction evidenced by this Agreement.   8.10 Use of Name. Parent shall,

basis, to the levels of compensation and  benefits as in effect prior to the
Closing and (ii) provide severance  compensation and benefits to any such
employees whose employment is  terminated during the one-year period
following the Closing Date at levels  at least equivalent to the levels of
such compensation and benefits to  which such employees would have been

Closing. Individuals who continue their  employment with the Companies
following the Closing Date are hereinafter  referred to as the "Continuing
Employees."   (b) For purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit
accrual)  under the employee benefit plans of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation  providing benefits to Continuing Employees (the "Parent Plans"),
Parent and  the Surviving Corporation shall credit each Continuing Employee
with his or  her years of service with such Company, its Subsidiaries and
any  predecessor entities, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee
was  entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for such service
under  any similar Employee Benefit Plan. The Parent Plans shall not deny 
Continuing Employees coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions and 
shall credit such Continuing Employees for any deductibles and  out-of-pocket
expenses paid in the year of initial participation in the  Parent Plans.

reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom enforcement of
any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is sought. No action
taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf
of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking  
44  such action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of
any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a
further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power

exercise of any other right, power or remedy.   10.7 Governing Law. This
Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort)
