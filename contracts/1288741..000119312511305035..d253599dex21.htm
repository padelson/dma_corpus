 _THE OFFER_

 

2.1. _The Offer._

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. As promptly as reasonably practicable (and,
in any event, within 10 Business Days) after the date of this Agreement,
Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to, commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to
purchase all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at a price per
share equal to the Offer Price (as adjusted as provided in  _Section
2.1(c)_, if applicable).

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligations of Acquisition
Sub to, and of Parent to cause Acquisition Sub to, accept for payment, and
pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are
subject to the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (the "Offer
Conditions"). The Offer Conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and
Acquisition Sub, and may be asserted by Parent and Acquisition Sub or waived
by Parent or Acquisition Sub, in whole or in part, at any time and from time
to time, in their sole discretion, other than the Minimum Tender Condition,
which may be waived by Parent and Acquisition Sub only with the prior written
consent of the Company. Parent and Acquisition Sub expressly reserve the right
to increase the Offer Price or to waive or make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless
otherwise provided in this Agreement or previously approved by the Company in
writing, Acquisition Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Acquisition
Sub to, (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the
Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer, (iv) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Tender
Condition, (v) add to the Offer Conditions or amend, modify or supplement any
Offer Condition in a manner adverse to any holder of Company Common Stock,
(vi) terminate the Offer or extend or otherwise amend or modify the
expiration date of the Offer in any manner other than in compliance with the
terms of this Agreement or (vii) provide any "subsequent offering period"

stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and
prior to Acquisition Subs acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Company
Common Stock tendered in the Offer, and such adjustment to the Offer Price
shall provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action; provided that nothing
in this Section 2.1(c) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 



12 (d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. Unless extended as provided in
this Agreement, the Offer shall expire on the date (the "Initial Expiration
Date") that is twenty (20) Business Days (calculated as set forth in Rule

Date or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, any
Offer Condition is not satisfied or, to the extent waivable in accordance with
the terms hereof, has not been waived by Parent or Acquisition Sub,
Acquisition Sub shall, subject to Parents and the Companys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_, extend (and re-extend)
the Offer and its expiration date beyond the Initial Expiration Date for one
or more periods, in consecutive increments of up to ten (10) Business Days
each, the length of each such period to be determined by Parent in its sole
discretion (or such longer period as the Parties hereto may agree), ending no
later than the Outside Date, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied;
_provided_ , _however_ , if, on the Initial Expiration Date or any subsequent
date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, the Minimum Tender
Condition is the only Offer Condition that has not been satisfied or waived
(to the extent waivable in accordance with the terms hereof), Acquisition Sub
shall, subject to Parents right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 10.1_, if requested by the Company in writing, extend the Offer and
its expiration date beyond any then scheduled expiration date for one or more
periods not to exceed an aggregate of twenty (20) Business Days
(the "Extended Expiration Date"), the length of each such period (which is
not to be less than five (5) Business Days) to be determined by Parent in its
sole discretion (or such longer period as the Parties hereto may agree),
ending no later than the Outside Date, to permit the Minimum Tender Condition
to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this
Agreement (including _Annex I_ ) to the contrary, if all of the Offer
Conditions (or all of the Offer Conditions other than the Minimum Tender
Condition) have been satisfied as of 4:01 pm ET on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Initial Expiration Date, (x) the Company shall, upon
the request of Parent, deliver to Parent a certificate, executed on behalf of
the Company by the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of

Sub only with the prior written consent of the Company and (2) the condition
set forth in clause (c)(i) of Annex I) and the Offer shall thereafter be
conditioned only upon the satisfaction of the Minimum Tender Condition and the
condition set forth in clause (c)(i) of Annex I, (B) the termination right of
Parent set forth in _Section 10.1(e)_ and (C) the condition to the Merger set
forth in _Section 9.1(b)_, and (ii) the total, aggregate funds necessary to

aggregate consideration payable in connection with the Offer and the Merger
shall be conditioned only upon the occurrence of the Acceptance Time.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Acquisition Sub shall,
without the consent of the Company, extend the Offer for any period required
by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or
any rule or regulation of Nasdaq, in each case, applicable to the Offer.

promulgated under the Exchange Act. The date of payment for shares of Company

to, (i) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such
termination) terminate the Offer and in any event shall not acquire any

terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1_, to purchase at a price per share equal
to the Offer Price up to a number of newly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Shares") that, when
added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly
owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of the Top-Up Closing (after
giving effect to the Offer Closing), shall constitute one share more than 90%
(determined on a fully diluted basis) of the shares of the Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up may not be exercised (i) to purchase
an amount of Top-Up Shares in excess of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock authorized and unissued (treating shares owned by the Company as
treasury stock as unissued) and not otherwise reserved or committed for
issuance at the time of exercise of the Top-Up, (ii) unless the Offer Closing
shall have occurred and (iii) unless, immediately after such exercise, Parent
and its Subsidiaries would own more than 90% of the Company Common Stock then
outstanding. The Top-Up shall be exercisable only once.

(b) _Exercise of Top-Up; Top-Up Closing_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in _Section 2.3(a)_ and the satisfaction of the conditions to the
Merger, including _Section 9.1(c)_, if there shall not have been validly
tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn that number of shares of
Company Common Stock which, when added to the shares of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries, would represent at least 90% of the
shares of the Company Common Stock outstanding on the Offer Closing Date (the
"Short-Form Threshold"), Acquisition Sub shall exercise the Top-Up for such
number of Top-Up Shares as is necessary for Acquisition Sub to reach the
Short-Form Threshold and on such date shall give the Company prior written
notice specifying the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly or
indirectly owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of such notice
(giving effect to the Offer Closing). The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following receipt of such notice (and in any event no later than
the Offer Closing Date), deliver written notice to Acquisition Sub specifying,
based on the information provided by Acquisition Sub in its notice, the number
of Top-Up Shares to be purchased. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-
Up Shares (the "Top-Up Closing"), which shall take place at the location of
the Merger Closing specified in _Section 3.2_, and shall take place
simultaneously with, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, the Offer
Closing, the purchase price owed by Acquisition Sub to the Company to purchase
the Top-Up Shares shall be paid to the Company, at Acquisition Subs option,
(i) in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, or (ii) by (x) paying in
cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, an amount equal to not less than the
aggregate par value of the Top-Up Shares and (y) executing and delivering to
the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the
aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up less the amount paid in cash
pursuant to the preceding clause (x) (the "Promissory Note"). The Promissory
Note (i) shall be due on the first anniversary of the Top-Up Closing, (ii)
shall bear simple interest of 5% per annum, payable in arrears at maturity,
(iii) shall be full recourse to Parent and Acquisition Sub, (iv) may be
prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, and (v)
shall have no other material terms. At the Top-Up Closing, the Company shall
cause to be issued to Acquisition Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up
Shares.

 



16 (c) _Exemption from Registration_. Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge that
the Top-Up Shares that Acquisition Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-
Up will not be registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in
reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities
Act. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby represents and warrants to the
Company that Acquisition Sub will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares,
an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Acquisition Sub agrees that the Top-Up and the Top-Up Shares
to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up are being and will be acquired by
Acquisition Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of
the Securities Act).

(d) _No Effect on Appraisal Rights_. The Parties agree that any dilutive
impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock as a result of the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares will not be taken into account in any
determination of the fair value of any Appraisal Shares pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 3.7(c)_ and that none of the
Parties shall take any position to the contrary in any appraisal proceeding.

2.4. _Notices of Guaranteed Delivery_ For purposes of this Agreement,
including the exercise of the Top-Up, and the Offer, unless otherwise mutually
agreed to by the Company and Parent, any shares of Company Common Stock
subject to notices of guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be validly
tendered into the Offer unless and until the shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such notices of guaranteed delivery are delivered to or on
behalf of Acquisition Sub.

2.5. _Directors._

(a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_. Effective upon the
Offer Closing and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to
designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on
the Company Board that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors
on the Company Board (giving effect to the election of any additional
directors pursuant to this Section 2.5) and (ii) the percentage that the
number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and/or
Acquisition Sub (including shares accepted for payment) immediately following
the Offer Closing bears to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding (determined on a fully-diluted basis), and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause Parents designees to be elected or appointed
to the Company Board, including by promptly increasing the number of
directors (included by amending the by-laws if necessary to increase the size
of the Company Board) or securing resignations of incumbent directors;
_provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board
shall always have at least two Continuing Directors. For purposes of this
Agreement, any and all members of the Company Board immediately prior to the
Offer Closing who remain on the Company Board after such designation by Parent
pursuant to this  _Section 2.5(a)_ shall be referred to as "Continuing
Directors". If the number of directors who are Continuing Directors is reduced
below two (2) prior to the Effective Time, the remaining Continuing
Director shall be entitled to designate an individual to fill such vacancy
who is not a current or former officer, director, employee or consultant of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Parent Insider_ ") and who shall be
deemed a Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement, and the
Company shall cause such designee to be appointed to the Company Board. If,
notwithstanding compliance with the foregoing provisions, the number of
Continuing Directors is reduced to zero (0), then the other directors on the
Company Board shall designate and appoint to the Company Board two (2)
directors who are not Parent Insiders who shall be deemed Continuing Directors
for all purposes of this Agreement. At such time, the Company shall also
cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members
(rounded up to the next whole number) that in each case represents the same
percentage as such individuals represent on the Company Board on (A) each
committee of the Company Board to the fullest extent permitted by all

 



17  applicable Laws, including the rules of Nasdaq, and (B) as requested by
Parent, on each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each
committee thereof).

 

(b) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ hereof, until the Effective Time,
the Company Board shall have at least such number of directors as may be
required by the rules and regulations of Nasdaq and the federal securities
Laws who are considered independent directors within the meaning of such
rules and Laws ("Independent Directors"); _provided_ , _however_ , that in
such event, if the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below the
number of such directors as may be required by such rules or securities Laws
for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be
entitled to designate Persons to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no
Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall designate such
number of directors as may be required by the rules and regulations of Nasdaq
and the federal securities Laws to be Independent Directors, to fill such
vacancies who shall not be stockholders or Affiliates of Parent or
Acquisition Sub, and such Persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors
for purposes of this Agreement

(c) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligations to use
reasonable best efforts to appoint Parents designees to the Company Board
shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions reasonably
necessary, including mailing to its shareholders information with respect to
the Company and its directors and officers, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1
require in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 2.5(c), which
shall be mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent shall supply to the
Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with respect
to itself and its nominees, directors, officers and affiliates required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 and the Companys obligations under Section
2.5(a) and this  _Section 2.5(c)_ shall be subject to the receipt of such
information.

(d) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Following the election or
appointment of Parents designees pursuant to Section 2.5(a) and until the
Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors (or the
approval of the sole Continuing Director if there shall only be one (1)
Continuing Director then in office) shall be required to authorize (and such
authorization shall constitute the authorization and direction of the full
Company Board and no other action on the part of the Company, including any
action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize)
the Company to: (i) amend, modify or terminate this Agreement, or agree or
consent to any amendment, modification or termination of this Agreement,
in any case on behalf of the Company, (ii) extend the time for performance
of, or waive, any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Acquisition
Sub under this Agreement, (iii) waive any of the Companys rights under
this Agreement, (iv) amend or otherwise modify in any material respect the
Company Certificate of Incorporation or Company By-Laws in any manner adverse
to the Companys stockholders or the Companys current or former officers
or directors, or in any manner which would prevent or delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or the stockholders receiving the
Merger Consideration, or (v) make any other determination or give any approval
or authorization that is required to be taken or given by the Company Board
with respect to any action to be taken or not to be taken by or on behalf of
the Company relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger. Following the election or
appointment of Parents designees pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ and prior to
the Effective Time, any actions with respect to the enforcement of this
Agreement by the Company shall be effected only by and at the direction of a
majority of the Continuing Directors (or the action of the sole Continuing
Director if there shall only be one (1) Continuing Director then in office),
and any such authorization or direction shall constitute the authorization
and direction of the full Company Board with respect thereto, and no other
action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director
of the Company, shall be required to authorize, or for the Company to take,
any such action.

 



18 ARTICLE III.

_THE MERGER_

3.1. _The Merger_ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Acquisition Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of Acquisition Sub shall cease, and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation").

3.2. _The Closing_ The closing of the Merger (the "Merger Closing") will take
place on the date of, or as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event
later than the second Business Day) following, the Offer Closing (or the Top-
Up Closing if the Top-Up has been exercised), provided that the conditions set
forth in _ARTICLE IX_ have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law)
waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
at the Merger Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions) at such time, at the offices of
Kirkland and Ellis LLP, located at 601 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York
10022, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent
and the Company. The date on which the Merger Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the "Merger Closing Date".

3.3. _The Effective Time_ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
promptly as reasonably practicable on the Merger Closing Date, the Parties
shall file a certificate of ownership and merger or a certificate of merger
(in either case, the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by,
and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
the DGCL, and shall make all other filings and recordings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on such date and time as the
Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such other date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree
and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the
Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective
Time".

3.4. _Effect of the Merger_ The Merger shall have the effects set forth
herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall possess all properties, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub, and all of the claims,
obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Acquisition Sub
shall become the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

3.5. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_

(a) At the Effective Time, the Company Certificate of Incorporation as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended so as to read
in its entirety as set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto and, as so amended,
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law,
subject to _Section 7.1_.

 

(b) The Parties shall take all necessary action such that, at the Effective
Time, the Company By-Laws as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended so as to read in their entirety as set forth in Exhibit
B attached hereto and, as so amended, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or
by applicable Law subject to _Section 7.1_.

 



19 3.6. _Directors and Officers_

 

(a) _Directors_. The Parties shall take all necessary action such that the
directors of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be.

 

(b) _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.

3.7. _Effect on Capital Stock_

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, or the holders
of any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

(i) _Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub_. Each share of capital stock of
Acquisition Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each
certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of
Acquisition Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

(ii) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A) shares
of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, or
by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition Sub
or the Company, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B)
except as provided in  _Section 3.7(c)_, the Appraisal Shares) shall be
automatically converted, subject to _Section 3.7(b)_, into the right to
receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares
in book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any dividends declared from and after the date hereof with
a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective
Time and that are due to such holder.

(iii) _Owned Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock owned
by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company or by any direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, in each case
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

(b) _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. Without limiting the other
provisions of this Agreement but without duplication of the provisions of
_Section 2.1(c)_, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, there shall be any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on
or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration as provided in  _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_ shall be equitably

 



20  adjusted to reflect the effect thereof, and such adjustment to the Merger
Consideration shall provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action;
_provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 3.7(b)_ shall be construed to
permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

(c) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
"Appraisal Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_, but instead such
holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective
Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw
or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to
be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of
the DGCL shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_, without
any interest thereon. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock or written
threats thereof, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of
the foregoing.

(d) _Company Restricted Stock_. Each holder of an unvested award of Company
Restricted Stock shall have the right to tender such Company Restricted Stock
into the Offer. Effective upon the acceptance for payment by Acquisition Sub
of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "Acceptance
Time"), each share of Company Restricted Stock (whether tendered into the
Offer or not) shall become fully vested, and, to the extent not withheld by
the Company to satisfy Tax withholding obligations, shall be treated the same
as other outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The Company shall take
all actions necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section
3.7(d)_ under the Company Stock Plan and any other plan or arrangement of the
Company, including delivering all notices and making any determinations and/or
resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof.

(e) _Company Options_. Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall assume any
Company Stock Options in connection with the Offer, Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. At the Acceptance Time, each
outstanding, unexpired and unexercised Company Stock Option shall vest and
become exercisable. To the extent not exercised prior to the Acceptance Time,
then upon the Effective Time each Company Stock Option shall be deemed to be
exercised and canceled, with each former holder of any such cancelled Company
Stock Option becoming entitled to receive, at the Effective Time or as soon as
practicable thereafter, in consideration of the deemed exercise and
cancellation of such Company Stock Option, an amount in cash, without
interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax, equal to
(i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option

 



21  multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option; _provided_ that if the exercise price
per share of any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the per
share Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be canceled and
terminated without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. The Company
shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by
this _Section 3.7(e)_ under all Company Stock Option agreements and any other
plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all required notices
and making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a
committee thereof.

3.8. _Exchange of Certificates_

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Merger Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying
agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Article III_ and, in connection therewith, shall enter
into an agreement with the Paying Agent in the form reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the "Paying Agency Agreement"). At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient
to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration as required to be paid pursuant to
this Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund"). If any holder of Appraisal Shares shall fail to perfect or otherwise
shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the
DGCL, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is
not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then Parent
shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration as required to be paid pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such Appraisal Shares, and the Exchange Fund shall
be deemed to include the cash so deposited.

 

(b) _Certificate Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary form (including
customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with
respect to shares held in book-entry form)), and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to
the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment of the Merger Consideration and any dividends declared with a
record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective
Time with respect to such Company Common Stock may be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration and any such dividends to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.8(b)_, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which
the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate
pursuant to this _Article III_ and any dividends declared with a record date
prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time and that
are due to such holder. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
III_.

 



22 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article
III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates,  _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving Corporations
obligation to pay all dividends declared with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the close of
business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall
be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as provided in
this  _Article III_.

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for nine (9) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall
remain liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_ and any dividends declared
with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the
Effective Time and that are due to any such holder.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in
compliance with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such
Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
immediately prior to such time become the property of Parent, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available). Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent, and any Taxes
resulting therefrom shall be paid by Parent. Nothing contained herein and no
investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall
diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided herein. To the extent that there are any losses
with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to
promptly pay the Merger Consideration to all holders of Certificates, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to
make such payments.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the

 



23  applicable Merger Consideration and any dividends declared with a record
date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time with
respect thereto.

 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Offer Price, Merger
Consideration, Equity Award Amount and any amounts otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any
holder of a Company Stock Option or Company Restricted Stock (together, the
"Company Equity Awards"), as applicable, such amounts as Parent, Acquisition
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of applicable tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, Acquisition Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock or the holder of the Company Equity
Award, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying

(to the extent either such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the
nature of its activities make such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not had, individually or in

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB_

 

Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company jointly
and severally as follows:

 



43 5.1. _Organization; Good Standing_ Parent is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under Delaware Law and has the
requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it is
presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its respective
properties and assets. Acquisition Sub is a corporation duly organized and
validly existing under Delaware Law and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted and to
own, lease or operate its respective properties and assets. Each of Parent
and Acquisition Sub is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
(to the extent either such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the
nature of its activities make such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Parent has delivered or made available to the Company complete and
correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other
constituent documents, as amended to date, of Parent and Acquisition Sub.

 

5.2. _Corporate Power; Enforceability_ Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub has
the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform their respective covenants and obligations hereunder
and, subject to either the adoption of this Agreement by Parent in accordance
with _Section 7.6_ or the adoption of resolutions by the board of directors
of Acquisition Sub in accordance with _Section 8.4(f)_, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery by Parent and
Acquisition Sub of this Agreement, the performance by Parent and Acquisition
Sub of their respective covenants and obligations hereunder and the
consummation by Parent and Acquisition Sub of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action on
the part of Parent and Acquisition Sub, and no other corporate or other
proceeding on the part of Parent or Acquisition Sub is necessary to authorize
the execution and delivery by Parent and Acquisition Sub of this Agreement,
the performance by Parent and Acquisition Sub of their respective covenants
and obligations hereunder or the consummation by Parent and Acquisition Sub of
the transactions contemplated hereby other than either the adoption of this
Agreement by Parent in accordance with _Section 7.6_ or the adoption of
resolutions by the board of directors of Acquisition Sub in accordance with
_Section 8.4(f)_. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each
of Parent and Acquisition Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of each of Parent and Acquisition Sub, enforceable against each in accordance
with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exception.

 

5.3. _Non-Contravention_ Except as set forth on _Section 5.3_ of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, the execution and delivery by Parent and Acquisition Sub
of this Agreement, the performance by Parent and Acquisition Sub of their
respective covenants and obligations hereunder and the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and
will not (a) violate or conflict with any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Acquisition Sub, (b) violate, conflict
with, or result in the breach of or constitute a default (or an event which
with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or result
in the termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in
a right of termination or acceleration under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract,
agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or Acquisition Sub
is a party or by which Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their properties or
assets may be bound, (c) assuming the Consents referred to in _Section 4.5_
are obtained or made, subject to the governmental filings and other matters
referred to in _Section 5.4_, violate or conflict with any Law or Order
applicable to Parent or Acquisition Sub or by which any of their properties
or assets are bound or (d) result in the creation of any Lien (other than
Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or Acquisition
Sub, except in the case of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d) above, for such
violations, conflicts, defaults, terminations, accelerations or Liens which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

 



44 5.4. _Required Governmental Approvals_ No Consent of any Governmental
Authority is required on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their
Affiliates in connection with the execution and delivery by Parent and
Acquisition Sub of this Agreement, the performance by Parent and Acquisition
Sub of their respective covenants and obligations hereunder and the

applicable Law, the Proxy Statement, (c) Consents required under, and
compliance with any other applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any

or, to the knowledge of Parent or any of its Affiliates, threatened in
writing against or affecting Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of their
Affiliates or any of their respective properties that would, individually or

Effect. Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub is subject to any outstanding Order
that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Company) except pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ that neither Parent nor
Acquisition Sub makes any representation with respect to any such ownership by
or through (i) a diversified mutual or pension fund managed by an independent
investment adviser or pension plan established for the benefit of Parents or
Parents controlled Affiliates employees, (ii) any employee benefit plan of
Parent or Parents controlled Affiliates for which investment decisions are

Parent or Acquisition Sub.

5.9. _Operations and Ownership of Acquisition Sub_ Acquisition Sub has been
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated

business activities and will have incurred no Liabilities or obligations other
than as contemplated by this Agreement. Parent owns, beneficially and of
record, all the outstanding shares of capital stock of Acquisition Sub, free
and clear of all Liens (other than any Liens created pursuant to the financing

any Person (including any shareholder, director, officer or other employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) concerning any investments to be made
in or contributions to be made to Parent or Acquisition Sub in connection
with the Merger and/or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
other than as set forth in an executed debt commitment letter (the "Debt
Commitment Letter"), engagement letter and fee letter, each dated as of the
date hereof, from Jefferies Group, Inc., of which a true and complete copy of
the Debt Commitment Letter has been provided to the Company. The Debt
Commitment Letter provides, subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt

Financing will not be available to Parent or Acquisition Sub on the date of
the Offer Closing. The Debt Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of the lender thereunder to make the full amount
of the Debt Financing available to Parent on the terms in the Debt Commitment

or any of their Affiliates is a party, that could (i) increase the
conditionality or (ii) reduce the amount of the Debt Financing, in the case
of this clause (ii), in any manner that would prevent or delay the ability of
the Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. Parent and Acquisition Sub have obtained the consent of the lenders
under the Debt Commitment Letter to publicly file the Debt Commitment Letter

or enter into any binding agreement, letter or similar agreement or
arrangement to take any of the foregoing actions.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement is intended to
give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries at any time prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over their own business and
operations.

negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, and promptly thereafter, deliver a written notice to
each such Person, and to any other Person that entered into a confidentiality
agreement in anticipation of potentially making an Acquisition Proposal
(which confidentiality agreement is still in effect as of the date of this
Agreement), to the effect that the Company is ending all discussions and
negotiations with such Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
effective on the date hereof, and the notice shall also request such Person
to promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of the applicable
confidentiality agreement with such Person.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 6.2(c)_, at all times during the period commencing
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
10.1_ and the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, nor
shall they authorize or direct any of their respective directors, officers or
other employees, controlled affiliates, or any investment banker, attorney or
other authorized agent or representative retained by any of them
(collectively, "Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate, propose or knowingly induce or knowingly encourage or assist the
making, submission or announcement of any proposal or offer that constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
furnish to any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any designees of

or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to any Person (other than Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any designees of Parent or Acquisition Sub) access to the
business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information,
or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in any such
case with the intent to induce, encourage or assist the making, submission or
announcement of, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person in
connection with or for the purpose of knowingly facilitating any Acquisition
Proposal or any proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) grant any waiver, amendment or release under
any standstill agreement or Takeover Law for the purpose of allowing a third
party to make an Acquisition Proposal (including providing consent or
authorization to any Person to make an Acquisition Proposal to any officer or
employee of the Company or to the Company Board or any member thereof), (v)
approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or (v)
enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or other similar Contract contemplating or otherwise
relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)_).

 



53 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 6.2(b)_,
prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and the
Companys Representatives may (i) participate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with any Person or group of Persons that has made a _bona fide_
, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal does
not arise out of any material breach of this _Section 6.2_), (ii) grant a
limited waiver, amendment or release under any standstill agreement for the
sole purpose of allowing any Person or group of Persons to make a written
Acquisition Proposal or a proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (including
providing consent or authorization to any Person to make an Acquisition
Proposal or such other proposal or offer to any officer of the Company or to
the Company Board or any member thereof) and/or (iii) furnish to any Person or
group of Persons that has made a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal or a proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition
Proposal or such other proposal or offer does not arise out of any
material breach of this _Section 6.2_) any non-public information relating
to the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries and/or afford to any such Person
or group of Persons access to the business, properties, assets, books, records
or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company and/or
any of its Subsidiaries, in each case under this clause (iii) pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that, prior to taking any
action described in the preceding clauses (i) or (iii), the Company Board (or
any authorized committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith, based
on information then available and after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal or such
other proposal or offer either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in the case of any action taken pursuant to the preceding
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), (A) the Company gives Parent written notice of the
identity of such Person or group of Persons and the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal or such other proposal or offer (unless such Acquisition
Proposal or such other proposal or offer is in written form, in which case the
Company shall give Parent a copy thereof), and (B) contemporaneously with
furnishing any non-public information to such Person or group of Persons, the
Company furnishes such non-public information to Parent (which may be by
posting such information to a "virtual data room" available to Parent and its
Representatives) to the extent such information has not been previously
furnished to Parent.

(d) If the Company becomes aware of any receipt by the Company of (i) any
Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) any request for information or any inquiry with
respect to, or which would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, the Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within one (1)
Business Day of the Companys Knowledge of any such event) notify Parent of
the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and
the identity of the Person or group of Persons making any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a prompt basis of any material change in the status or terms of
any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company shall provide to Parent, as soon as
practicable and in any event within one (1) Business Day after receipt or
delivery thereof, copies of all draft agreements (and any other written
material to the extent such material contains any financial terms, conditions
or other material terms relating to any Acquisition Proposal) provided to the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its Representatives by such Person
or group of Persons making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

 

6.3. _Company Board Recommendation_

(a) Except as expressly provided in this _Section 6.3_, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify
or modify in any manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify in any manner adverse
to Parent or Acquisition Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) adopt,
approve or recommend or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) (A) fail

 



54  to publicly recommend against any Acquisition Proposal within ten (10)
Business Days after Parent so requests in writing or (B) fail to publicly
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) Business Days after
Parent so reasonably requests in writing; _provided_ , that Parent may only
make two (2) such requests in any given fifteen (15) Business Day period; (iv)
fail to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9, against any Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the
Exchange Act within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such
Acquisition Proposal, (v) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy Statement, if applicable, or (vi) enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or similar document or
Contract relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than any Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with Section 6.2(c)) (any
action described in clauses (i) through (vi), a "Company Board Recommendation
Change"); _provided_ ,  _however_ that a "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Company Board (or any committee thereof) to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any
substantially similar communications, shall not be deemed to be a Company
Board Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Company Board (or any committee thereof) may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change if, at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder
Approval, (i) the Company Board (or any authorized committee thereof) shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Laws (ii) the Company has
notified Parent in writing (a "Recommendation Change Notice") at least
five (5) Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period"), that it intends to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, describing in reasonable detail
the reasons for such Company Board Recommendation Change and, in the case
of any Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making the Superior Proposal, and the material terms thereof (it being agreed
that the Recommendation Change Notice and any amendment or update to such
notice and the determination to so deliver such notice, or update or amend
public disclosures with respect thereto shall not constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement); (iii) if requested by
Parent, the Company shall and shall direct its Representatives to, during the
Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and Parents Representatives in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement; and (iv) the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel), after considering the terms of any proposed
amendment or modification to this Agreement, that the failure to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change would still be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under
applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal,
including taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the
provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_
, that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms
the Recommendation within five (5) Business Days following any reasonable
request by Parent; _provided_ , that Parent may only make two (2) such
requests in any given fifteen (15) Business Day period and (ii) making any
"stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act.

 



55 6.4. _Access_ At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall (i) afford Parent and its financial advisors, business
consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and Representatives
reasonable access and designated office space (when on the premises), during
normal business hours, to the properties, books and records and personnel of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, reasonable
access to the Companys corporate offices and each of its restaurants and
reasonable controlled access to the Companys information systems and computer
networks (which access to information systems and computer networks shall
include access to personnel information of the Companys officers or
employees, shall not include remote access ( _provided_ that Parent may have
supervised remote access to test the Companys information systems, but may
not have remote access to documents or information without the express
approval of the Company) and shall be conducted under the supervision of one
or more employees of the Company, who will be made available at all times
during normal business hours to facilitate immediate access to the Companys
books and records and who shall control the actual use of such systems and
networks), (ii) in a manner which does not interfere in any material respects
with the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, make available to
Parent and its Representatives, upon reasonable notice and during normal
business hours, all corporate office personnel and other employees at the
general manager level and above, whether on-site or, by travel to Parents
corporate offices in Houston, Texas, at Parents sole expense and upon advance
notice of at least forty-eight (48) hours, (iii) to facilitate the operations
of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries from and after the
Effective Time, permit Parent to make general communications to the Companys
corporate office personnel and other employees at the general manager level
and above, and (iv) permit Parent, under the supervision of an employee of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, upon advance notice of at least forty-eight
(48) hours, to communicate with the landlords of certain Lease Real Properties
for purposes of obtaining a consent (to the extent required) or granting an
estoppel in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise discussing the terms of any Lease; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit the access to any designated
office space, documents or information (including to the Companys information
systems and computer networks) or limit the access or communication to its
employees or any landlord to the extent that (A) any applicable Law requires
the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or
information, (B) access to such documents or information would give rise to a
material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine
or other applicable privilege applicable to such documents or information; (C)
access to such documents or information would violate any obligation of
confidentiality by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company existing on the
date hereof, or (D) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default
under, or give a third party the right to terminate or accelerate the rights
under, such Contract; and _provided_ _further_ , that no information or
knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted pursuant to the
access contemplated by this _Section 6.4_ shall affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this
Agreement. In the event that the Company does not provide access or
information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to communicate the applicable information to
Parent in a way that would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or
obligation or to waive such a privilege. Any investigation conducted pursuant
to the access contemplated by this _Section 6.4_ shall be conducted in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction
to any property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent
and its Representatives shall not be permitted to remove originals of any
documents or originals of any other materials from the Companys or
Subsidiaries premises (including the corporate offices or restaurants)
without the express approval of the Company. Any access to the Companys
properties shall be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and
insurance requirements and shall not include the right to perform invasive
testing. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its financial advisors,
business consultants, legal counsel,

 



56  accountants and other agents and Representatives in connection with any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
6.4_.

 

6.5. _Certain Litigation_ Each Party hereto shall promptly advise the other
parties hereto of any litigation commenced after the date hereof against such
Party or any of its directors (in their capacity as such) by any Company
Stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to the
Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and shall keep the other parties hereto reasonably informed regarding
any such litigation. Each Party hereto shall give the other parties hereto the
opportunity to consult with such Party regarding the defense or settlement
of any such shareholder litigation and shall consider such other Parties
views with respect to such shareholder litigation.

 

6.6. _Section 16(b) Exemption_ The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.7. _Stock Exchange Delisting_ Prior to the Merger Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws
and rules and policies of Nasdaq to cause the delisting of the Company and of
the Company Common Stock from Nasdaq as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under
the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

6.8. _Ownership of McCormick and Schmick Annapolis Liquor, Inc_. At Parents
request, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effectuate the
transfer of any capital stock of McCormick and Schmick Annapolis Liquor, Inc.
that is held by any Person other than the Company or any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company to Persons designated by Parent, at no cost to
Parent or Acquisition Sub, including the execution of appropriate
documentation related thereto, which transfer shall be effective no later than
(but conditioned on) the Effective Time. In connection with any such request,
Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to provide, or cause to be
provided, any information or other assistance required by any Governmental
Authority or third-party or otherwise reasonably requested by the Company in
order to facilitate any such transfer.

ARTICLE VII. __

 

 _COVENANTS OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB_

7.1. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to all
current and former directors or officers of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors and any Person who
becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Persons") under (i) any
indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation provision set forth in
any certificate of incorporation or bylaws or comparable organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date
of this Agreement and (ii) all indemnification agreements between the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and any such Indemnified Persons. For a period of
six (6) years after the Effective Time, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries shall amend,

 



57  repeal or otherwise modify the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of any Indemnified Parties with respect to indemnification, exculpation and
limitation of liabilities of the Indemnified Parties and advancement of
expenses.

 

(b) In addition to the provisions of _Section 7.1(a)_, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against
any costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains directly or
indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in
such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, or (ii)
the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, in each case to the same extent as provided in any
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or comparable organizational documents
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any indemnification
agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any such
Indemnified Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to
Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this
_Section 7.1(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully
and finally resolved. In addition, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, advance, prior to the
final disposition of any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which
indemnification may be sought under this Agreement, promptly following request
by an Indemnified Person therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses) incurred by such
Indemnified Person in connection with any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time prior
to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person
delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for advancement under
this _Section 7.1(b)_, then the right to advancement asserted in such notice
shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as
such claim is fully and finally resolved; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
such Indemnified Person provides an undertaking to repay such advances to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, if it is ultimately
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not
subject to any appeal) that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to
indemnification under applicable Law. In the event of any such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) Parent shall have the right to
control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood
that, by electing to control the defense thereof, Parent will be deemed to
have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Persons entitlement to
indemnification hereunder with respect thereto), (ii) each Indemnified Person
shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not Parent
shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, (iii) Parent shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Person, promptly after
statements therefor are received, whether or not Parent shall elect to
control the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry,
(iv) Parent shall provide each Indemnified Person and his or her own counsel
with reasonable access to the books and records of the Company after the
Effective Time to the extent such books and records are relevant to the
defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry and (v) no
Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or
her prior express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this _Section 7.1(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) shall
settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, proceeding,

 



58  investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought by an
Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified
Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry. Each Indemnified Person is, and the Indemnified
Persons collectively are, intended third party beneficiaries of this 
_Section 7.1(b)_, and each such Person shall have a right to enforce the
rights hereunder as if such person was a party to this Agreement.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may, in consultation with Parent,
obtain "tail" prepaid insurance policies with a claims period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect
to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary insurance
(collectively, "DandO Insurance"), for the Indemnified Persons, with terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable, in the
aggregate, as the Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters
existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time (including with respect to
acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby). If such "tail" prepaid
insurance policies have been obtained, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time to, maintain such policies in
full force and effect, for their full term, and to continue to honor its
respective obligations thereunder. If the Company fails to obtain such "tail"
prepaid insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to
maintain in effect, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of at
least six years from and after the Effective Time for the Indemnified Persons,
the DandO Insurance (provided that Parent (or any successor) may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage and amounts which are, in the aggregate, as favorable to
the Indemnified Persons as provided in the existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement, from an insurance carrier with the same or better rating as
the Companys current insurance carrier); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required, and the Company
shall not be permitted, to expend for such policies pursuant to this _Section
7.1_ an annualized premium amount in excess of 150% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for such insurance and if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and the Company may, obtain a substantially similar policy
(from an insurance carrier with the same or better rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier) with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding such amount. Each Indemnified Person is, and the Indemnified
Persons collectively are, intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section
7.1(c)_, and each such Person shall have a right to enforce the rights
hereunder as if such person was a party to this Agreement. 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume
all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in
this _Section 7.1_.

 

(e) The obligations set forth in this _Section 7.1_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any
Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the "tail"
policy referred to in _Section 7.1(c)_ or the DandO Insurance (and their heirs
and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the "tail"
policy referred to in _Section 7.1(c)_ or the DandO Insurance (and their heirs
and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons who
are beneficiaries under the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.1(c)_ or
the DandO Insurance (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be
third party beneficiaries of this  _Section 7.1_, with full rights of

 



59  enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons
(and other persons who are beneficiaries under the "tail" policy referred to
in _Section 7.1(c)_ or the DandO Insurance (and their heirs and
representatives)) under this _Section 7.1_ shall be in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational
documents of, or any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or
in equity).

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.1_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

7.2. _Employee Matters_

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the
Effective Time, as applicable.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all Employee Plans and
compensation arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that nothing in this
sentence shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or
terminating, or from causing the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate,
any such Employee Plans, arrangements or agreements in accordance with their
terms or if otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

(c) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
provide compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity based
benefits and individual employment agreements) to each Continuing Employee
that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than
the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity based
benefits and individual employment agreements) currently provided to Parents
similarly situated employees ("Comparable Plans").

 

(d) To the extent that a Comparable Plan is made available to any Continuing
Employee on or following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause to be granted to
such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility
to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service
is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay
entitlement); _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be credited
to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to (1) cause each Continuing Employee to be
immediately eligible to participate in any and all Comparable Plans, and (2)
cause to be waived all eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of
insurability requirements and the application of any pre-existing conditions
limitations under such plans, but only to the extent coverage under any such
Comparable Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Employee Plan in which
such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time;
and (ii) for purposes of each Comparable Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits to any Continuing Employee,
the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each third party
insurer to (1) waive all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions,
evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or
similar requirements of such Comparable Plan for such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under

 



60  the comparable Employee Plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which
such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (2)
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Employee
Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding
Comparable Plan begins to be given full credit under such Comparable Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid
in accordance with such Comparable Plan. Any vacation or paid time off
accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be credited to such Continuing Employee following the
Effective Time, and shall not be subject to accrual limits or other
forfeiture and shall not limit future accruals.

(e) Nothing in this  _Section 7.2_, express or implied, shall affect the
right of the Company (or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable) to
terminate the employment of any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or shall be construed to grant any current or former employee of
the Company (or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable) or any of its
Subsidiaries a right to continued employment by, or to receive any payment or
benefits from, the Company (or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable) or
any of its Subsidiaries or through any Employee Plan or other benefit plan
that increases or expands such Persons rights beyond what is provided by the
terms of such plan. Other than as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement (including pursuant to the limitations and requirements
specifically set forth in this _Section 7.2_ and in _Section 7.2(e)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter), nothing in this Agreement shall limit the ability
of the Company (or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable) or its
Affiliates (including Parent and its Affiliates after the consummation of the
Offer and/or the Merger) to amend or terminate any Employee Plan or other
benefit or compensation plan or program. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, shall (i) constitute an amendment to any Employee Plan or other
benefit plan, (ii) create any third party beneficiary rights or (iii) inure to
the benefit of or be enforceable by any employee, director or consultant of
the Company (or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable), any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates, of any entity or any Person
representing the interest of any such employee, director or consultant or of
any Person whose rights are derivative of any such employee, director or
consultant (including a family member or estate of any such employee, director
of consultant).

(f) Prior to the Offer Closing Date, the Company Board shall adopt a
resolution stating that the McCormick and Schmick Acquisition Corp. 401(k) Plan
shall terminate effective on the day preceding the Offer Closing Date (or as
of such other time as the Parties mutually agree), but contingent upon the
occurrence of the Offer Closing.

7.3. _Obligations of Acquisition Sub_ Parent shall take all action necessary
to cause Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement.

 

7.4. _Financing_

(a) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under the
Debt Commitment Letter or fee letter (except in compliance with the
provisions of the fee letter in effect as of the date hereof), if such
amendment, modification or waiver reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount) in a manner that would prevent or delay the consummation of
the Debt Financing, amends the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to make the funding of the Debt
Financing less likely to 

 



61  occur or imposes additional material obligations on the Company, its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates of the Company prior to the Offer Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Acquisition Sub may amend or restate
the Debt Commitment Letter or fee letter to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities as parties thereto who had
not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. Parent shall
promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification or
waiver. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions (such terms and conditions to include provisions contained in
the fee letter) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or fee letter, (i)
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly notify the Company and (ii) Parent
and Acquisition Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount and on
terms sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (the
"Alternative Debt Financing"). Parent shall promptly provide a true, correct
and complete copy of each Alternative Debt Financing commitment to the
Company. For purposes of this _Section 7.4(a)_, references to "Debt
Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this _Section
7.4(a)_ and references to "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such
documents as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this _Section
7.4(a)_. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide to the Company copies of
the material definitive documents for the Debt Financing and shall give the
Company prompt notice (and in any event, within one (1) Business Day) (i) of
the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from a
financing source for the Debt Financing with respect to any actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing or
any material provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive document related to the Debt Financing; and (ii) of the occurrence
of an event or development that Parent or Acquisition Sub expects to have a
material and adverse impact on the ability of Parent or Acquisition Sub to
obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive documents related to the Debt
Financing. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall publicly file the Debt Commitment
Letter with the SEC and take such actions required by applicable Law. Once
funded with the total, aggregate proceeds necessary to consummate the Offer
and the Merger in accordance with the penultimate sentence of  _Section
2.1(d)_, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall cause the escrow account established
pursuant to the Acceptable Escrow Agreement to remain in place and fully
funded until at least the Extended Expiration Date (after taking into
account all extensions thereof required by _Section 2.1(d)_), to the extent
such aggregate proceeds are not released prior thereto in accordance with
_Section 2.1(d)_.

 

(b) Prior to the Merger Closing, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the respective officers, employees, consultants
and advisors, including legal and accounting advisors, of the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent and Acquisition Sub any
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent and Acquisition Sub in connection
with the arrangement of debt financing for any portion of the aggregate funds
to consummate the Offer and the Merger, including, without limitation, (i)
furnishing Parent, Acquisition Sub and their financing sources, as promptly as
practicable, with financial and other pertinent information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries as may reasonably be requested in writing by
Parent and identifying any portion of such information that constitutes
material non-public information, (ii) in each case upon reasonable notice and
in reasonably convenient locations, making senior management of the Company
available to participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations,
road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with
prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies in connection with the
financing, (iii) assisting with the preparation of customary materials for
rating agency presentations (and assisting in the obtaining of corporate,
credit and facility ratings from ratings agencies), offering documents,
private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and all
other material to be used in connection with the financing (including
customary authorization and management representation letters)

 



62  and all documentation and other information required in connection with
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001, (iv) using reasonable best
efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters as reasonably requested by
Parent, (v) entering into one or more credit or other agreements on terms
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Acquisition Sub in connection with such
debt financing immediately prior to the Offer Closing, (vi) taking all
corporate actions, subject to and only effective upon the occurrence of the
Acceptance Time, required to permit the consummation of the financing and to
permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to the Surviving Corporation
immediately after the Acceptance Time, and (vii) otherwise taking actions
within its control to cooperate in satisfying the conditions precedent set
forth in any definitive document related to the financing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under any such credit or other agreement shall be effective until the
Effective Time, (B) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the
extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, and (C) neither the Company nor any of the
Companys Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment fee or similar
fee or incur any liability with respect to such debt financing prior to the
Merger Closing. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly, upon
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries in connection with the foregoing cooperation, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents and other Representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of such
debt financing and any information utilized in connection therewith to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and with appropriate contribution
to the extent such indemnification is not available (other than arising from
(x) such Persons fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation or (y) material misstatements or omissions in written
historical information of the type prepared by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business that is provided by the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries specifically for use in
connection with the debt financing).

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, Parents and Acquisition Subs obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not subject to
any conditions regarding Parents, Acquisition Subs or any other Persons
ability to finance, or obtain financing for, the Offer or the Merger.

(d) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company agree that (i) any Legal
Proceeding involving Jefferies Group, Inc. or any Investor (as defined in the
Debt Commitment Letter) arising out of or relating to the Offer, the Merger,
the Debt Commitment Letter, the engagement letter, the fee letter, or the
performance of any services thereunder be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of a state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware,
(ii) it will not, and it will not permit any of its Affiliates to, bring or
support anyone else in bringing any such Legal Proceeding in any other court,
(iii) it waives any right to trial by jury in respect of any such
Legal Proceeding, and (iv) that Jefferies Group, Inc. or any Investor (and
their respective affiliates) are express third-party beneficiaries of this
_Section 7.4(d)_.

 



63 7.5. _Stockholder and Management Arrangements_ Except to the extent
expressly authorized by the Company Board (or any committee thereof) in
advance, none of Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates, shall enter into any Contract, or make or enter into any formal or
informal arrangement or other understanding (whether or not binding), with
any Person relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries, businesses or operations (including as to
continuing employment or compensation) from and after the Merger Closing.

7.6. _Other Actions by Parent and Acquisition Sub_ Parent shall, promptly
following the execution of this Agreement, approve and adopt this Agreement in
its capacity as sole stockholder of Acquisition Sub in accordance with
applicable Law and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
Acquisition Sub and deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or action by
written consent so approving and adopting this Agreement.

7.7. _Tax Matters_ All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use, registration,
value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable real estate
transfer Taxes and real property transfer gains Taxes and including any
filing and recording fees) and related amounts (including any penalties,
interest and additions to Tax) and all such reasonable costs (including
accounting and legal fees) associated with filing all Tax Returns related to
transfer Taxes incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby
("Transfer Taxes") shall be paid by Parent. Parent shall be responsible for
filing all Tax Returns related to Transfer Taxes. All Parties hereto shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to avail themselves of any available
exemptions from any such Transfer Taxes, and to cooperate with the other
Parties hereto in providing any information and documentation that may be
necessary to obtain such exemptions.

neither Parent or Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the
other hand, shall take any action, or fail to take any action, that is
intended to, or has (or would reasonably be expected to have) the effect of,
preventing, impairing, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the ability of such party to
fully perform its obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, for the avoidance of doubt, no action permitted to be taken pursuant
to  _Section 6.2_ or _Section 6.3_ shall be prohibited, or required to be
taken, by this sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (A)
the Company shall not be required prior to the Effective Time to pay
any consent or other similar fee, "profit sharing" or other similar payment
or other consideration (including increased rent or other similar payments or

(including a guaranty) to obtain the consent, waiver or approval of any Person
under any Contract and (B) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries

Contract or Lease in connection with obtaining any consent in connection with
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby

or Person may assert under any applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the
Offer or the Merger. The Company and Parent shall split on a 50/50 basis all
filing fees under the HSR Act and any fees or other payments to any

initiated by a private party. If any Party hereto or Affiliate thereof shall
receive a request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws with respect to
which any such filings have been made, then such Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other Party, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request. In connection with and without

other (or counsel of each Party, as appropriate) with copies of all written
communications to or from any Governmental Authority relating to the Offer or

to the other may be made on a counsel-only basis to the extent required under
applicable Law or as appropriate to protect Confidential Information.

(c) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one
another in good faith to (i) promptly determine whether any filings not
contemplated by _Section 8.3a)_ are required to be or should be made, and
whether any other consents, approvals, permits or authorizations not
contemplated by _Section 8.3(a)_ are required to be or should be obtained,
from any Governmental Authority under any other applicable Law in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) promptly make any
filings, furnish information required in connection therewith and seek to

mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and
at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, not to contain any untrue

required by Section 253 of the DGCL, to cause the Merger to become effective
as soon as practicable after the Offer Closing without the Stockholders
Meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

 



68 8.5. _Anti-Takeover Laws_ In the event that the restrictions of any state
anti-takeover or other similar Law are or become applicable to this Agreement

pursuant to the Offer or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such
injunction shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_
, that in the case of an injunction a Party shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(c)_ if the issuance
of any such injunction is attributable to the failure of such Party (or any
Affiliate of such Party) to perform any covenant or other obligation under
this Agreement required to be performed by such Party (or any Affiliate of
such Party) at or prior to the Effective Time; or

(d) by the Company, in the event that (i) the Company shall have received a
bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition
Proposal did not arise out of any material breach of Section 6.2); (ii) the
Company Board (or any authorized committee thereof) shall have determined in
good faith, based on information then available and after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such bona fide,
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal,
(iii) the members of the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
the failure to enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Superior
Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with their fiduciary
duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law; (iv) the Company
shall have delivered to Parent a Recommendation Change Notice; (v) if
requested by Parent, the Company

 



70  shall have made itself and its Representatives available to negotiate with
Parent and Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m.
Pacific Time on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such
Recommendation Change Notice and ending five (5) Business Days later at 5:00
p.m. Pacific Time (it being understood and hereby agreed that such five (5)
Business Day period may be the same as the Notice Period contemplated by
_Section 6.3(b)_); (v) the members of the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel), after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or
modification to this Agreement, that the failure to enter into a definitive
agreement relating to such Superior Proposal would still reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties to the Company
Stockholders under applicable Law and that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (vi) concurrently with the termination of
this Agreement, the Company pays Parent the Company Termination Fee payable
to Parent pursuant to _Section 10.3(c)_;

(e) by Parent, in the event that (i) Parent and Acquisition Sub are not in
breach of any of their respective representations, warranties or covenants
under this Agreement in any material respect, and (ii) the Company shall have
breached any of its representations, warranties or covenants under this
Agreement such that the conditions set forth in clauses (ii) or (iii) of
paragraph (c) of _Annex I_ would not be satisfied and shall have failed to
cure such breach within thirty (30) days after the Company has received
written notice of such breach from Parent (it being understood that Parent
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
10.1(e)_ in respect of the breach set forth in any such written notice (x) at
any time during such thirty (30) day period, and (y) at any time after such
thirty (30) day period if the Company shall have cured such breach during such
thirty (30) day period); or

(f) by Parent, in the event that (i) the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change, (ii) the
Company failed to include in the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 14D-9, in
each case when mailed, the Company Board Recommendation, or (iii) there is a
material breach of Section 6.2 or Section 6.3 by the Company;

(g) by the Company, in the event that (i) the Company is not in breach of any
of its representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement in any
material respect and (ii) Parent or Acquisition Sub shall have breached any of
its representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement (which
breach would or would reasonably be expected to individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect) and Parent or Acquisition
Sub, as the case may be, shall have failed to cure such breach within thirty
(30) days after Parent has received written notice of such breach from the
Company (it being understood that the Company shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(g)_ in respect of the
breach set forth in any such written notice (A) at any time during such
thirty (30) day period, and (B) at any time after such thirty (30) day period
if Parent and Acquisition Sub shall have cured such breach during such thirty
(30) day period);

 

(h) by the Company, in the event that (i) Acquisition Sub fails to commence
the Offer with the time required by  _Section 2.1(a)_ or terminates or makes
any material change to the Offer in violation of the terms of this Agreement
or (ii) at any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, Acquisition Sub fails
to accept for payment and pay for shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer subject to the terms of and in
accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_ and at such time all of the conditions set
forth in _Annex I_ are satisfied and no subsequent expiration date for the
Offer is established pursuant to an authorized extension of the Offer;
provided, that in the case of clause (i) hereof, the Company shall have given
Parent written notice at least four (4) Business Days prior to such
termination stating the Companys intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 10.1(h)_ and the basis for such termination; or

 



71 (i) by the Company or Parent, in the event that as of any scheduled expiration
date of the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or
waived (to the extent waivable in accordance with its terms) by Parent except
for the Minimum Tender Condition and no further extensions or re-extensions of
the Offer by Parent and Acquisition Sub are required pursuant to _Section
2.1(d)_; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 10.1(i)_ shall not be available to any Party whose breach of any
covenant or obligation under this Agreement has been a principal cause of, or
primarily resulted in, the failure of the Minimum Tender Condition to be
satisfied as of any scheduled expiration date of the Offer.

 

10.2. _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_ Any proper and valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 10.1_ shall be effective
immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the terminating Party to
the other Party or Parties hereto, as applicable. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 10.1_, this Agreement
shall be of no further force or effect without liability of any Party or
Parties hereto, as applicable (or any director, officer, employee, affiliate,
agent or other representative of such Party or Parties) to the other Party or
Parties hereto, as applicable, except (a) for the terms of _ARTICLE I_ , the
second to the last sentence of _Section 2.2(c)_, the last sentence of
_Section 6.4_, the second to last sentence of  _Section 7.4(b)_, _Section
8.7_, this _Section 10.2_, _Section 10.3_ and _ARTICLE XI_ , each of which
shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (b) subject to _Section
10.3(g)_, nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any Party or Parties
hereto, as applicable, from liability for any knowing and intentional breach
of, or fraud in connection with, this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing,
no termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties
hereto set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations
shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

 

10.3. _Fees and Expenses._

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this _Section 10.3_, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party or Parties, as applicable,
incurring such expenses whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated.

(b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Section 10.1(b)_, _Section 10.1(e)_, or _Section 10.1(i)_, (ii) at or
prior to the time of the termination of this Agreement, there shall have been
publicly disclosed a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal and such Acquisition
Proposal shall not have been withdrawn prior to the time of the event giving
rise to the termination of this Agreement, and (iii) within twelve (12)
months following the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any
Acquisition Proposal is consummated, then, in any such case, the Company shall
pay to Parent $3,900,000 (the "Termination Fee"), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent, within two (2) Business Days after such transaction is consummated.
Solely for the purposes of this Section 10.3(b), all references to "15%" in
the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to
"a majority".

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.1(d)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, as a condition to the effectiveness of such
termination.

 

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 10.1(f)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after demand by
Parent.

 



72 (e) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Section 10.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if
the Company fails promptly to pay the Termination Fee due pursuant to
_Section 10.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
Legal Proceeding that results in an award against the Company for such fee,
the Company shall pay Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such Legal Proceeding,
together with interest on the amount of the applicable fee from the date such
payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime
lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made.

(f) In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (x) if the Company pays the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
10.3_, then any such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent
and Acquisition Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners, equity
holders, managers, members, Affiliates or successors and none of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates
or successors shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (z)
if Parent or Acquisition Sub receives any payments from the Company in respect
of any breach of this Agreement, and thereafter Parent is entitled to receive
the Termination Fee under _Section 10.3_, the amount of such Termination Fee
shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of any payments made by the Company
to Parent or Acquisition Sub in respect of any such breaches of this
Agreement.

 



73 10.4. _Amendment_ This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time
before or after the Offer Closing shall have occurred or the Stockholder
Approval shall have been obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) after the
Offer Closing and subject to _Section 3.7(b)_, there shall be no amendment
that decreases the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration, and (y) after the
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that
by applicable Law requires further approval by the Company Stockholders
without such further approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties.

10.5. _Extension; Waiver_ At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any Party or Parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed
and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party or
Parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such Party or Parties hereto contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party or
Parties hereto contained herein (other than, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Minimum Tender Condition unless such waiver is consented to in writing by
the Company). Any agreement on the part of a Party or Parties hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party or Parties, as applicable. Any delay
in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of
such right.

75 11.3. _Assignment_ No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other Parties, and any assignment without such prior written
approval shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall (i) be binding upon the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns and (ii) shall inure to the benefit of the
Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

11.4. _Entire Agreement_ This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the Parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to
herein or therein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Annexes
hereto, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be
superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and
shall continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the
Effective Time and (b) the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires
in accordance with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.
EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB OR ANY OF THEIR
AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE ONE
HAND, NOR THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE), OR AS TO THE
ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE (OR MADE AVAILABLE) BY
ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH,
THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER
OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH
RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

11.5. _Third Party Beneficiaries_ This Agreement is not intended to, and shall
not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except
the Indemnified Persons as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and
provisions of _Section 7.1_, and Jefferies Group, Inc. or any Investor as set
forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of _Section 7.4(d)._

11.6. _Severability_ In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

 



76 11.7. _Specific Performance; Remedies_ The Parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached and that in any such case any breach of this Agreement
could not be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone. Accordingly,
the Parties agree that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 10.1_, each Party shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific performance or
equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent
jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with _Section 11.9_, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under the terms of
this Agreement at law or in equity. Each Party hereto accordingly agrees not
to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party
under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this _Section 11.7_.
Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to post a bond or undertaking in connection
with such order or injunction sought in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 11.7_. If any legal action or other legal proceeding relating to
this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is
brought against any Party to this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be
entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees, costs and disbursements (in
addition to any other relief to which the prevailing Party may be entitled).

11.8. _Governing Law_ THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER AT LAW,
IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT) THAT MAY BE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED UPON,
RELATING TO ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF, SHALL
BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE
PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF.

11.9. _Consent to Jurisdiction_

 

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New
Castle County in the State of Delaware or Delaware Superior Court, for the
purpose of any Legal Proceeding directly or indirectly based upon, relating
to arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or
the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof, and each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to such action or
proceeding shall be brought in, and may be heard and determined, exclusively
in such state or federal courts. Each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue in, and any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any action or proceeding
so brought. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. 

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and
complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of itself or its
property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such Party at the
addresses set forth in _Section 11.2_. Nothing in this _Section 11.9_ shall
affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

 



77 11.10. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_ EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED UPON, RELATING
TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER,
(II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATION OF THIS
WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

 

11.11. _Company Disclosure Letter References_ The parties hereto agree that
the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in
the corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement, and (ii) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in this Agreement as though fully set forth in such other
representation and warranty (or covenant, as applicable), but in the case of
this clause (ii) only if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to
(or a disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties
(or covenants, as applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other manner in the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an admission or indication
that such item or other matter is material or that such item or other matter
is required to be referred to or disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter.
The information set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter is disclosed solely
for the purposes of this Agreement, and no information set forth therein
shall be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any third party of
any matter whatsoever, including of any violation of Law or breach of any
agreement.

11.12. _Counterparts_ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other Party, it being understood that all
Parties need not sign the same counterpart.

shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer if: (a) there
shall not be validly tendered prior to the expiration of the Offer a number of
shares of Company Common Stock that when added to the number of shares owned
by Parent, Acquisition Sub and any of their respective Affiliates (if any),
represent a majority of the sum of (x) the issued and outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock as of the expiration of the Offer plus (y) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable to holders of Company Stock
Options from which the Company or its Representatives have received notices of
exercise prior to the expiration of the Offer (and as to which shares of
Company Common Stock have not yet been issued to such exercising holders of
Company Stock Options) (the "Minimum Tender Condition"); (b) the waiting
period applicable to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant

expiration of the Offer:

 

(i) there shall be any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent in
nature) issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other restraint or
prohibition of any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in effect,
or any Law enacted, entered, promulgated, enforced or deemed applicable by any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and remaining in effect,
that, in any such case, has the effect of making the Offer or the Merger (or
the Top-Up, if the Top-Up is necessary to ensure that Parent or Acquisition
Sub owns at least 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock immediately after the Acceptance Time) illegal or otherwise prohibiting
or preventing the consummation of the Offer or the Merger (or the Top-Up, if
the Top-Up is necessary to ensure that Parent or Acquisition Sub owns at least
90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock immediately after the
Acceptance Time);

(ii) (A) any of the representations and warranties of the Company (other than
the representation and warrantees set forth in _Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 (other
than 4.3(a)(vii)), 4.4, 4.5(a)(i) and (c), 4.6, 4.7, 4.12, 4.27, 4.28, and
4.29_ ) set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct
(disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to "materiality," "Company
Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set forth therein),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true
and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and except, in each case,
to the extent such representations and warranties are made as of a specific
date (in which case such representations and warranties shall not be true and
correct as of such specific date only), (B) the representations and warranties
set forth in _Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 (other than 4.3(a)(vii)), 4.4, 4.5(a)(i)
and (c), 4.6, 4.12, 4.27, 4.28, and 4.29_ shall not be true and correct in all
material respects or (C) the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 4.7_ shall not be true and correct in all respects except where the
failure of such representations or warranties to be so true and correct has
resulted or would reasonably be expected to result in additional cost, expense
or liability to the Company, Parent and their Affiliates in excess
of $250,000;

(iii) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material
respects with its obligations required to be performed or complied with by it
under this Agreement;

 



2 (iv) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any
change, circumstance, event or occurrence that has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

(v) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

At the request of Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate
executed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer or the chief
financial officer of the Company certifying that none of the conditions set
forth in clauses (c)(ii), (c)(iii), and (c)(iv) above shall have occurred and
be continuing as of the expiration of the Offer.

ARTICLE I

 

STOCKHOLDERS

 

SECTION 1.1. _Annual Meetings_. An annual meeting of stockholders to elect
directors and transact such other business as may properly be presented to
the meeting may be held at such place, within or without the State of
Delaware, as may be designated by or in the manner provided in the Certificate
of Incorporation or the Bylaws, or if not so designated, as the Board
of Directors may from time to time determine. If pursuant to the Certificate
of Incorporation or the Bylaws, the Board of Directors is authorized to
determine the place of a meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors may,
in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting shall not be held at any
place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as
authorized by the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL").

 

If authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to
such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt,
stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of
stockholders may, by means of remote communication, participate in a meeting
of stockholders and be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of
stockholders, whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or
solely by means of remote communication. If such means are authorized, the
Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person
deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote
communication is, in fact, a stockholder or proxyholder. The Corporation shall
also implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and
proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to
vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to
read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with
such proceedings. If a stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action
at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or
other action shall be maintained by the Corporation.

SECTION 1.2.  _Special Meetings_. A special meeting of stockholders may be
called at any time by two or more directors or the Chairman of the Board or
the President and shall be called by any of them or by the Secretary upon
receipt of a written request to do so specifying the matter or matters,
appropriate for action at such a meeting, proposed to be presented at the
meeting and signed by holders of record of a majority of the shares of stock
that would be entitled to be voted on such matter or matters if the meeting
were held on the day such request is received and the record date for such
meeting were the close of business on the preceding day. Any such meeting
shall be held at such time and at such place, within or without the State
of Delaware, as shall be determined by the body or person calling such
meeting and as shall be stated in the notice of such meeting.

SECTION 1.3. _Notice of Meeting; Notice to Stockholders_. For each meeting of
stockholders, written notice shall be given stating the place, if any, date
and hour, the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders
and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person  and may vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the
purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Except as otherwise
provided by Delaware law, the written notice of any meeting shall be given
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each
stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, notice shall be
deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
directed to the stockholder at such stockholders address as it appears on the
records of the Corporation.

Any notice given to a stockholder under any provision of the DGCL, the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form
of electronic transmission consented to by such stockholder. Any such consent
shall be revocable by a stockholder by written notice to the Corporation and
shall be deemed revoked under the circumstances described in the DGCL. Notice
given to stockholders by electronic transmission shall be given as provided in
the DGCL.

 

SECTION 1.4. _Quorum_. Except as otherwise required by the DGCL or the
Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of record of a majority of the
shares of stock entitled to be voted present in person or represented by proxy
at a meeting shall constitute a quorum, for the transaction of business at the
meeting, but in the absence of a quorum the holders of record present
or represented by proxy at such meeting may vote to adjourn the meeting from
time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, unless
otherwise provided in the DGCL or Bylaws, until a quorum is obtained.

 

SECTION 1.5. _Chairman and Secretary at Meeting_. At each meeting of
stockholders, the Chairman of the Board, or in such persons absence, the
person designated in writing by the Chairman of the Board, or if no person is
so designated, then a person designated by the Board of Directors, shall
preside as chairman of the meeting; if no person is so designated, then the
meeting shall choose a chairman by plurality vote. The Secretary, or in such
persons absence, a person designated by the chairman of the meeting, shall
act as secretary of the meeting.

 

SECTION 1.6. _Voting; Proxies_. Except as otherwise provided by the DGCL or
the Certificate of Incorporation:

 

(a) Each stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to
one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.

(b) Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to
express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting
may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy,
but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its
date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A stockholder may
authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy by
transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or
other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder
of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service
organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the
holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any
such telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission must
either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be
determined that the telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic
transmission was authorized by the stockholder.

(c) Directors shall be elected by a plurality vote.

 

(d) Each matter, other than election of directors, properly presented to any
meeting, shall be decided by a majority of the votes cast on the matter.

 



2 (e) Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation,
all elections of directors shall be by written ballot. Voting on all other
matters need not be by written ballot unless ordered by the chairman of the
meeting or if so requested by any stockholder present or represented by proxy
at the meeting and entitled to vote on such matter.

(f) If authorized by the Board of Directors, the requirement of a
written ballot may be satisfied by a ballot submitted by electronic
submission, accompanied by the information specified in the DGCL.

 

SECTION 1.7. _Adjourned Meetings_. A meeting of stockholders may be adjourned
to another time or place. Unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record
date, stockholders of record for an adjourned meeting shall be as originally
determined for the meeting from which the adjournment was taken. Except as
provided in the next succeeding sentence, notice need not be given of the
adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote
communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed
to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at
the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. If the adjournment is for more
than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote. At the adjourned meeting at which
there shall be present or represented the holders of record of the requisite
number of shares, any business may be transacted that might have been
transacted at the meeting as originally called. 

SECTION 1.8. _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_. Any action that may
be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken
without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in
writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. A telegram, cablegram or
other electronic transmission consenting to action shall be deemed to be
written, signed and dated provided that it sets forth or is delivered with
information from which the Corporation can determine that it was transmitted
by the stockholder, proxyholder or by a person authorized to act for the
stockholder or proxyholder and the date on which it was transmitted. No
consent given by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission shall be
deemed to have been delivered until there shall have been compliance with
applicable provisions of the DGCL. Notice of the taking of such action shall
be given promptly to each stockholder that did not consent thereto in writing
to the extent such notice is required by the provisions of the DGCL.

SECTION 1.9. _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. At least 10 days before
every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to
vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address
of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder, shall be prepared. Such list shall be open to the examination of
any stockholder (as defined in Section 220 of the DGCL or any successor
statute) for any proper purpose, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the
meeting, (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the
information required to gain access to the list is provided with the notice
of the meeting, or (b) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place
of business of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, such
list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during
the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, such
list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole
time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the
information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of
the meeting.

SECTION 1.10. _Fixing of Record Date_. In order that the Corporation may
determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of
stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or 

 



3  to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment
of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be
more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting, nor more
than 60 days prior to any other action. If no record date is fixed, the record
date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day
next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at
the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting
is held; the record date for determining stockholders entitled to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior
action by the Board of Directors is necessary, shall be the day on which the
first written consent is expressed; and the record date for any other purpose
shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors
adopts the resolution relating thereto.

meeting.

 

SECTION 2.9. _Action Without Meeting_. Unless otherwise restricted by the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, any action required or permitted to

may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or of
such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or
by electronic transmission and the writing or writings are filed with the
minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or of such committee. Such
electronic transmission or transmissions filing shall be in paper form if the
minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if such
minutes are maintained in electronic form.

SECTION 2.10. _Committees of the Board_. The Board of Directors may, by
resolution passed by the Board of Directors, designate one or more other
committees, each such committee to have such name and to consist of one or
more directors as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine. Any
such committee, to the extent provided in such resolution or resolutions,
shall have and may exercise the powers and authority of the Board of Directors
in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, but no such
committee shall have such power or authority in reference to (a) approving or
adopting, or recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter expressly
required by the DGCL to be submitted to stockholders for approval, or (b)
adopting, amending or repealing any Bylaw. In the absence or disqualification
of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any
meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute
a quorum, 

 



5  may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at
the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.

 

SECTION 2.11. _Compensation_. No director shall receive any stated salary for
such persons services as a director or as a member of a committee but shall

the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL or any other applicable law;
provided, however, that the Corporation may modify the extent of such
indemnification by individual contracts with its directors, executive officers
and other designated officers; and, provided, further, that the Corporation
shall not be required to indemnify any director, executive officer and other
designated officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person unless (i) such indemnification is expressly required
to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, (iii) the indemnification is provided by the
Corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the
Corporation 

 



7  under the DGCL or any other applicable law or (iv) such indemnification is
required to be made under Section 5.2. The Corporation shall have the power to
indemnify its other officers, employees and other agents as set forth in the
DGCL or any other applicable law. The Board of Directors shall have the power
to delegate the determination of whether indemnification shall be given to any
such person to such officers or other persons as the Board of Directors shall
determine.

SECTION 5.2. _Expenses_.

 

(a) The Corporation shall advance to any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or executive officer of the
Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as
a director or executive officer of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final disposition of the
proceeding, promptly following a request therefor, all expenses incurred by
any director, executive officer and other designated officer in connection
with such proceeding; provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, an
advancement of expenses incurred by a director, executive officer and other
designated officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not
in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee,
including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be
made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf
of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to
appeal (a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified for such expenses under this Article V or otherwise.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to
5.4 of this Article V, no advance shall be made by the Corporation to an
officer of the Corporation (except by reason of the fact that such officer is
or was a director of the Corporation in which event this paragraph shall not
apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and promptly
made (i) by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to the
proceeding, even if not a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors
designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a
quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or such directors so direct,
by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to
the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate
clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner
that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation.

SECTION 5.3. _Enforcement._ Without the necessity of entering into an express
contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors, executive
officers and other designated officers under this Article V shall be deemed to
be contractual rights and be effective to the same extent and as if provided
for in a contract between the Corporation and the director, executive officer
or other designated officer. Any right to indemnification or advances granted
by this Article V to a director, executive officer or other designated officer
shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any
court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or
advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim
is made within 90 days of request therefor. The claimant in such enforcement
action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also
the expense of prosecuting the claim. In connection with any claim for
indemnification, the Corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to
any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that
make it permissible under the DGCL or any other applicable law for the
Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. In connection
with any claim by an officer of the Corporation (except in any action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by
reason of the fact that such officer is or was a director of the Corporation)
for advances, the Corporation shall be entitled to raise a defense as to any
such action clear and convincing evidence that such person acted in bad faith
or

 



8  in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation, or with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding that such person acted without reasonable cause to believe that
his conduct was lawful. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its
Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have
made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because the
officer or director has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
the DGCL or any other applicable law nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or
its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of
conduct shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant
has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

SECTION 5.4. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person
by this Article V shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person
may have or hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such persons
official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office.
The Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts
with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting
indemnification and advances to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL
or by any other applicable law.

SECTION 5.5. _Survival of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person by this
Article V shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or
executive officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.

SECTION 5.6. _Insurance._ To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any
other applicable law, the Corporation, upon approval by the Board of
Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or
permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Article V.

 

SECTION 5.7. _Amendments._ Any repeal or modification of this Article V shall
only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Article V in
effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act
that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the Corporation.

SECTION 5.8. _Saving Clause._ If this Article V or any portion hereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and executive officer
to the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Article V
that shall not have been invalidated or by any other applicable law. If this
Article V shall be invalid due to the application of the indemnification
provisions of another jurisdiction, the Corporation shall indemnify each
director, executive officer and other designated officer to the full extent
under any other applicable law.

 

SECTION 5.9. _Certain Definitions._ For purposes of this Article V, the
following definitions shall apply:

 

(a) The term "proceeding" shall be broadly construed and shall include,
without limitation, the investigation, preparation, prosecution, defense,
settlement, arbitration and appeal of, and the giving of testimony in, any

acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in
the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan
shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation" as referred to in this Article V.
