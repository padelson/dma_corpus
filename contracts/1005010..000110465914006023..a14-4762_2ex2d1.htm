EXPLANATORY NOTE TO THIS EXHIBIT

 



 

The representations and warranties included in this Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") were made by the parties to the Merger
Agreement for their respective contractual benefit. These representations and
warranties are made as of specific dates, only for purposes of the Merger
Agreement and for the benefit of the parties thereto. These representations
and warranties are subject to important exceptions and limitations agreed upon
by the parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures, made
for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties rather
than establishing these matters as facts, and were made subject to a
contractual standard of materiality that may differ from the standard
generally applicable under federal securities laws. The Merger Agreement is
filed with this report only to provide investors with information regarding
its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information
regarding the Company or its business. Information concerning the subject
matter of the representations and warranties may have changed, and may
continue to change, since the date of the Merger Agreement, and such
subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Companys
public reports. Investors should not rely on the representations and
warranties contained in the Merger Agreement or any description thereof as
characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company,
its subsidiaries or affiliates. The information in the Merger Agreement should
be considered together with the Companys public reports filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

ARTICLE 2 
THE MERGER

 



 

Section 2.01. _The Merger_. (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall
be merged (the " **Merger** ") with and into the Company in accordance with
Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall

 



      
 

 



 

cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the " **Surviving
Corporation** ").

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the "
**Closing** ") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk
and Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as
possible, but in any event no later than five Business Days after the date the
conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, waiver of such conditions by the party or
parties entitled to the benefit thereof at the Closing) have been satisfied
or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such
other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree.

 



 

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate
of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the " **Effective Time** ") as the
certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or
at such later time as may be agreed by Parent and the Company and specified in
the certificate of merger).

 



 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

 



 

Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time:

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c) or
Section 2.04, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $48.25 in
cash, without interest (such per share of Company Common Stock amount, the "
**Merger Consideration** "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance
with Section 2.03, without interest.

 



 

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock
or owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any other direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares held for the account of clients, customers or other
Persons) shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock held by any Subsidiary of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number of
shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary
owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned
in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted, and, except as provided in Section
2.02(c), shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 2.03. _Surrender and Payment_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " **Paying Agent** ") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger
Consideration (or, in the case of Company Stock Options, an amount based
thereon) (i) certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the "
**Certificates** "), (ii) subject to Section 2.05, uncertificated shares of
Company Common Stock (the " **Uncertificated Shares** ") or (iii) Company
Stock Options, or Company Restricted Stock Units held by Non-Employee Holders.
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, cash in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient
to pay the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration (or, in the case of
Company Stock Options, the aggregate amount based thereon) to be paid in
respect of the Certificates, the Uncertificated Shares, and Company Stock
Options, Company Stock Appreciation Rights, Company Performance Shares or
Company Restricted Stock Units held by Non-Employee Holders (any funds
deposited with the Paying Agent, the " **Payment Fund** "). The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock or each Non-Employee Holder who holds Company
Stock Options, Company Stock Appreciation Rights, Company Performance Shares
or Company Restricted Stock Units at the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal and instructions in customary form (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares
to the Paying Agent and which shall include customary provisions with respect
to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock held in book-entry form) for use in such exchange.

 



 

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together
with a

 



      
 

 



 

properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents
message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer
of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company
Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. Upon such surrender,
Parent shall pay, or cause the Paying Agent to pay from the Payment Fund, the
Merger Consideration payable to each such holder pursuant to this Article 2.
Each Non-Employee Holder of Company Stock Options that have been converted
into the right to receive a cash amount in accordance with Section 2.05 shall
be entitled to receive such cash amount upon delivery of a properly completed
letter of transmittal.

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this Article 2.

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration (or, in the case of Company Stock
Options, an amount based thereon) deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock or Non-Employee Holders twelve months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options for the
Merger Consideration (or, in the case of Company Stock Options, an amount
based thereon) in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock or any Non-Employee Holder for any amounts properly paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock
that,

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to Applicable Law, would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 2.03(a) to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for
which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand.

 



 

(g) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in the Payment Fund as directed by
Parent; _provided_ that Parent shall not direct the Paying Agent to invest any
cash in the Payment Fund in any investment if such investment would, or would
reasonably be expected to, prevent or delay timely payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. In the event the
Payment Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
(or, in the case of Company Stock Options, the aggregate amount based thereon)
payable in connection with the Merger, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly deposit additional funds with the Paying
Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to
make such payment.

 



 

Section 2.04. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto
in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with
Delaware Law shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise
loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal, such shares
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any demands received prior to the Effective Time by the
Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have
the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to all such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall
not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such
demands.

 



 

Section 2.05. _Equity Awards_. (a) _Company Stock Options and Company Stock
Appreciation Rights_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock
Option and Company Stock Appreciation Right, whether vested or unvested, shall
be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay to each former holder of any such cancelled Company Stock
Option or Company Stock Appreciation Right a cash amount, if any, equal to the
product of (i) the Merger Consideration less any applicable

 



      
 

 



 

exercise price per share, and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock covered by such Company Stock Option or Company Stock Appreciation
Right, subject to reduction for any Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.07.
Each such holder will be given the opportunity to exercise his or her
outstanding Company Stock Options or Company Stock Appreciation Rights, as
applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that such
Company Stock Options or Company Stock Appreciation Rights, as applicable, are
not exercised prior to the Effective Time, such Company Stock Options or
Company Stock Appreciation Rights, as applicable, will be cancelled in
exchange for a cash payment or for no consideration, as applicable, in
accordance with this Section 2.05.

 



 

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Company Restricted Stock Unit, whether or not then exercisable or vested,
shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay to each former holder of any such cancelled Company
Restricted Stock Unit a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration, and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered
by such Company Restricted Stock Unit, subject to reduction for any Taxes
withheld pursuant to Section 2.07.

 



 

(c) _Company Performance Shares_. The performance period for each Company
Performance Share shall terminate as of (i) the date such performance period
ends in accordance with the terms of the Company Performance Share if such
date is on or earlier than the Effective Time or (ii) if such performance
period is scheduled to end after the Effective Time in accordance with the
terms of the Company Performance Share, the last business day of the completed
fiscal quarter that immediately precedes the Effective Time, and the
performance achievement for such performance period shall be determined by the
Company in accordance with Article VIII of the Companys Long Term Incentive
Program. At the Effective Time, each award of Company Performance Shares shall
be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay to each former holder of each award of Company Performance
Shares a cash amount with respect to such award equal to the product of (i)
the Merger Consideration and (ii) the greater of (A) the number of Company
Performance Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number) such holder
would have been entitled to receive based on the performance determined in
accordance with the preceding sentence for the performance period applicable
to such award, and (B) the number of Company Performance Shares (rounded down
to the nearest whole number) equal to one-third (1/3rd) of the target number
of Company Performance Shares for such award, subject to reduction for any
Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.07.

 



 

(d) _Payments through Payroll_. Any payment to which a current or former
employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company becomes

 



      
 

 



 

entitled pursuant Section 2.05, Section 2.05(b) or Section 2.05(c) shall be
made through the Surviving Corporations payroll as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay the
payments under Section 2.05, Section 2.05(b) or Section 2.05(c) payable to
holders who are not current or former employees of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company (" **Non-Employee Holders** ") in accordance with
Section 2.03. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any Company Restricted Stock
Unit or Company Performance Share that constitutes deferred compensation
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, if making the payment as
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time would subject the holder
of such Company Restricted Stock Unit or Company Performance Share to
additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made on
the date that it would be made under the applicable Equity Plan absent the
application of this Section 2.05.

 



 

(e) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors or
the compensation committee of the Board of Directors, as applicable, shall
adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are reasonably necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.05.

 



 

Section 2.06. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, subdivision or other similar transaction, or any stock dividend
thereon (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any conversion of the Company
Series A Preferred Stock and any dividend or distribution of Company Series A
Preferred Stock required to be made after the date hereof with respect to the
outstanding shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the Company
Certificate of Designations, including any Make Whole Amount (as defined in
the Company Certificate of Designations) thereunder) with a record date during
such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant
to this Agreement shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted to

respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate,
as contemplated by this Article 2.

and the Company will provide such documents to Parent not later than ten
Business Days after the date hereof.

 



 

(b) As of the date hereof, no Key Employee has provided written notice to any
executive officer of the Company that he or she presently intends to resign or
retire as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise within one year after the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) With respect to any Employee Plan covered by Subtitle B, Part 4 of Title I
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, no non-exempt prohibited transaction has
occurred that has caused or would reasonably be expected to cause the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any material liability under ERISA or the
Code. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates (nor any predecessor
of any such entity) sponsors, maintains, administers or contributes to (or has
any obligation to contribute to), or has in the past six years sponsored,
maintained, administered or contributed to (or had any obligation to

ERISA).

 



 

(d) Each Employee Plan, and any award thereunder, that is or forms part of a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A
or 457A of the Code has been timely amended (if applicable) to comply and

 



      
 

 



 

has been operated in material compliance with, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries have materially complied in practice and operation with, all
applicable requirements of Section 409A and 457A of the Code, and no amounts
currently deferred or to be deferred under any such plan would be not
determinable when otherwise includible in income under Section 457A of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to
gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any current or former Service
Provider for any Tax incurred by such Service Provider, including under
Section 409A, 457A or 4999 of the Code.

 



 

(e) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter, or has
pending or has time remaining in which to file, an application for such
determination from the IRS, and no circumstances exist that would reasonably
be expected to result in any such determination or opinion letter being
revoked or not being reissued or a penalty under the IRS Closing Agreement
Program if discovered during an IRS audit or investigation. Each trust created
under any such Employee Plan is exempt from Tax under Section 501(a) of the
Code and has been so exempt since its creation. Each Employee Plan has been
maintained in compliance with its terms and with the requirements of
Applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code, except for failures to comply or
violations that have not had and would not reasonably be expected have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. No events
have occurred with respect to any Employee Plan that could result in payment
or assessment by or against the Company of any material excise taxes under
ERISA or the Code.

 



 

(f) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, all contributions,
premiums and payments that are due have been made for each Employee Plan
within the time periods prescribed by the terms of such plan and Applicable
Law, and all contributions, premiums and payments for any period ending at or
prior to the Effective Time that are not due are properly accrued to the
extent required to be accrued under applicable accounting principles. There
has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or announcement (whether
or not written) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or
change in employee participation or coverage under, any Employee Plan that
would materially increase the expense of maintaining such plan above the level
of expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recently completed fiscal
year.

 



 

(g) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or together with any
other event) will (i) entitle any current or former Service Provider to any
material payment or benefit, including any bonus, retention, severance,
retirement or job security payment or benefit, (ii) materially enhance any
benefits or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment
of funding

 



      
 

 



 

(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or
materially increase the amount payable or trigger any other obligation under,
any Employee Plan or otherwise, or (iii) limit or restrict the right of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, after Closing, Parent, to merge, amend
or terminate any Employee Plan. There is no contract, plan or arrangement
(written or otherwise) covering any current or former Service Provider that,
individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount
that would not be deductible due to the application of Section 280G or 162(m)
of the Code.

 



 

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any current or
projected liability for, and no Employee Plan provides or promises, any post-
employment or post-retirement medical, dental, disability, hospitalization or
life benefits (whether insured or self-insured) to any current or former
Service Provider (other than coverage mandated by Applicable Law, including
the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (or COBRA)).

 



 

(i) There is no action, suit, investigation, audit, proceeding or claim (other
than routine claims for benefits) pending against or involving, or, to the
Companys knowledge, threatened against or involving any Employee Plan before
any arbitrator or any Governmental Authority, including the IRS or the
Department of Labor that, if determined or resolved adversely in accordance
with the plaintiffs demands, would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and its Subsidiaries are, and have been since January 1, 2011, in
compliance with all Applicable Laws with respect to labor relations,
employment and employment practices, including those relating to labor
management relations, wages, hours, overtime, employee classification,
discrimination, sexual harassment, civil rights, affirmative action, work
authorization, immigration, safety and health, information privacy and
security, workers compensation, continuation coverage under group health
plans, wage payment and the payment and withholding of Taxes, except for
failures to comply or violations that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(j) Each International Plan (i) has been maintained in compliance with its
terms and Applicable Law, except for failures to comply or violations that
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) if intended to qualify
for special tax treatment, meets in all material respects all the requirements
for such treatment, and (iii) if required, to any extent, to be funded, book-
reserved or secured by an insurance policy, is fully funded, book-reserved or
secured by an insurance policy, as applicable, based on reasonable actuarial
assumptions in accordance with applicable accounting principles. To the
Companys knowledge as of the date of this Agreement, the consent or
consultation of, or the rendering of formal advice by, any labor or trade
union, works council or other employee

 



      
 

 



 

representative body is not required for the Company to consummate any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has been party to or
subject to, or is currently negotiating in connection with entering into, any
Collective Bargaining Agreement. There has not been any organizational
campaign, petition or other unionization activity seeking recognition of a
collective bargaining unit relating to any Service Provider. There are
currently no, and since January 1, 2011 there have not been any, labor
strikes, slowdowns, stoppages, picketings, interruptions of work or lockouts

Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no material unfair labor
practice complaints pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened against

2011, in material compliance with WARN and has no material liabilities or
other obligations thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries

after the date of this Agreement a _bona fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal
that the Board of Directors reasonably believes will or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior

 



      
 

 



 

Proposal, and waive such Third Partys noncompliance with the provisions of
any standstill agreement to the extent necessary to permit such negotiations
or discussions and (B) furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives non-
public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to a confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided for
informational purposes only to Parent) with such Third Party on substantially
the same terms (other than standstill obligations) or terms more favorable to
the Company than those contained in the confidentiality agreement dated
November 11, 2013 between the Company and Parent (the " **Confidentiality
Agreement** "); _provided_ that all such information (to the extent that such
information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is
provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to
such Third Party); and

 



 

(ii) subject to compliance with Section 6.03(d), the Board of Directors may
make an Adverse Recommendation Change (A) following receipt of a _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors has determined
constitutes a Superior Proposal or (B) in response to material events or
changes in circumstances arising after the date hereof that were neither known
to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Board of Directors as of or prior to the
date hereof (an " **Intervening Event** "), in each case referred to in the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B) only if the Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Delaware Law. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any Adverse
Recommendation Change, until the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms (x) in no event may the Company (A) enter into any agreement in
principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument relating to an
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted under
Section 6.03(b)(i) above), or (B) without limitation of Section 6.03(b)(i)
above, make, facilitate or provide information for use by any Third Party in
any SEC or other regulatory filings in connection with the transactions
contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal, and (y) the Company shall otherwise
remain subject to all of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
from (1) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal (including any disclosure to stockholders) so long as any
action taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with this Section
6.03;

 



      
 

 



 

 _provided_ that any such action taken or statement made that relates to an
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change
unless the Board of Directors reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in
such statement or in connection with such action, (2) making any disclosure to
the Companys stockholders if the Company Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its legal advisors, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary obligations under Delaware Law,
including with respect to the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made,
the identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal or the material
terms of such Acquisition Proposal (and no such disclosure shall, taken by
itself, be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change); _provided_ that any
such disclosure that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors reaffirms the
Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure or in connection therewith, or
(3) issuing a "stop, look and listen" disclosure or similar communication of
the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act.

 



 

(c) _Required Notices_. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours or, if received on a day that is not a Business Day,
the following Business Day) after receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any indication that a Third
Party is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access
to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that, to the knowledge of the Company, may
be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the Third Party
making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request, subject to such restrictions as may exist
under confidentiality agreements as in effect on the date hereof. The Company
shall keep Parent fully informed, on a prompt basis, of any material changes
to the status, terms or conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request and shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours
after receipt or, if received on a day that is not a Business Day, the
following Business Day) provide to Parent copies of all correspondence and
written materials sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that describes any material terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(d) _"Last Look."_ Further, the Board of Directors shall not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 6.03(b)(ii) (or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i)), unless (i) the Company promptly
provides written notice to Parent, in writing at least three Business Days
before taking such action, of its intention to do so (which notice shall not
constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), attaching (A) in the case of an
Adverse

 



      
 

 



 

Recommendation Change to be made following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal
that the Board of Directors has determined constitutes a Superior Proposal,
the most current version of the proposed agreement under which such Superior
Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the Third Party
making the Acquisition Proposal, or (B) in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change to be made pursuant to an Intervening Event, a
reasonably detailed description of the underlying facts giving rise to, and
the reasons for making, such Adverse Recommendation Change, and (ii) Parent
does not make, within three Business Days after its receipt of that written
notification, a binding and irrevocable written offer that (1) in the case of
any Adverse Recommendation Change to be made following receipt of a Superior
Proposal, is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new written notification from the Company and a new three Business
Day period under this Section 6.03(d)) or (2) in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change to be made pursuant to an Intervening Event, obviates
the need for such Adverse Recommendation Change. The Company agrees that,
during any applicable three Business Day period referred to in this Section
6.03(d), the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent regarding any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent.

 



 

(e) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement, "
**Superior Proposal** " means a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal for
at least a majority of the equity or voting securities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or assets representing at least a majority of the consolidated
revenues of the Company and its Subsidiaries, that was not solicited in
violation of Section 6.03(a) in all material respects and which is on terms
that the Board of Directors determines in good faith by a majority vote, after
considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel and taking into account all the terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense
reimbursement provisions, the availability of any financing (if a cash
transaction) and conditions to consummation, are more favorable from a
financial point of view to the Companys stockholders than as provided
hereunder (taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.03(d)).

 



 

(f) _Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly request that each Third
Party, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the
24-month period prior to the date hereof in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal return or
destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or
on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and
other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that contains,
reflects or analyzes that information) as promptly as practicable, in
accordance with, and to the extent provided for in, any applicable
confidentiality agreement and subject to any contractual retention rights of
any such Third Party.

 



 

Section 6.04. _Access to Information. _From the date hereof until the
Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company shall (i) give to Parent, its counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access
(during regular business hours upon reasonable notice) to the offices,
properties, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
furnish to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives such financial and operating data and other
information as such Persons may reasonably request and (iii) instruct its
employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives to cooperate with Parent in its investigation of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. Any investigation pursuant to this Section shall be
conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. No information or knowledge
obtained by Parent in any investigation pursuant to this Section shall affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to
(A) furnish, or provide any access to, any information to any Person not a
party to, or otherwise covered by, the Confidentiality Agreement or a similar
agreement with the Company with respect to such information or (B) provide
access to or furnish any information if doing so would violate any Contract,
or where such access to information would involve the waiver or loss of an
attorney-client or work product privilege so long as the Company has
reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit such inspection of, or to disclose
such, information on a basis that does not violate such Contract or compromise
or waive such privilege with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such access and information shall be disclosed or granted, as applicable, to
external counsel for Parent to the extent reasonably required for the purpose
of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws. With respect to any information
disclosed pursuant to this Section 6.04, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall
comply with, and shall instruct their respective Representatives to comply
with, all of their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement
or any similar agreement entered into between the Company and any Person to
whom the Company or any of is Representative provides information pursuant to
this Section 6.04, and all information disclosed to Parent, Merger Subsidiary
or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall
be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. The confidentiality
obligations set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement shall

 



      
 

 



 

continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the expiration of the Confidentiality
Agreement according to its terms.

 



 

Section 6.05 _. Compensation Arrangements. _Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
or other transactions in Company Common Stock (including derivative securities
with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by Article 2 of this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act.

 



 

Section 6.06. _Certain Litigation. _The Company shall give Parent notice of
and the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
litigation (including derivative claims) against the Company and/or its
directors or executive officers relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle
any litigation commenced on or after the date of this Agreement against it or
any of its directors or executive officers relating to this Agreement, the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or otherwise, without the
prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

 



 

Section 6.07. _Company Series A Preferred Stock. _Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall cause each outstanding share of Company Series A
Preferred Stock to be converted into shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of the Company Certificate of Designation and, as of
the Effective Time, no shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock shall be
issued or outstanding.

 



 

ARTICLE 7 
COVENANTS OF PARENT

 



 

Parent agrees that:

 



 

Section 7.01. _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.02. _Director and Officer Liability_. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of
the Company (each, an " **Indemnified Person** ") in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent
provided under the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect
on the date hereof or any indemnity agreements between the Company and its
present and former officers in effect as of the date hereof, and, with respect
to any currently serving directors and officers of the Company, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be jointly and severally liable to pay and perform
in a timely manner such obligations; _provided_ that such indemnification
shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable
Law and such indemnity agreements.

 



 

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in the Companys certificate
of incorporation and bylaws in existence on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to obtain and fully pay the premium for a non-cancellable extension (or
"tail") of the Companys directors and officers insurance policies and
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " **D andO
Insurance**") in place as of the date hereof, in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time (such period, the " **Tail Period** "), with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as those
contained in the Companys DandO Insurance policies in effect as of the date
hereof. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain
such "tail" policies in full force and effect through such six year period. If
the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, then from the Effective
Time through the end of the Tail Period, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the Companys current DandO
Insurance covering each Person currently covered by the Companys DandO
Insurance for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time with
respect to any matter claimed against such Person by reason of him or her
serving in the applicable capacity on terms with respect to such coverage and
amounts no less favorable than those of such DandO Insurance policies in effect
on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that if the aggregate cost for such
insurance coverage exceeds 200% of the current annual premium paid by the
Company (which amount is set forth in Section 7.02(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule), the Surviving Corporation shall

 



      
 

 



 

instead be obligated to obtain DandO Insurance with the best available coverage
with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for an
aggregate cost of 200% of the current annual premium.

 



 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.02.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.02 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 



 

Section 7.03 _. Employee Matters._ (a) During the period beginning at the
Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, Parent shall, or
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to each employee who is actively
employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (each, a "
**Covered Employee** ") and who is located primarily (i) in the United States,
compensation and benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to the compensation and benefits (other than equity compensation and other
long-term incentives, change in control, retention, transition, stay or
similar arrangements) that were provided to such Covered Employee under the
Employee Plans set forth on Section 4.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) outside the United States,
compensation and benefits that, as determined by Parent in its sole
discretion, either (x) were provided to such Covered Employee under the
Employee Plans set forth on Section 4.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
immediately prior to the Effective Time or (y) are provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and
its Subsidiaries).

 



 

(b) Without limiting paragraph (a) of this Section 7.03, during the period
beginning at the Effective Time and ending on June 30, 2014, Parent shall
cause the Company to continue to perform the Companys obligations with
respect to any Covered Employee who is covered by the ENTrigue severance
policy in accordance with the terms of such policy, as such terms are set
forth on Section 7.03(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) _Crediting of Payments_. In the event any Covered Employee first becomes
eligible to participate under any employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " **Parent Plan** ")
following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use reasonable best efforts to: (i) waive any preexisting condition
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such Covered Employee under any Parent Plan
providing medical, dental or vision benefits to the same extent such
limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Employee Plan such
Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under such
Parent Plan and (ii) provide such Covered Employee with credit for any
copayments and deductibles paid under an Employee Plan prior to such Covered
Employees coverage under any Parent Plan during the calendar year in which
such amount was paid, to the same extent such credit was given under the
Employee Plan such Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to
coverage under such Parent Plan in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under such Parent Plan.

 



 

(d) _Service Crediting_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, recognize all service of each Covered Employee
prior to the Effective Time, with the Company and its Subsidiaries for vesting
and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes, except for
vacation and severance, as applicable). In no event shall anything contained
in this Section 7.03 result in any duplication of benefits for the same period
of service.

 



 

(e) _Company 401(k) Plan_. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least five Business
Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the Companys
Retirement Savings and Investment Plan, pursuant to resolutions of the Board
of Directors that are reasonably satisfactory to Parent. In connection with
the termination of such plan, Parent shall permit each Covered Employee to
make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, but excluding all participant
loans) in cash in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution
portion of the account balance distributed to each such Covered Employee from
such plan to an "eligible retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) _ESPP_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors or the
appropriate committee thereof shall take all actions, including adopting any
resolutions or amendments, with respect to the Companys Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the " **ESPP** ") to: (i) cause the "Offering Period" (as
defined in the ESPP) ongoing as of the date of this Agreement to be the final
Offering Period under the ESPP and the options under the ESPP to be exercised
on the earlier of (x) the scheduled purchase date for such Offering Period and
(y) the date that is seven Business Days prior to the Effective Time (with any
participant payroll

 



      
 

 



 

deductions not applied to the purchase of shares returned to the participant),
(ii) prohibit participants in the ESPP from increasing their payroll
deductions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement and (iii)
terminate the ESPP effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(g) _Employee Data_. Not later than ten Business Days after the date hereof
and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Company will provide Parent
with a schedule that sets forth, for each employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, his or her name, title, annual base salary, most recent
annual bonus received, current annual bonus opportunity, employer, hire date,
location, whether full- or part-time and whether active or on leave (and, if
on leave, the nature of the leave and the expected return date). Five Business
Days prior to the Effective Time and to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, the Company will provide Parent with a revised version of the schedule
described in the immediately preceding sentence, updated as of ten Business
Days prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(h) _Labor Groups_. The parties agree to work together in good faith to
consult with or obtain the consent of any labor or trade union, works council
or other employee representative body as may be required to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(i) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.06, nothing in this Section
7.03, express or implied, (i) is intended to or shall confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto, including any Covered Employee or any former
employee, director, officer or individual independent contract of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, (ii) shall establish, or
constitute an amendment, termination or modification of, or an undertaking to
amend, establish, terminate or modify, any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, (iii) shall alter or limit the ability of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (or, following the Effective Time, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them or (iv) shall create any obligation on the part of
Parent or its Subsidiaries (or, following the Effective Time, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries) to employ any Covered Employee for any period
following the Effective Time.

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

 



 

The parties hereto agree that:

 



 

Section 8.01. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Company, Parent Holdco and Parent shall use

 



      
 

 



 

their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
Applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable and no later than the End Date, including (i)
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any Governmental
Authority or other Third Party all documentation to effect all necessary
filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtaining and
maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations
and other confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental
Authority or other Third Party that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by
defending, contesting and resisting any actual or threatened claim, suit,
action, objection or other proceeding brought by a Governmental Authority or
other Third Party challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of any Applicable Law, including Antitrust Laws, and seeking to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the End Date or which would materially impair or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided
that the parties hereto understand and agree that the reasonable best efforts
of any party hereto shall not be deemed to include (A) entering into any
settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, or (B) divesting or otherwise holding separate (including by
establishing a trust or otherwise), or taking any other action (or otherwise
agreeing to do any of the foregoing) with respect to any of its or the
Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates
businesses, assets or properties (any such action in the foregoing clause (A)
or (B), a " **Burdensome Condition** "), other than the Agreed Actions. For
the avoidance of doubt, without the prior written consent of Parent, the
Company shall not offer, propose or agree to any Burdensome Condition,
including any Agreed Action. " **Agreed Actions** " means negotiation of and
entry into a non-exclusive license on a worldwide basis with one or two third
parties (in no case shall this provision require licenses that would allow
more than one third party to manufacture or have manufactured, or sell or have
sold, products in overlapping fields of use), for use solely in the field of
radiofrequency energy in the sports medicine field of use, with respect to any
or all of the following: (i) all of the "Coblation" patents licensed by the
Company or its Affiliates to Parent or its Affiliates enabling a third party
to have manufactured or supplied, under commercially reasonable terms, the
same products that Parent or its Affiliates have manufactured or supplied as
of the Effective Time, and improvements thereto by the third party, under
existing agreements with the Company or its Affiliates, and any other patents
of Parent or its Affiliates, in each case to the extent embodied in Parents
or its Affiliates "DYONICS RF" products as of the

 



      
 

 



 

Effective Time, (ii) all patents owned or licensed by Parent and its
Affiliates to the extent embodied in their "E-FLEX" products at the Effective
Time, and improvements thereto by the third party, (iii) intellectual property
(excluding trademarks, trade names, brand names and domain names) and
technical, development and other related information and files, in each case
to the extent related to any research and development efforts by Parent and
its Affiliates that exist prior to the Effective Time with respect to new
products or technology of Parent and its Affiliates using radiofrequency
energy in the sports medicine field of use, and (iv) all patents owned or
licensed by Parent and its Affiliates as of the Effective Time to the extent
embodied in other products, and improvements thereto by the third party, (
_i.e._ , other than those covered in clauses (i) and (ii) but not the Excluded
Products) of Parent and its Affiliates using radiofrequency energy in the
sports medicine field of use; _provided_ that in no event shall Parent or its
Affiliates be required to license patents embodied in any such other product
under this clause (iv) to the extent that the product associated with such
patents, individually or taken together with all other products associated
with patents licensed pursuant to this clause (iv), represented more than US
$40 million of aggregate consolidated revenues of Parent Holdco for the twelve
months ended November 30, 2013 (for the avoidance of doubt, revenues
associated with products incorporating "Coblation" intellectual property and
with "DYONICS RF" products shall not be included for purposes of calculating
the aggregate consolidated revenues in this clause (iv)) (all of the products
described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the DYONICS RF, E-FLEX, SCULPTOR and SAPHYRE product lines
and Parents and its Affiliates RF consumables, the " **Covered Products**
"), and (v) know-how, design history files, technical information and related
documentation and intellectual property owned or licensed by Parent and its
Affiliates as of the Effective Time related to the Covered Products which are
reasonably necessary to allow a licensee to register, make, use and sell
Covered Products, and to make improvements to the Covered Products, on a
worldwide basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) in no event shall the
Covered Products include (x) the Companys or its Affiliates products
utilizing temperature sensing technology or (y) "ELECTROBLADE" (the products
described in (x) and (y) collectively, the " **Excluded Products** ") and (B)
to the extent that any third partys consent is required in connection with
the Agreed Actions the parties shall only be required to take commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such consents. "Agreed Actions" shall also
include negotiation of and entry into transitional technical support
agreements, transitional manufacturing or interim supply agreements and other
ancillary agreements that Governmental Authorities customarily require in
connection with settlements, undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations and
other agreements related to Antitrust Laws that involve licenses of
intellectual property, to the extent reasonably necessary to permit a licensee
to enter into the manufacture and sale of Covered Products on a worldwide
basis. For the

 



      
 

 



 

avoidance of doubt, as used in the definition of "Agreed Actions," Parent and
its Affiliates excludes the Company and its Affiliates.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement and shall make
such other filings or submissions with Governmental Authorities in the
jurisdictions set forth in Section 9.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
as promptly as practicable, and supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act or such other Antitrust Laws and shall use their reasonable
best efforts to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and the
receipt or occurrence of approvals, consents, registrations, permits,

any of its Affiliates upon the termination of this Agreement, (vi) cooperation
with respect to matters relating to pledges of collateral to take effect at

with one another (i) in connection with the preparation of the Company Proxy

contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) in taking such actions or making any
such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith or with
the Company Proxy Statement and seeking timely to obtain any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers. Subject to Section 6.04 and Applicable Law,
each of Parent and the Company shall, upon request by the other, furnish the
other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and equityholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable in connection with any statement, filing,

Third Party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the

pursuant to this Agreement that is not intended for use in the Company Proxy
Statement or related filings, the Company shall be bound by the
confidentiality obligations (but not the other obligations) set forth in the

or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Company Proxy Statement promptly
after receipt of those comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the Companys response to those comments and to
provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith
consideration shall be given), including by participating with the Company or
its counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC.

Company shall consult with each other before, directly or indirectly through
any Representatives, issuing any press release, having any communication with

securities exchange or association, shall not issue any such press release,
have any such communication with the press or make any such other public
statement or schedule or participate in any such press conference or scheduled
conference call without the consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in connection with any action by the Company or the Board of
Directors contemplated by Section 6.03(b), the Company shall not be required
to consult with or obtain the consent of Parent prior to issuing any press
release or otherwise making public announcements in compliance with Section
6.03(b).

other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in

acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger.

Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to any
Section of this Agreement or that relate to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 



      
 

 



 

(d) upon the senior executives of such party becoming aware of the occurrence,
or non-occurrence, of any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the obligations of any party
to effect the Merger set forth in Article 9 not to be satisfied.

 



 

Section 8.06 _. De-listing; Deregistration. _ Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to

shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary and the respective members
of their boards of directors shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
use reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and to take such actions
as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated herein and otherwise to take all such other actions as are
reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such statute
or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar such Taxes and fees
(including penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by Article 2.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Termination Fee_.

 



 

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i)
or Section 10.01(c)(ii), or by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i),
then the Company shall pay to Parent Holdco in immediately available funds
$54,900,000 (the " **Termination Fee** ") in order to compensate Parent Holdco
for the loss of opportunity or rights under this Agreement and expenses
incurred in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
Parent Holdco after the date hereof. Such payment shall be made, in the case
of a termination by Parent, within one Business Day after such termination
and, in the case of a termination by the Company, immediately before and as a
condition to such termination ( _provided_ that Parent has provided wire
instructions with respect to such payment and otherwise promptly following
receipt of such wire instructions).

 



 

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(b)(i) or Section 10.01(b)(iii), (B) after the date of this
Agreement and prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have
been publicly announced and not publicly and unconditionally withdrawn at
least five (5) Business Days prior to (x) the date of termination, in the case
of a termination pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i) or (y) the Company
Stockholder Meeting, in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
10.01(b)(iii), (C) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
10.01(b)(i), at the time of such termination the condition set forth in
Section 9.01(a) shall not have been satisfied, and (D) within nine (9) months
following the date of such termination, the Company shall have entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to or recommended to its stockholders an
Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated (
_provided_ that for purposes of this clause (ii), each reference to "15%" in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to
"50%"), then the Company shall pay to Parent Holdco in immediately available
funds, concurrently with the occurrence of the applicable event described in
clause (D), the Termination Fee in order to compensate Parent Holdco for the
loss of opportunity or rights under this Agreement and expenses incurred in
furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by Parent
Holdco after the date hereof.

 



 

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated
to pay, or cause to be paid, the Termination Fee on more than one (1)
occasion.

 



 

(c) _Other Costs and Expenses_. Each party acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in Section 11.04(b) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the amounts payable pursuant
to Section 11.04(b) are not a penalty or liquidated damages, (iii)
notwithstanding anything to

 



      
 

 



 

the contrary in this Agreement, except as set forth in the last sentence of
this Section 11.04(c), in the event that any Termination Fee is paid or
payable pursuant to Section 11.04(b), Parents right to receive payment of the
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and its
Affiliates and Representatives against the Company and its Affiliates and
Representatives under this Agreement or arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and upon payment of such
amount, none of the Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall
have any liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case whether based on
contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by
any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or
applicable Laws or otherwise and (iv) without the agreements contained in
Section 11.04(b) and this Section 11.04(c), Parent and the Company would not
have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, (A) if the Company fails to
promptly pay the Company Termination Fee when due pursuant to Section 11.04(b)
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in
a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 11.04(b),
the Company shall pay to Parent reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Parent in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate of
Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date of payment.

 



 

Section 11.05 _. Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References. _(a) The
parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of either the

relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this
Agreement and (ii) any other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) of such party that is contained in this Agreement, but only if the
relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes
of) such representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) would be
reasonably apparent to a reasonable person who has read that reference.

 



 

(b) In no event shall any predictive, cautionary or forward-looking statements
contained in any part of any Company SEC Document entitled "Risk Factors" or
containing a description or explanation of "Forward-Looking Statements" be
deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) any
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement.

any rights, benefits,

 



      
 

 



 

remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, other than (i) as
provided in Section 7.02 and (ii) at and after the Effective Time, the rights
of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger

part, to (i) one or more of its Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the
Effective Time, to any Person; provided that such transfer or assignment (x)
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder,
alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or
Merger Subsidiary and (y) shall not be permitted if it would result in any
increase in withholding under Section 2.07.

or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter

Affiliates or against any party or any of its controlled Affiliates) shall be
brought in the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware or other
Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to
the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process

oral or written agreement or other communication).

 



 

Section 11.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter thereof.

 



 

Section 11.12. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest

Section 11.13. _Guarantee_. (a) Parent Holdco irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantees the due and punctual performance of the obligations of Parent,

diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing objections with a court, any
right to require proceeding first against Parent, Merger Subsidiary the
Surviving Corporation or any such permitted assign, any right to require the
prior disposition of the assets of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any such

demands whatsoever. This is a guarantee of payment and performance and not
collectability.
