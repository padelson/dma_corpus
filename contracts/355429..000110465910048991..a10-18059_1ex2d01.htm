 **Section 1.4.** ** ****_Purchase Price Adjustment_**.

  



  

(a) At least thirty (30) days prior to the expected Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement, using the same accounting
methods, policies, practices and procedures used in the preparation of the
Companys Statutory Statements (the **_"Preliminary Closing Adjusted
Net Worth Statement"_** ), consisting of (i) the balance sheet of the
Company as of the close of business on the last day of the calendar
quarter immediately preceding the Closing Date included with the Companys
Statutory Statement as of such date and adjusted to give effect on a pro
forma basis to the transactions contemplated to occur at or prior to the
Closing by this Agreement and by the Transaction Agreements, (ii) a
calculation in reasonable detail of the Companys Adjusted Statutory Book
Value, derived from such balance sheet, and made pursuant to the procedures
set forth on **_Schedule 1.4(a)_** (the **_"Preliminary Adjusted Statutory
Book Value"_** ) and (iii) a calculation of the amount, if any, by which the
Closing Payment will be increased or reduced pursuant to _Section 1.3_. For
illustrative purposes only, **_Schedule 1.4(b) _**contains a sample balance
sheet of the Company derived from the balance sheet contained in the
Statutory Statement of the Company as of June 30, 2010 and giving effect on a
pro forma basis to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Transaction Agreements to occur following June 30, 2010 (including those that
have occurred prior to the date hereof), but prior to Closing.

  



  

(b) Not later than seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
(i) cause a schedule to be prepared as of the Closing Date using the same
accounting methods, policies, practices and procedures used in the
preparation of the Companys Statutory Statements (the " ** _Final Closing
Adjusted Net Worth Statement_** "), which shall include Buyers calculations,
as of the Closing Date, of the Companys Adjusted Statutory Book Value, and
(ii) deliver copies of the proposed Final Closing Adjusted Net Worth
Statement to Seller. The " ** _Adjusted Statutory Book Value_** " means, as
of the applicable date, the total capital and surplus of the Company as
calculated pursuant to the procedures set forth on **_Schedule 1.4(a)_**.

  



  

(c) Within thirty (30) days following the delivery of the proposed Final
Closing Adjusted Net Worth Statement to Seller, Seller may object to the
calculation of the Adjusted Statutory Book Value, or to any portion thereof,
each as contained in the proposed Final Closing Adjusted Net Worth Statement.
Any such objection (the  ** _"Notice of Dispute"_** ) 

  



        
   

  



  

shall be in writing delivered to Buyer and shall (i) state that Seller
believes the Final Closing Adjusted Net Worth Statement contains errors or
was not prepared in accordance with the accounting methods, policies,
practices and procedures used in the preparation of the Companys Statutory
Statements or as set forth on **_Schedule 1.4(a)_** , (ii) specify in
reasonable detail each item that Seller disputes (each, a " ** _Disputed
Item_** "), the reasonably estimated amount in dispute for each such Disputed
Item and the reasons supporting Sellers positions and (iii) Sellers
determination of the amount of the Adjusted Statutory Book Value. If Seller
fails to deliver a valid Notice of Dispute within the prescribed period, the
proposed Final Closing Adjusted Net Worth Statement delivered by Buyer with
respect to the Company pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_ shall be the applicable
Final Closing Adjusted Net Worth Statement for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Upon receipt of a Notice of Dispute, Buyer and Seller shall, for a period
of twenty (20) days following delivery of such notice, seek in good faith to
resolve all Disputed Items and agree on the amount of the Adjusted Statutory
Book Value.  If Buyer and Seller reach an agreement with respect to any
Disputed Items, Buyer shall revise the Final Closing Adjusted Net Worth
Statement to reflect such agreement. If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree
on the resolution of a Disputed Item (each, an **_"Unresolved Item"_**
) within such twenty (20) day period, each of Buyer and Seller shall, within
fifteen (15) business days after the conclusion of such twenty (20) day
period, prepare and submit to the other party and to Ernst and Young LLP or, if
Ernst and Young LLP is unable or unwilling to act in such capacity, a
nationally recognized independent registered public accounting firm that has
not had a material relationship with Buyer, Seller, Seller Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates within the last two years) (the
**_"Arbitrator"_** ) its proposed applicable Final Closing Adjusted Net Worth
Statement together with a statement of its position with respect to the
Unresolved Items and the calculation of the amount of Adjusted Statutory Book
Value. The Arbitrator shall, after the submission of such information by
Buyer and Seller, review the calculation of the Unresolved Items; _provided_
, that the Arbitrator (i) shall conduct such review based solely on
presentations by Buyer and Seller and not by independent review, (ii) only
review the Unresolved Items and (iii) shall be limited to those adjustments,
if any, required to be made for the Final Closing Adjusted Net Worth
Statement to comply with the provisions of this Agreement. The Arbitrator
shall make a determination with respect to the Unresolved Items only and in a
manner consistent with this _Section 1.4_, and in no event shall
the Arbitrators determination of an Unresolved Item be for an amount that
is outside the range of Buyers and Sellers disagreement. Buyer and Seller
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Arbitrator to
issue its written determination with respect to the Unresolved Items to Buyer
and Seller within thirty (30) days after submission of the Unresolved Items
to the Arbitrator, and the Final Closing Adjusted Net Worth Statement as
adjusted based on the Arbitrators determination with respect to the
Unresolved Items shall, absent manifest error, be the Final Closing Adjusted
Net Worth Statement with respect to the Company for purposes of this _Section
1.4_. Each party shall grant the Arbitrator reasonable access to such partys
and such partys Affiliates books and records relevant to the preparation of
the Final Closing Adjusted Net Worth Statement. Any determination by
the Arbitrator with respect to any disputes regarding the Final Closing
Adjusted Net Worth Statement shall be final and binding on the parties hereto
absent manifest error. The costs of the Arbitrator shall be split equally by
Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other.

  



        
   

  



  

(e) On or before the fifth (5th) business day following the final
determination of the Final Closing Adjusted Net Worth Statement either (i)
Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount, if any, by which the Adjusted Statutory
Book Value shown on the Final Closing Adjusted Net Worth Statement is less
than the Adjusted Statutory Book Value shown on the Preliminary Closing
Adjusted Net Worth Statement or (ii) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount, if
any, by which the Adjusted Statutory Book Value shown on the Final Closing
Adjusted Net Worth Statement is greater than the Adjusted Statutory Book
Value shown on the Preliminary Closing Adjusted Net Worth Statement. Any
amount paid in respect of adjustments to the Purchase Price made pursuant to
this _Section 1.4_ shall be increased by interest accrued on such amount,
compounded daily, at the Federal Funds Rate from the Closing Date to and
including the date of payment, based on a 365-day year. The **_"Federal Funds
Rate"_**  means, for any day, the rate per annum equal to the weighted
average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with members of
the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers on such day, as
published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the business day next
succeeding such day; _provided_ , that if such day is not a business day, the
Federal Funds Rate for such day shall be such rate on such transactions on
the next preceding business day as so published on the next succeeding
business day.

  



  

(f) In the event of the occurrence of a Valuation Closing Date, the value of

the period from January 1, 2010 to the Closing Date, and in any other state,
local and foreign consolidated, affiliated, combined, unitary or other
similar group Tax Returns that include Seller or any Affiliate of Seller and

or otherwise agreed to by Buyer prior to the filing thereof. Any such Tax
Returns on which the Companys address is required to be provided (including

the Company) shall use the Companys address determined by Buyer by notice to
Seller. Any Tax Returns relating to the Company that are prepared by Seller
or an Affiliate of Seller pursuant to clause (ii) of the second sentence of

filing such Tax Returns (other than payroll and premium Tax Returns, which
shall be submitted not less than five (5) business days prior to the due date
for filing) for review and approval by Buyer, which approval may not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, and such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice and shall be complete and correct in all
material respects.

  



  

(b) Any Taxes with respect to the Company that relate to a Straddle Period
shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer, (i) in the case of property
Taxes (and any other Taxes not measured or measurable, in whole or in part,
by net or gross income or receipts), on a _per diem_ basis and, (ii) in the
case of other Taxes, as determined from the books and records of the Company
during the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date **(** _i.e._
, Sellers portion **)** and the portion of such period beginning on the day
following the Closing Date **(** _i.e._ , Buyers portion **)** consistent
with the past practices of Seller and the Company.  Buyer shall cause the
Company to file any Tax Returns for any Straddle Period, and Buyer shall pay,
or cause to be paid, all state, local or foreign Taxes shown as due on any

 _Section 5.1(b)_) due pursuant to the filing of any such Tax Returns under
the provisions of this _Section 5.1(b)_ within ten (10) business days of
receipt of notice of such filing by Buyer, which notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the calculations regarding Sellers share of such Taxes.

  



  

(c) Neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller shall, without the prior
written consent of Buyer, file, or cause to be filed, any amended Tax Return
or claim for Tax refund, with respect to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, to the extent that any such filing may affect in any material respect
the Tax liability of Buyer, any of its Affiliates or the Company for any Tax
Period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date (including the
imposition of Tax deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis or cost
adjustments, the lengthening of any amortization or depreciation periods, the
denial of amortization or depreciation deductions, or the reduction of loss
or credit carryforwards).

  



  

(d) Any and all existing Tax sharing, allocation, compensation or like
agreements or arrangements, whether or not written, that include the Company,
including any arrangement by which the Company makes compensating payments to
any other member of any affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or other
similar Tax group for the use of certain Tax attributes, shall be terminated
(or the Company shall be released from all liabilities and obligations
thereunder) on or prior to the Closing Date (pursuant to a writing executed
on or before the Closing Date by all parties concerned) and shall have no
further force or effect with respect to the Company and the Company
shall have no further rights thereunder for any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
Straddle Period or Tax Period beginning on or after the Closing Date. All
liabilities of the Company to Seller or any Affiliate of Seller and all
liabilities of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller to the Company (for Taxes or
otherwise pursuant to such agreements or arrangements) shall be canceled on
or prior to the Closing Date. Any and all powers of attorney relating to Tax
matters concerning the Company other than for periods prior to the
Closing Date shall be terminated as to the Company on or prior to the Closing
Date and shall have no further force or effect.

  



  

(e) After the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall provide each other, and
Buyer shall cause the Company to provide Seller, with such cooperation and
information (including, for the avoidance of doubt, work papers) relating to
the Company as either party reasonably may request in (i) filing any Tax
Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, (ii) determining any Tax
liability or a right to refund of Taxes, (iii) conducting or defending any
audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes or (iv) effectuating the terms
of this Agreement. The parties shall retain, and Buyer shall cause the
Company to retain, all returns, schedules and work papers with respect to
Taxes, and all material records and other documents relating thereto, for a
period of six (6) years following the filing of the Tax Return, or until such
later date as shall be requested in writing by Seller or Buyer, as
applicable, no later than six (6) months prior to the expiration of such six
year period, unless such Tax Returns and other documents are offered and
delivered to Seller or Buyer, as applicable. Any information obtained under
this _Section 5.1_ shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return, or
claim for refund, determining any Tax liability or right to refund of Taxes,
or in conducting or defending any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Seller nor Buyer, nor any of
their respective Affiliates, shall be required to prepare any document, or
determine any information not then in its possession, in response to a
request under this _Section 5.1(e)_.

  



        
   

  



  

(f) Seller or its Affiliates shall be entitled to all Tax refunds of the
Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period except for Tax refunds attributable to
carrybacks from Tax Periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date. If Buyer or the Company on the one hand, or Seller or any of its
Affiliates on the other hand, receives any Tax refund to which the other
party is entitled pursuant to this _Section 5.1(f)_, the recipient of such
Tax refund will promptly pay (or cause the Company or such Affiliate, as the
case may be, to pay) the amount of such Tax refund to the other party net of
the reasonable out-of-pocket costs to such recipient with respect to such Tax
refund; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any Tax refund to which
Seller or its Affiliates is entitled pursuant to this _Section 5.1(f)_ and
for which Buyer or the Company must file a Tax Return to claim such Tax
refund, Seller shall (i) at Sellers expense, prepare such Tax Return (with
the reasonable cooperation of Buyer), and (ii) provide such Tax Return to
Buyer for review and approval, which approval may not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice and shall be complete and correct in
all material respects. If Seller has complied with the terms of the
immediately preceding proviso, Buyer shall file such Tax Return. In the event
that any such Tax refund is subsequently disallowed in whole or part by any
Tax Authority, Seller or an Affiliate of Seller shall promptly return any
such amounts received thereby to Buyer or the Company.

  



  

(g) _Election Under Section 338(h)(10)_.

  



  

(i) Seller Parent and Buyer shall make, or cause to be made, a joint
election for the Company under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and under
any applicable similar provisions of state law with respect to the purchase
of the Shares (all such elections being referred to collectively as a " **
_Section 338(h)(10) Election_**"). Each of Seller Parent and Buyer will
duly execute, or cause to be executed, IRS Form 8023 (or any comparable form
required for purposes of making such elections under state Law) and
such forms shall be delivered to the other party at or prior to the
Closing Date. If any changes are required in these forms as a result of
information which is first available after these forms are prepared, the
parties will promptly agree on such changes.

  



  

(ii) Within sixty (60) days following the determination of any Purchase
Price Adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.4_, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a schedule (the **" _Proposed_ _Allocation Schedule_
"**) allocating the "aggregate deemed sales price", as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.338-4 and the "aggregate grossed up basis", as defined
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-5, in compliance with
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.338-6, 1.337-7 and 1.338-11, as applicable.
For purposes of determining the fair market value of investment securities,
Buyer shall determine fair market value in the same manner as that used for
purposes of determining the Investment Grade Securities Market Value
Adjustment and the Non-Investment Grade Securities Market Value Adjustment
reflected on **_Schedule 1.4_** , except that such determination shall be
made as of the close of business on the Closing Date and not the Valuation
Closing Date, if applicable. Furthermore, Buyer shall compute the fair
market value of the insurance in-force under Treasury Regulation Section
1.338-11 by first determining the present value of the distributable earnings
of Company based on statutory reserves, and then adjusting such amount by the
excess of the statutory reserves over the reserves computed for Tax purposes.
Buyer shall provide to Seller its

  



        
   

  



  

determinations of fair market value for each class of assets deemed sold
pursuant to the Section 338(h)(10) Election used in determining the amounts
reflected in the Proposed Allocation Schedule and in sufficient detail for
Seller to validate such allocation, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer shall not be required
to disclosure any proprietary methods, information or calculations to Seller.
The Proposed Allocation Schedule shall be deemed to be accepted by and shall
be conclusive and binding on Seller except to the extent, if any, that Seller
shall have delivered within thirty (30) days after the date on which the
Proposed Allocation Schedule is delivered to Seller, a written notice to
Buyer stating each and every item to which Seller, reasonably and in good
faith, takes exception (it being understood that any amounts not disputed
shall be final and binding). If no exception is taken to the
Proposed Allocation Schedule, it shall become the " ** _Final Allocation
Schedule_ "** and shall be binding upon the parties and each of Buyer and
Seller shall file and cause their respective Affiliates to file all federal,
state, local and foreign Tax Returns in accordance with the Final Allocation
Schedule.  If a change proposed by Seller reasonably and in good faith is
disputed by Buyer, then Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve such dispute. If, after a period of twenty (20) days following the
date on which Seller gives Buyer notice of any such proposed change, any such
proposed change still remains disputed, then each of Buyer and Seller may
file their respective IRS Forms 8883 (and any comparable forms for state
purposes) on the basis of the Proposed Allocation Schedule, in the case of
Buyer and on the basis of the Proposed Allocation Schedule (but
reflecting Sellers exceptions), in the case of Seller.  Each of Buyer and
Seller shall file and cause their respective Affiliates to file all federal,
state, local and foreign tax Returns in accordance with the allocations set
forth in such Schedules.

  



  

(iii) Pursuant to the Election Statement attached hereto as _Exhibit
G_, Seller and Buyer hereby elect to determine specified policy
acquisition expenses without regard to the general deductions limitation of
Section 848(c)(1) of the Code in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.848-2(g)(8) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.197-2 (g)(5)(ii)(C)(4) with
respect to each deemed reinsurance contract between (x) the corporation that
is deemed to transfer, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.338-1(a)(1), all of its assets as a consequence of the Section 338(h)(10)
Election with respect to the Company and (y) the corporation that is deemed
to acquire, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-1(a)(1), all of
its assets as a consequence of the Section 338(h)(10) Election with respect
to the Company, that results from the Section 338(h)(10) Election and from
Treasury Regulation Section 1.848-2(f)(7) and Treasury Regulation Section
1.197-2(g)(5)(ii)(C)(2).

  



  

(h) Each of Buyer and Seller shall promptly notify the other party in writing
upon receipt by Buyer or Seller, any of their Affiliates, or the Company, as
the case may be, of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local
or foreign Tax audits, examinations or assessments relating to taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date or that might otherwise affect
the Tax liabilities for which Seller may be liable pursuant to _Section
9.4_, _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyers failure to promptly notify Seller
of any such audits, examinations or assessments shall not affect Buyers or
the Companys right to be indemnified under this Agreement unless Seller
shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure.

  



        
   

  



  

(i) Seller shall have the sole right to represent the Companys interests in
any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxes for
which Seller is liable pursuant to _Section 9.4_, and to employ counsel of
its choice at its expense, _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to any
audit or proceeding that could result in an increase in any Tax liability of
the Company or Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates for which Seller
is not liable pursuant to _Section 9.4_, Seller shall keep Buyer informed as
to the status of such audit or proceeding (including providing copies of all
notices received from any Tax Authority) and, subject to such control and
upon Buyers reasonable request, shall discuss with Buyer and Buyers counsel
any position that Seller intends to take with regard to Tax matters
pertaining to the Company (that could result in an increase of the Tax
liability of the Company or Buyer or any of their Affiliates for which Seller
would not be liable under _Section 9.4_), and afford Buyer and Buyers
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment in advance on any
written submission to be made by Seller with regard to Tax matters pertaining
to the Company (that could increase the Tax liability of the Company or Buyer
or any of their respective Affiliates for which Seller is not liable pursuant
to _Section 9.4_), and _provided_ , _further_ , Seller may not enter into
any settlement that could increase any Tax liability of the Company or Buyer
or any of their Affiliates for which Seller is not liable pursuant to
_Section 9.4_ without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent may
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the case of a Straddle Period,
Seller shall be entitled to participate at its expense in any Tax audit
or administrative or court proceeding relating (in whole or in part) to
Taxes attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date and, with the written consent of Buyer (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and at Sellers sole
expense, may assume the entire control of such audit or proceeding.  None of
Buyer, any of its Affiliates, or the Company may settle any Tax claim for any
Taxes for which Seller is liable pursuant to _Section 9.4_, without the
prior written consent of Seller.

  



  

 **Section 5.2.** ** ****_Transfer Taxes_** **.** Each of Seller, on the one

change, effect or circumstance that occurs or arises after the Valuation
Closing Date is disproportionate to the Company or Business relative to other
similarly situated businesses shall not be deemed to result in a Material
Adverse Effect) or (b) a material adverse change or effect on the ability of
Seller or any of its Affiliates to perform timely their obligations under
this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements.

of Related Party Agreements_** **.** Seller shall have caused

other hand, other than the Coinsurance and Administration Services Agreement

Party Agreements_** "), shall have been terminated.

  



  

 **Section 6.5.** ** ****_Resignations_** **.** Each officer and director of

 **ARTICLE IX _ 
 INDEMNIFICATION_**

  



  

 **Section 9.1. _Indemnifiable Claims_.**

  



  

(a) Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer and any Affiliate of Buyer and
their respective officers and directors, harmless from and against (x) any
and all liability, claim, loss, cost, damage or expense whatsoever (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses but excluding any special,
consequential or punitive damages except to the extent awarded against a
Claimant pursuant to a claim by a third-party) (collectively, " **
_Damages_** ") resulting from or arising out of (i) any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained herein, (ii) any
breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company, Seller or Seller Parent
contained herein or (iii) any Excluded Liability, and (y) fifty percent
(50%) of any Damages resulting from or arising out of the matters set forth
in **_Schedule 9.1(a)_**.

  



  

(b) Buyer shall and hereby does indemnify and hold Seller and the Affiliates
of Seller and their respective officers and directors harmless from and
against any and all Damages resulting from or arising out of: (i) any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation

  



        
   

  



  

or warranty of Buyer contained herein; or (ii) any breach of any covenant or
obligation of Buyer contained herein.

  



  

 **Section 9.2. _Notice of Claim_.**

  



  

(a) A Person that may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.1_ (a " ** _Claimant_** ") in respect of a claim under _Section 9.1_ (an "
** _Indemnifiable Claim_** "), shall notify promptly the party or parties
against whom it makes an Indemnifiable Claim for such indemnification (such
notified party or parties, the " ** _Indemnifying Parties_** ") in writing of
the institution of such claim (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Parties from any liability the Indemnifying Parties may have
except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying
Party). Upon receipt of a claim for indemnity from a Claimant pursuant to
this _Section 9.2_ in respect of a pending or threatened claim or demand by
a third party that the Claimant has determined has given or would reasonably
be expected to give a right of indemnification under this Agreement, unless
otherwise agreed to by the Claimant, the Indemnifying Parties shall assume
and direct the defense of such action, including the employment of counsel,
and all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with defending or
settling the Indemnifiable Claim shall be borne solely by the Indemnifying
Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to
the Claimant in the exercise of its reasonable judgment and that the
Indemnifying Parties shall not compromise any claim without the prior written
consent of the Claimant, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.  If the Indemnifying Parties shall undertake to compromise or defend
any such asserted liability, they shall promptly notify the Claimant of their
intention to do so, and the Claimant agrees to cooperate reasonably with the
Indemnifying Parties and their counsel in the compromise of, or defense
against, any such asserted liability. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 9.2(a)_ to the contrary, the Claimant shall have the right to
employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such action or
proceeding, and the Indemnifying Parties shall bear the reasonable fees,
costs and expenses of such separate counsel (and shall pay such fees, costs
and expenses at least quarterly), if (a) the use of counsel chosen by the
Indemnifying Parties to represent the Claimant would present such counsel
with a conflict of interest; (b) the defendants in, or targets of, any such
action or proceeding include both a Claimant and an Indemnifying Party, and
the Claimant shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses
available to it or to other Claimants which are different from or additional
to those available to the Indemnifying Parties (in which case the
Indemnifying Parties shall not have the right to direct the defense of such
action or proceeding on behalf of the Claimant); or (c) an Indemnifying Party
shall authorize the Claimant to employ separate counsel at the expense of the
Indemnifying Parties.  All costs and expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with a Claimants cooperation shall be borne by the Indemnifying
Parties. In any event, the Claimant shall have the right, at its own expense,
to participate in the defense of such asserted liability.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 9.2(a)_, in respect of a pending or threatened
claim or demand by a third party that Buyer has determined has given or would
reasonably be expected to give a right of indemnification under _Section
9.1(a)(y)_, unless otherwise agreed to by Buyer, Buyer shall assume and
direct the defense of such action, including the employment of counsel, and
Seller and Buyer shall each bear on a current basis fifty percent (50%) of
all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with defending or
settling the Indemnifiable Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such counsel
shall be satisfactory to Seller in the exercise of its

  



        
   

  



  

reasonable judgment and that Buyer shall not compromise any claim without the
prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. If Buyer shall undertake to compromise or defend any
such asserted liability, it shall promptly notify Seller of its intention to
do so, and Seller agrees to cooperate reasonably with Buyer and its counsel
in the compromise of, or defense against, any such asserted liability.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.2(b)_ to the contrary, Seller
shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the
defense of such action or proceeding at its own expense.

  



  

 **Section 9.3. _Limitation of Indemnification._**

  



  

(a) _Time Limitation_. No claim or action shall be brought under this
_Article IX_ for any inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty
contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement by any Indemnifying Party
after the lapse of eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date. Regardless
of the foregoing, however, or any other provision of this Agreement:

  



  

(i) There shall be no time limitation on claims or actions brought for any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in
or pursuant to _Sections 2.1_ , _2.2_ , _2.3_ ,  _2.4_ or _2.27_ and Seller
hereby waives all applicable statutory limitation periods with respect
thereto.

  



  

(ii) There shall be no time limitation on claims or actions brought for any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in or
pursuant to _Sections 3.2_ or _3.6_ , and Buyer hereby waives all applicable
statutory limitation periods with respect thereto.

  



  

(iii) Any claim or action made pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(y)_,  _Section
9.4_ or for any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
made by Seller in or pursuant to Sections _2.13_  or _2.17_ may be made at
any time prior to thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitation; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any
claim or action made under _Section 9.4(b)_ for any inaccuracy in or breach
of any representation or warranty made by Seller in or pursuant to _Sections
2.26(xvi)_ or _(xvii)_ such claim or action may not be brought after the
lapse of twenty-four (24) months following the Closing Date.

  



  

(iv) If any act, omission, disclosure or failure to disclose shall form the
basis for a claim for any inaccuracy in or breach of more than one
representation or warranty, and such claims have different periods of
survival hereunder, the termination of the survival period of one claim shall
not affect a partys right to make a claim based on the inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty still surviving.

  



  

(b) _Amount Limitation_. Subject to the immediately following sentence (a) no
party shall be entitled to indemnification under _Section 9.1(a)(x)(i)_ or 
_9.1(b)(i)_ with respect to any claim for indemnification unless
the aggregate amount of all Damages resulting from such claims exceeds an
amount equal to one percent (1.0%) of the Purchase Price (the **_"Basket
Amount"_** ), at which time amounts of such Damages in excess, but only in
excess, of the Basket Amount may be recovered as provided in this _Article
IX_, and (b) the aggregate liability of Seller

  



        
   

  



  

under _Sections 9.1(a)(x)(i)_ and Buyer under _Section 9.1(b)(i)_
for indemnification shall not exceed an amount equal to fifteen percent
(15.0%) of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 9.3(b)_, the provisions of this _Section 9.3(b)_ will not
apply to (x) the obligations of Seller to indemnify Buyer and any Affiliate
of Buyer in connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in _Sections 2.1_ , _2.2_
, _2.3_ , _2.4_ or _2.27_  or (y) the obligations of Buyer to indemnify
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller in connection with any inaccuracy in or
breach of the representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in _Sections
3.2_ or _3.6_.

  



  

(c) _Calculation on an After-Tax Basis_. In calculating any Damages, other
than any Damages attributable to liabilities for Taxes pursuant to _Section
9.4_, such amount shall be calculated on an After-Tax Basis and shall be net
of any third-party insurance, indemnification or other proceeds that either
have been recovered by, or are recoverable by, the Claimant under any
insurance policy or other contract, agreement or undertaking in connection
with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification.  The term **"
_After-Tax Basis_ "** shall mean that, in determining the amount of the
payment necessary to indemnify any party against, or reimburse any party for,
Damages, the amount of such Damages shall be determined by taking into
account any Tax benefit derived (or reasonably expected to be derived) by the
Claimant (or any Affiliate thereof) as the result of sustaining or paying
such Damages (including as the result of facts or circumstances due to which
the Claimant sustained or paid such Damages) and any Tax cost or detriment
incurred (or reasonably expected to be incurred) by the Claimant (or any
Affiliate thereof) as a result of any payment received (or expected to be
received) pursuant to this _Article IX_. Such Tax benefits and costs or
detriments shall be computed assuming that the Claimant (or such Affiliate)
is subject to taxation at an invariant income tax rate equal to thirty-five
percent (35%), and that any such Tax benefits are fully utilized in the
taxable period during which such Damages are sustained or paid.

  



  

(d) _Certain Qualifiers_. For purposes of this _Article IX_, any inaccuracy
in or breach of any representation or warranty shall be determined without
regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualification,
and without regard to any qualification or requirement that a matter be or
not be "reasonably expected" to occur, contained in or otherwise applicable
to such representation or warranty.

  



  

 **Section 9.4. _Tax Indemnification_.** Seller shall and hereby does
indemnify and hold Buyer and any Affiliate of Buyer and their respective
officers and directors, harmless from and against any and all Damages
attributable to liabilities of the Company: (a) for Taxes attributable to
Pre-Closing Tax Periods as determined pursuant to _Section 5.1_, (b)
arising from any inaccuracy in or breach of representations or warranties set
forth in _Section 2.26_ or any breach of the covenants in _Section 5.1_,
(c) for Taxes attributable to the Company having been a member of
any affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or other similar group
(under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign law) prior to the Closing Date, (d) for Taxes that
are imposed by reason of the Company having liability for Taxes of another
Person as a result of the Company being during any Pre-Closing Tax Period a
successor or transferee of any other Person or by contract, (e) for Taxes
attributable to any of the Pre-Closing Affiliate Transactions described in
_Section 4.4_ or the deemed sale of assets and liquidation of the Company
for any applicable Tax purposes pursuant to the Section 338(h)(10) Election,
and (f) for Sellers proportionate share of any Taxes described in _Section
5.2_.  With respect to any claim

  



        
   

  



  

for indemnity under this _Section 9.4_ arising from any inaccuracy in or
breach of the representations set forth in _Sections 2.26(b)(xvi)_ or
_2.26(b)(xvii)_ , but subject to the provisions of  _Section 9.3(a)(iii)_,
Buyer shall notify Seller promptly if it becomes aware of any such inaccuracy
in or breach in the above representations regardless of whether any Tax
Authority or any other third party has made any assertion or taken any action
with respect to such inaccuracy in or breach of such representations, and
such notice shall contain all material facts relating to such inaccuracy in
or breach of such representations. Seller shall review such notice and
within thirty (30) days, determine, in good faith, whether remediation of
such inaccuracy or breach is required, and if it determines remediation is
required, shall propose to Buyer the basis upon which such inaccuracy in or
breach of such representations shall be remedied.  Buyer shall either accept
Sellers proposal or offer an alternative proposal. If Buyer offers an
alternative proposal, Seller shall either accept or reject such alternative
proposal. If after negotiating in good faith, Seller and Buyer cannot agree
whether remediation is required or upon the method of remediation, the period
in which a claim or action may be made pursuant to this  _Section 9.4_
solely with respect to the matter described in the above notice shall be the
applicable period of the statute of limitation plus thirty (30) days
notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 9.3(a)(iii)_. If the method of
remediation has been agreed to by the parties, Seller shall have primary
responsibility (with the reasonable cooperation of Buyer) for the remediation
on behalf of the Company and may employ counsel and other third parties of
its choice and at its expense. Seller shall keep Buyer informed as to the
status of such remediation and shall discuss with Buyer and Buyers counsel
any steps to be taken in the remediation and afford Buyer and Buyers counsel
the right and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment in advance on
any document or other written agreement to be entered into on behalf of the
Company. Seller shall not (a) send any communication or documents to any
policyholders of the Company without the consent of Buyer or (b) enter into
any agreement with respect to the remediation without the consent of Buyer,
which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (and it shall be
deemed unreasonable to withhold such consent if such agreement is consistent
with the plan of remediation agreed to by Seller and Buyer).
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may, at any time and regardless
of whether a method of remediation has been agreed by the parties, assume
control of the process of remediating any inaccuracy in or breach of
the representations set forth in _Sections 2.26(b)(xvi)_ or _2.26(b)(xvii)_
, and may take any action in connection therewith without the cooperation
or consent of Seller; _provided_ , that Buyer and the Company shall
have waived any right to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such inaccuracy or breach.

  



  

 **Section 9.5. _Mitigation_.** The parties shall cooperate with each other
with respect to resolving any Indemnifiable Claim, including by making
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such Indemnifiable
Claim; _provided_ that any costs to the Claimant of such mitigation shall be
borne by the Indemnifying Party. Each party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to address any claims or liabilities that may provide a
basis for an Indemnifiable Claim such that each party shall respond to any
claims or liabilities in the same manner it would respond to such claims or
liabilities in the absence of the indemnification provisions of this
Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 9.6. _Treatment of Payments_.** All payments made pursuant
to this _Article IX_ shall be treated as the payment of additional purchase
price or a refund of a portion of the Purchase Price, as the case may be, in
the year such payment is made.

  



         
 

  

 ** **

  

 **Section 9.7. _Exclusive Remedy_.** Except in the event of fraud
or willful misconduct or as provided by _Section 4.12(c)_ or the last
sentence of this _Section 9.7_, from and after the Closing Date, the rights
and remedies under this _Article IX_ shall be deemed to be exclusive of all
other rights and remedies that would otherwise be available to the parties
hereto; that is, each party hereto expressly waives the right, whether by
contract or under law to the extent legally permissible to do so, to seek
damages from or against or otherwise assert claims against the other
party hereto or its assets or its successors or assigns other than pursuant
to this _Article IX_. No course of dealing by either party, or any delay or
omission of either party in exercising any rights or remedies under this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right or remedy. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each of the parties hereto, shall have the right to enforce
their respective rights hereunder by an action or actions for specific
performance, injunction or similar equitable remedies.
