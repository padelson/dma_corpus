 SECTION 1.03.  _Interpretation_. The language in this Agreement is to be construed in all cases according to its fair meaning. Dai-ichi and Protective acknowledge and agree that each Party and its counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and that any rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting Party or the Party in favor of which a clause has been drafted or in favor of the Party who has committed itself in a clause, is not to be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever used herein, the words "include," "includes" and "including" mean "include, without limitation," "includes, without limitation" and "including, without limitation," respectively. The masculine, feminine or neuter gender and the singular or plural number 

        

are each deemed to include the other whenever the context so indicates. The
use of "or" is not intended to be exclusive unless expressly indicated
otherwise. The word "days" means calendar days unless otherwise specified.
Time periods within or following which any payment is to be made or act is to
be done will, unless expressly indicated otherwise, be calculated by excluding
the day on which the period commences and including the day on which the
period ends and by extending the period to the next Business Day following if
the last day of the period is not a Business Day. The words
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole (including any Exhibits,
Schedules and the Parties\' disclosure letters) and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement, and all Article, Section, Exhibit and Schedule
references are to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. Where this
Agreement states that a Party "shall," "will" or "must" perform in some
manner or otherwise act or omit to act, it means that the Party is legally
obligated to do so in accordance with this Agreement. Any reference to a
statute, rule or regulation is deemed also to refer to any amendments or
successor legislation as in effect at the relevant time. Any reference to a
Contract or other document as of a given date means the Contract or other
document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time through such
date. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. The Protective Disclosure Letter and the
Dai-ichi Disclosure Letter, as well as all other schedules and exhibits
hereto, will be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference to
this Agreement. Whenever this Agreement provides that documents or
information have been "made available" to Dai-ichi, Merger Sub or their
Representatives, such documents or information will be deemed to have been so
made available if (a) at least two Business Days prior to the date of this
Agreement, they were filed as exhibits to the SEC Documents and publicly
available on the internet website of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ ") or (b) not later than the last Business Day prior to the date
of this Agreement, they were posted in the electronic data room
entitled "Project Pearl" maintained at Merrill DataSite to which Dai-ichi,
Merger Sub and their Representatives have been granted access by Protective,
except, in each case, to the extent the contents of such documents were
redacted.

  

ARTICLE II 
THE MERGER AND CERTAIN RELATED MATTERS

  

 SECTION 2.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Protective and the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease. Protective will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (as such, the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") as a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Dai-ichi and will continue to be governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Protective and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Protective and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 SECTION 2.02.  _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Baker and McKenzie, LLP, 452 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10018, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the date when the Effective Time is to occur (the " _Closing Date_ "). 

  

 SECTION 2.03. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Dai-ichi and Protective will file a certificate of merger as contemplated by the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the DGCL. The Merger will become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date, or at such other time as Dai-ichi and Protective may agree and specify in the Certificate of 

        

Merger. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed
by Dai-ichi and Protective, Dai-ichi and Protective will cause the Effective
Time to occur not later than the fourth Business Day after all of the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ have been fulfilled or waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions). As
used in this Agreement, the " _Effective Time_ " means the time at which the
Merger becomes effective.

  

 SECTION 2.04.  _Surviving Corporation Constituent Documents_. At the Effective Time, (a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation will be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A_ (the " _Surviving Corporation Certificate of Incorporation_ "), and as so amended and restated, will be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and the DGCL and (b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will be amended and restated to read in their entirety as set forth in _Exhibit B_, and as so amended and restated, will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms, the terms of the Surviving Corporation Certificate of Incorporation, as may be amended, and the DGCL 

  

 SECTION 2.05.  _Surviving Corporation Directors and Officers_. 

  

 (a) The directors of Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and will hold office from the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or otherwise as provided by applicable Law. 

  

 (b) The officers of Protective in office immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and will hold office from the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or otherwise as provided by applicable Law. 

   

 SECTION 2.06. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Dai-ichi, Merger Sub, Protective or the holders of any of the following securities: 

  

 (a) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into and will thereafter represent the right to receive $70.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ " and in the aggregate for all shares of Common Stock, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). 

   

 (b) Each share of Common Stock owned by Dai-ichi or Protective or their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries (" _Excluded Shares_ "), in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be canceled without any conversion thereof, and the Per Share Merger Consideration will not be paid with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if and to the extent required by the DGCL, shares of Common Stock which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders of such shares of Common Stock who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive in lieu of the Merger Consideration payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be 

        

treated as if they had been converted into and to have become exchangeable
for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section 2.06(c)_, if this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Effective Time, then the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair
value of such stockholder\'s Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL will cease. Protective will give Dai-ichi (i) prompt notice of
any written demands received by the Protective for appraisal of Dissenting
Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to the DGCL which are received by Protective relating to such holder\'s
rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Protective
will not, except with the prior written consent of Dai-ichi, make any payment
with respect to any demand for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such
demands, and Dai-ichi will not commit to make any such payment or enter into
any such settlement prior to the Effective Time without the prior written
consent of Protective.

  

 (d) Each share of the common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one fully paid and non assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (e) If after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Protective pays a dividend in, splits, combines into a smaller number of shares, or issues by reclassification any shares of Common Stock (or undertakes any similar act), then the Per Share Merger Consideration will be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of the Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and as so adjusted will, from and after the date of such event, be the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this provision. 

  

 (f) From and after the Effective Time, the Common Stock converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.06_ will no longer remain outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate previously representing any such Common Stock or shares of Common Stock that are in non-certificated book-entry form (either case being referred to in this Agreement, to the extent applicable, as a " _Certificate_ ") will thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such Common Stock except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions as provided in _Section 3.01(e)_. 

  

 SECTION 2.07. _Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards_. 

  

 (a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each stock appreciation right with respect to shares of Common Stock granted under any Stock Plan (each, a " _SAR_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and that has a base price per share of Common Stock underlying such SAR (the " _Base Price_ ") that is less than the Per Share Merger Consideration (each such SAR, an " _In-the-Money SAR_ "), whether or not exercisable or vested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, determined by multiplying (i) the excess of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the Base Price of such In-the-Money SAR by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money SAR (such amount, the " _SAR Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, each SAR that has a Base Price that is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, whether or not exercisable or vested, will be cancelled and the holder of such SAR will not be entitled to receive any payment in exchange for such cancellation. 

  

 (b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted share unit with respect to a share of Common Stock granted under any Stock Plan (each, a " _RSU_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, determined by multiplying (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration by (ii) the number of RSUs (such amount, the " _RSU Consideration_ "). 

        

 (c) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of performance shares earned for each award of performance shares granted under any Stock Plan will be calculated by determining the number of performance shares that would have been paid if the subject award period had ended on the December 31 immediately preceding the Effective Time (based on the conditions set for payment of performance share awards for the subject award period), provided that the number of performance shares earned for each award will not be less than the aggregate number of performance shares at the target performance level, and provided further that with respect to awards granted in the year in which the Effective Time occurs, performance shares will be earned at the same percentage as awards granted in the year preceding the year in which the Effective Time occurs. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each performance share so earned (each, a " _Performance Share_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, determined by multiplying (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration by (ii) the number of Performance Shares (such amount, the " _Performance Share Consideration_ "). 

  

 (d) Dai-ichi will cause the Surviving Company to pay the SAR Consideration, RSU Consideration and Performance Share Consideration, less any amounts required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any applicable Law, at or reasonably promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five Business Days after the Effective Time, through the payroll system of the Surviving Company; _provided_ that, if payment of any such amount is subject to a deferral election, payment will be made in accordance with the terms specifed in such applicable election. 

  

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Protective (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering any Stock Plan) will adopt such resolutions or take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting to terminate each Stock Plan and any relevant award agreements applicable to each Stock Plan, and to cancel any Equity Rights that are outstanding and unexercised, whether or not vested or exercisable, at the Effective Time, subject to the right of the holders of such Equity Rights as provided in this _Section 2.07_. 

  

ARTICLE III

 SECTION 3.01. _Surrender and Payment_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Dai-ichi will appoint a U.S. bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Protective (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for Merger Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than two Business Days following the Effective Time, Dai-ichi will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of Common Stock as of the Effective Time, whose shares of Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of transmittal (which will specify that the delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent) in such form as Protective and Dai-ichi may reasonably agree, including instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Dai-ichi will cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock, an amount of cash in United States dollars sufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.06_, payable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_. All cash deposited with the Exchange Agent is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent will, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the appropriate Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund will not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent will invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Dai-ichi; _provided_ that no such investment or losses thereon will affect the Merger Consideration payable to holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration and Dai-ichi will promptly cause to be provided additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration in the amount of any such losses. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be the property of, and paid to, Dai-ichi. 

       

                                    

  

 (c) Each holder of shares of Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in the amount, if any, that such holder has the right to receive in cash pursuant to _Section 2.06_ and this _Article III_. The Merger Consideration will be paid as promptly as practicable (by mail or, to the extent commercially practicable, made available for collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder of a Certificate) after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Certificate and letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. 

  

 (d) If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it will be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment will pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the making of such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or will establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it will be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration will pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (e) After the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers of shares of Common Stock outstanding prior to the Effective Time other than as provided for in _Section 2.06(d)_. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent or Dai-ichi, they will be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Article II_ and this _Article III_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation is obligated to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by Protective with respect to shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. 

  

 (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Common Stock one year after the Effective Time will be returned to Dai-ichi, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his or her shares of Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article III_ prior to that time will thereafter look only to Dai-ichi for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holder\'s shares of Common Stock. 

  

 (g) Neither Dai-ichi, the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent will be liable to any former holder of Common Stock for any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to any Government Authority pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. In the event any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the date as of which such Certificate or the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender thereof escheats to or otherwise becomes the property of any Governmental Authority, Dai-ichi, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent will be permitted to comply with such Laws and the Merger Consideration otherwise payable upon the surrender of such Certificate will be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Common Stock represented by such Certificate. 

        

 SECTION 3.02.  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Dai-ichi, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Dai-ichi may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Common Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by _Article II_ and this _Article III_. 

  

 SECTION 3.03.  _Withholding Rights_. Dai-ichi, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger such amounts as Dai-ichi, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority or Taxing Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 SECTION 3.04.  _Further Assurances_. After the Effective Time, the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Protective, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of Protective, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

No other Takeover Laws or provisions in the Constituent Documents of Protective, including Article VII of Protective\'s certificate of incorporation, 

        

having such effect are applicable to the Merger, this Agreement, or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

  

 SECTION 4.06.  _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. 

   

 (a) Assuming that all Approvals of or from, or Filings with, Governmental Authorities described in _Section 4.06(b)_ and _Section 5.04(b)_ have been obtained or made, and that the Stockholder Approval is obtained, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Protective does not and the consummation by Protective of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) conflict with any provisions of the Constituent Documents of Protective or any Protective Subsidiary, (ii) violate any Law or Order, (iii) result, after the giving of notice, with lapse of time, or otherwise, in any violation, default or loss of a benefit under, or permit the acceleration or termination of any obligation under or require any consent under, any Contract, (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any properties or assets of Protective or any Protective Subsidiary or (v) cause the suspension or revocation of any Permit of Protective or any Protective Subsidiary, except, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), any matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

The consolidated balance sheets (including the related notes) included in the Financial Statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position of Protective and the Protective Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of stockholders\' equity and consolidated statements of cash flows (in each case including the related notes) included in such Financial Statements present fairly in all 

        

material respects the results of operations, stockholders\' equity and cash

 (e) The audit committee of the Board of Directors of Protective has established "whistleblower" procedures that meet the requirements of Exchange Act Rule 10A-3 in all material respects, and has made available to Dai-ichi accurate and complete copies of such procedures.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Protective makes no representation or warranty with respect to information supplied in writing by Dai-ichi, Merger Sub or any Representative or Affiliate of Dai-ichi or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act.

 (a) Each of Protective and the Protective Subsidiaries hold all material Permits necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses or ownership of their respective assets and properties, except where failure to hold Permits, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of Protective and the Protective Subsidiaries is in compliance with the terms of the Permits, except where non-compliance, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Protective nor the Protective Subsidiaries has received at any time since January 1, 2011 any notice or other written communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any actual or threatened revocation, withdrawal, suspension, cancellation, termination or material modification of any Permit, except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 (e) Protective\'s "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Protective in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to Protective\'s principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Protective required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency" and "material weakness" will have the meanings assigned to them in Appendix A of Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect on the date of this Agreement. Protective\'s current outside auditors have confirmed to Protective in writing that they are independent registered certified public accountants as required by the Exchange Act and the rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

None of the Protective Insurance Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of Protective, any reinsurer under any Protective Reinsurance Contract is insolvent or the subject of a rehabilitation, liquidation, conservatorship, receivership, bankruptcy or similar proceeding and the financial condition of any such reinsurer is not impaired to the extent that a default thereunder is reasonably anticipated, except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No notice of intended cancellation has been received by the Protective Insurance Subsidiary from any such reinsurer, and there are no disputes under any Protective Reinsurance Contract, except for cancellations or disputes that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, no Protective Reinsurance Contract contains any provision providing that any party thereto (other than Protective or any Protective Subsidiary) may terminate, cancel or commute the same by reason of the consummation of the Merger. 

  

 SECTION 4.24. _Insurance Reserves; Actuarial Reports_. 

  

 (a) The reserves for benefits, losses (including incurred but not reported losses and losses in course of settlement), claims, expenses and unearned premium arising under or in connection with the Insurance Contracts (collectively, " _Insurance Reserves_ ") contained in the Protective Statutory Statements (i) were based on assumptions and methodologies that were in accordance with or more conservative than those called for in the provisions of the relevant Insurance Contracts, (ii) were determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial standards consistently applied throughout the specified period and the immediately prior period, (iii) are fairly stated in accordance with sound actuarial principles and SAP and (iv) satisfied the requirements of all applicable Laws with respect to the establishment of reserves and are at least as great as the minimum aggregate amounts required by 

        

applicable Law. Protective does not make any representation or warranty in
this Section 4.24 or in any other provision of this Agreement to the effect
that the Insurance Reserves will be sufficient or adequate for the purposes
for which they were established or that such Insurance Reserves may not
develop adversely or, subject to _Section 4.23_, that the reinsurance
recoverables taken into account in determining the amount of the Insurance
Reserves will be collectible.

  

 (b) Protective has made available to Dai-ichi an accurate and complete copy of any material actuarial reports prepared by third-party actuaries with respect to any Protective Insurance Subsidiary from January 1, 2011 (or such later date as the applicable Protective Insurance Subsidiary became a Subsidiary of Protective) through the date of this Agreement, and all attachments, addenda, supplements and modifications thereto (the " _Protective Actuarial Analyses_ ").

 SECTION 4.25.  _Insurance Contracts_. The Insurance Contracts are, and since January 1, 2011 have been, to the extent required under applicable Law, on forms and at rates approved by applicable Governmental Authorities or filed and not objected to by such Governmental Authority within the period provided for objection, in each case except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 SECTION 4.26.  _Distributors_. 

  

 (a) Each of the Protective Insurance Subsidiaries, each of the Affiliated Distributors and, to the Knowledge of Protective, each of their respective Independent Distributors are and have been since January 1, 2011, in connection with the Insurance Contracts, in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws regulating the marketing and sale of life insurance policies and annuity contracts, regulating advertisements, requiring mandatory disclosure of policy information, requiring employment of standards to determine if the purchase of a policy or contract is suitable for an applicant, prohibiting the use of unfair methods of competition and deceptive acts or practices and regulating replacement transactions. For purposes of this _Section 4.26(a)_, (i) "advertisement" means any material designed to create public interest in life insurance policies and annuity contracts or in an insurer, or in an insurance producer, or to induce the public to purchase, increase, modify, reinstate, borrow on, surrender, replace or retain such a policy or contract and (ii) "replacement transaction" means a transaction in which a new life insurance policy or annuity contract is to be purchased by a prospective insured and the proposing producer knows or should know that one or more existing life insurance policies or annuity contracts will lapse, or will be forfeited, surrendered, reduced in value or pledged as collateral. 

   

 (b) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, since January 1, 2011 (i) each Affiliated Distributor and, to the Knowledge of Protective, each Independent Distributor, at the time that such Distributor wrote, sold or produced any Insurance Contract, was duly licensed, authorized and appointed (for the type of business written, sold or produced by such Distributor) in the particular jurisdiction in which such Distributor wrote, sold or produced such business, and no such Distributor violated any term or provision of applicable Law relating to the writing, sale or production of such business in any material respect, (ii) no Affiliated Distributor and, to the Knowledge of Protective, no Independent Distributor has breached the terms of any agency or broker Contract with Protective, any Protective Insurance Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates in any material respect or violated any applicable Law or policy of Protective, any Protective Subsidiary or any such Affiliate in the solicitation, negotiation, writing, sale or production of such business in any material respect and (iii) no Affiliated Distributor and, to the Knowledge of Protective, no Independent Distributor has been enjoined, indicted, convicted or made the subject of any consent decree or judgment on account of any violation in any material respect of any applicable Law in connection with such Distributor\'s actions in his, her or its capacity as 

        

a Distributor for the Insurance Contracts, and there exists no enforcement or

 (a) Each Separate Account is (i) duly and validly established and maintained in compliance in all material respects with applicable Law and (ii) is operating and, at all times since January 1, 2011 (or, if later, the date of its establishment), has been operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable Law. 

  

 (b) Each Separate Account is either duly registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, and such registration is in full force and effect, or is excluded from the definition of "investment company" pursuant to Section 3(c)(1), 3(c)(7) or 3(c)(11) of the Investment Company Act. Each Separate Account that is registered under the Investment Company Act is, and since January 1, 2011 has been, operated in compliance with the Investment Company Act, has filed all reports and amendments of its registration statement required to be filed, has been granted all exemptive relief necessary to conduct its operations as currently conducted, and is in compliance with all conditions to any such relief, except, in each case, as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Insurance Contracts under which Separate Account assets are held are duly and validly issued and are either exempt from registration under the Securities Act or were sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, and such registration statement is currently in effect to the extent necessary to allow the applicable Protective Insurance Subsidiary to receive contributions under such Insurance Contracts. Since January 1, 2011, the relevant registration statements, at the time that each became effective, contained no untrue statement of a material fact, and did not omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading. 

   

 (c) Since January 1, 2011, each prospectus, offering document, sales brochure, sales literature or advertising material, as amended or supplemented, relating to any Separate Account, as of their respective mailing dates or dates of use, complied in all material respects with applicable Law, including U.S. federal and state securities Laws and Insurance Laws. Since January 1, 2011, all advertising or marketing materials relating to a Separate Account that were required to be filed with FINRA or any other Governmental Authority have been or will be timely filed therewith, except where such failure to comply, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 SECTION 4.28. _Product Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) The Tax treatment of each Insurance Contract is not, and since the time of issuance or subsequent modification has not been, less favorable to the purchaser, policyholder or intended beneficiaries thereof, than the Tax treatment either that was purported to apply in written materials provided by the issuer of such Insurance Contract, in each case at the time of its issuance (or any subsequent modification of such Insurance Contract) or for which such Insurance Contract would reasonably have been expected to qualify at the time of issuance (or subsequent modification), in each case except where the failure to have such Tax treatment, individually or in the aggregate, is not, and would not reasonably be expected to be, material to the issuer of any such Insurance Contract. The issuer of any Insurance Contract has no reason to believe that the Tax treatment of any such Insurance Contract will at any time be less favorable to the purchaser, policyholder or intended beneficiaries thereof than the Tax treatment either that was purported to apply in written materials provided by the issuer of such Insurance Contract, in each case at the time of its issuance (or any subsequent modification of such Insurance Contract), or for which any such Insurance Contract would reasonably have been expected to qualify, at the time of issuance (or subsequent modification), except where the failure to have such tax treatment would not be material to any such issuer. 

        

 (b) The issuer of each Insurance Contract maintains systems that are adequate to maintain compliance with qualification provisions of the Code, including Sections 7702 and 7702A of the Code, and to comply with the withholding and reporting requirements of the Code applicable to the Insurance Contracts, including Sections 3405 and 6047 of the Code, except where failure to maintain such systems would not be material to any such issuer.

Since January 1, 2011, there have been no material violations or, to the Knowledge of 

        

Protective, allegations of material violations of such code of ethics,
insider trading policies and material policies.

  

 (e) The officers and employees of Protective and the Protective Subsidiaries who are required to be approved, licensed or registered as investment advisory representatives for the activities conducted by them on behalf of Protective and the Protective Subsidiaries are and at all times since January 1, 2011 have been duly approved, licensed or registered in each state or jurisdiction in which and with each Governmental Authority with whom such approval, licensing or registration is so required, except where the failure to be so approved, licensed or registered, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (f) Each ERISA client to which a Protective Adviser provides investment management, advisory or sub-advisory service has, since January 1, 2011, been managed or advised by such Protective Adviser such that the exercise of such management or provision of such advisory services is in compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable requirements of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code and (ii) the applicable Contract.

Each Protective Broker-Dealer is a member of FINRA and such other organizations in which its membership is required in order to conduct its business as now conducted, except as , individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Protective has made available to Dai-ichi accurate and complete copies of each Protective Broker-Dealer\'s Form BD as most recently filed with the SEC and all state registration forms, each as amended to the date of this Agreement. The information contained in each such form was accurate and complete in all material respects at the time of filing and each Protective Broker-Dealer has made all amendments to such form as it is required to make under any applicable Law, except as , individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Each of the Golden Gate Contracts is valid and binding on Protective or the applicable Protective Subsidiary that is a party thereto, as the case may be, and to the Knowledge of Protective, each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect, except, in each case, as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors\' rights generally and by general principles of equity.

Protective has made available to Dai-ichi accurate and complete copies of each such Golden Gate Contract (including all modifications and amendments thereto and any material waivers by Protective or the applicable Protective Subsidiary thereunder).

With respect to any reinsurance agreement included in the Golden Gate Contracts for which any Protective Insurance Subsidiary has taken credit on a balance sheet included within the Protective SAP Statements, such taking of credit was in compliance with the applicable Law of the Protective Insurance Subsidiary\'s domiciliary state. No Golden Gate Contract contains any provision providing that any party thereto (other than Protective or a Protective Subsidiary) may terminate, cancel or commute the same by reason of the consummation of the Merger. 

  

 (c) Since the date of this Agreement, The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has not changed its accreditation standards, and there has not been any change in statutory accounting principles or applicable Law (including model Laws) adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, in either case that: (A)(i) relates to the use of captive reinsurers as a means of financing statutory reserves associated with level premium term life insurance policies and universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantee or (ii) changes the required treatment under SAP of the financings effected through the Golden Gate Contracts; and (B) after giving effect to any measures that have been taken by Protective or any of its Affiliates, or Dai-ichi or any of its Affiliates, pursuant to _Section 6.09(d)_ to mitigate the effects of any such change, has had a material adverse effect on the statutory financial condition of the Protective Insurance Subsidiaries that are cedants under the Golden Gate Contracts, taken as a whole, as would be reflected in financial statements of such Protective Insurance Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with applicable SAP as of the Closing Date.

 (c) Protective will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as practicable after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that Protective may commence mailing the Proxy Statement. Each of Protective and Dai-ichi will take all actions reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the Merger and will furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. 

  

 (d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Parties, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by any of the Parties which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Parties will file as promptly as practicable with the SEC a mutually acceptable (as reasonably determined by the Parties) amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement and, as required by Law, disseminate the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of Protective. 

  

 SECTION 6.03.  _Stockholders Meeting; Recommendation_.

Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that Protective does not provide access or information in reliance on the immediately preceding sentence, it will provide notice to Dai-ichi that it is withholding such access or information and will use reasonable efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or risk waiver of such privilege. 

  

 (c) All information furnished pursuant to this _Section 6.04_ or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement will be subject to the confidentiality agreement dated as of April 12, 2014 between Protective and Dai-ichi (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). No investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.04_ will affect the representations, warranties or conditions to the obligations of the Parties contained in this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 6.05.  _Acquisition Proposals_. 

  

 (a) During the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 29, 2014 (such period, the " _Solicitation and Early Signing Period_ " and such date, the " _No Shop Period Start Date_ "), Protective and its Representatives will have the right to (i) initiate, solicit, facilitate or encourage any inquiry or the making or announcement of any proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal and (ii) participate or engage in or continue any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to any Person any information or data with respect to, or otherwise cooperate with or take any other action to facilitate any proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal. Any non-public information relating to Protective and the Protective Subsidiaries furnished to any such Person will be furnished pursuant to and in accordance with a written confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality terms that are no more favorable in the aggregate than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as amended by the terms of this Agreement) (any such confidentiality agreement, an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "). No Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement may contain any provision that would prevent Protective from complying with its obligation to provide any disclosure to Dai-ichi required pursuant to this _Section 6.05(a)_, _Section 6.05(d)_ or _Section 6.05(h)_. All information provided or made available by Protective or any Protective Subsidiary to any Person entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement that has not been previously provided or made available to Dai-ichi must be provided or made available by Protective concurrently with, or, if impractical, within 48 hours following, the time it is provided or made available to such Person. From the tenth day following the date of this Agreement through the No Shop Period Start Date, Protective will provide a written report to Dai-ichi every five Business Days setting forth (i) the total number of 

        

Persons contacted to date pursuant to this _Section 6.05(a)_, (ii) the

enter into discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) the number of
Persons that have affirmatively expressed interest in receiving information or
entering into discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal and (iv) the
number of Persons that have executed an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.
The foregoing reports will not be required to include the identity of any of
the foregoing Persons. In addition, as of 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on
June 28, 2014, Protective will provide Dai-ichi with a written list
identifying each Person that, on or prior to such date, has executed an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and has not subsequently affirmatively
declined to receive information or enter into discussions regarding an
Acquisition Proposal. Protective will be required to provide information in
accordance with _Section 6.05(h)_ with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
received by Protective after the date of this Agreement whether prior to, on
or following the No Shop Period Start Date.

  

 (b) Except as otherwise permitted by this _Section 6.05_, from and after the No Shop Period Start Date, Protective and the Protective Subsidiaries will immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and Protective will cause its Representatives to terminate, any existing discussions or negotiations with any Person or its Representatives (other than Dai-ichi and Merger Sub and their Representatives) conducted prior to the No Shop Period Start Date with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (c) Except as otherwise permitted by this _Section 6.05_, from and after the No Shop Period Start Date, Protective and the Protective Subsidiaries will not, and Protective will cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiry or the making or announcement of any proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in or continue any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to any Person any information or data with respect to, or otherwise cooperate with or knowingly take any other action to facilitate any proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any Contract (including any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or agreement in principle) providing for an Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), (iv) take any action to make the provisions of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (including the approval of any Person becoming an "interested stockholder" pursuant to Section 203 of the DGCL), or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in Protective\'s Constituent Documents, inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal or (v) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding _Section 6.05(b)_ and _Section 6.05(c)_, at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, with respect to any Person that has executed an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement during the Solicitation and Early Signing Period, Protective, after the No Shop Period Start Date, may continue to furnish information and data to such Person or its Representatives pursuant to and in accordance with such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and continue to participate and engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or its Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal or any successor Acquisition Proposal, if and only if, and after such time as, such Person submits a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal and the Board of Directors of Protective determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal or successor Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding _Section 6.05(b)_ and _Section 6.05(c)_, at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, with respect to any Person that has submitted an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal on or after the No Shop Period Start Date that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.05_, Protective may furnish information and data to such Person or its Representatives pursuant to and in accordance with an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and participate and engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or its Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal, if and only if the Board of Directors of Protective has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel 

        

and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal. Any material non-public information provided by Protective
or any Protective Subsidiary to any Person entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement that has not been previously provided to Dai-ichi
must be provided to Dai-ichi concurrently with, or, if impractical, within 48
hours following, the time it is provided or made available to such Person.

  

 (e) Notwithstanding  _Section 6.03(b)_ but subject to _Section 6.05(f)_, at any time prior to the Stockholder Approval, if (i) an Intervening Event has occurred or (ii) Protective receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Protective has determined constitutes a Superior Proposal, then, in either case, the Board of Directors of Protective may effect a Change in Recommendation if and only if the Board of Directors of Protective has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors\' fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Protective under applicable Law. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding  _Section 6.05(e)_, the Board of Directors of Protective may not effect a Change in Recommendation unless (i) the Board of Directors of Protective has first provided written notice to Dai-ichi that it is prepared to effect a Change in Recommendation, which notice will, in the case of the occurrence of an Intervening Event, include a written description in reasonable detail of such Intervening Event, and in the case of a Superior Proposal, attach the most current unredacted version of the proposed agreement relating to such Superior Proposal (or if there is no proposed agreement, a description in reasonable detail of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal) and (ii) Dai-ichi does not make, within five Business Days after the receipt of such notice, a proposal that the Board of Directors of Protective determines in good faith (taking into account any revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Dai-ichi as provided in this _Section 6.05(f)_), after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, obviates the need for a Change in Recommendation. Protective agrees that, during such five Business Day period, Protective and its Representatives will negotiate in good faith with Dai-ichi and its Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Dai-ichi. If, following the execution by the Parties of an amendment to this Agreement providing for revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that obviate the need for a Change in Recommendation or the proposal by Dai-ichi of such revisions, there is a material change in the facts or circumstances relating to the Intervening Event or to the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal, in each case that gave rise to such Change in Recommendation, or Protective receives a Superior Proposal from another Person, then the provisions of this _Section 6.05(f)_ will be applicable with respect to a Change in Recommendation relating to such Intervening Event or amended or additional Superior Proposal. Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, Dai-ichi will be permitted to exercise its rights under this _Section 6.05(f)_ on not more than two occasions with respect to a Superior Proposal or a successor Superior Proposal made by any particular Person and Protective will have no obligation under clause (i) of this _Section 6.05(f)_ or otherwise to provide or deliver any subsequent notice that it is prepared to effect a Change in Recommendation with respect to any such Superior Proposal or of any changes to the pertinent Superior Proposal or to afford to Dai-ichi any further period to negotiate or propose changes. If the rights set forth in this _Section 6.05(f)_ have been exercised or are exercisable by Dai-ichi prior to the No Shop Period Start Date with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, the No Shop Period Start Date will be deemed extended until the second day following the day Dai-ichi is no longer entitled to exercise any rights with respect to pertinent Superior Proposal under this _Section 6.05(f)_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Protective may not enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement without effecting a Change in Recommendation and complying with the provisions of this _Section 6.05(f)_. 

       

                                    

  

 (g) Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation, the Board of Directors of Protective will continue to comply with its obligations under _Section 6.02_ and _Section 6.03_ and will submit this Agreement to the stockholders of Protective for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval unless this Agreement has been terminated prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, in accordance with _Article IX_. 

  

 (h) Except as set forth in _Section 6.05(f)_, as promptly as practicable after the receipt by Protective of any Acquisition Proposal, whether orally or in writing, and in any case within 48 hours after the receipt thereof by an executive officer of Protective, Protective will provide oral or written notice to Dai-ichi of such Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal. Protective (or its outside counsel) will, in person, by email or by telephone, keep Dai-ichi (or its outside counsel) reasonably informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours) with respect to any change to price or other material terms of such Acquisition Proposal. Protective will, promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof (and in any event within 48 hours), provide Dai-ichi (or its outside counsel) with copies of material documents comprising such Acquisition Proposal and any amendments thereto. 

   

 (i) Nothing contained in _Section 6.03(b)_ or this _Section 6.05_ will prohibit Protective from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that (i) any disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, a rejection of or recommendation against any applicable Acquisition Proposal or a reaffirmation of the Recommendation will be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and (ii) neither Protective or the Board of Directors of Protective may effect a Change in Recommendation except in accordance with _Section 6.05(f)_. 

  

 (j) Protective will promptly inform its and the Protective Subsidiaries\' respective Representatives of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.05_. Any breach or violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.05_ by any Representative of Protective or any Protective Subsidiary will be deemed to be a breach or violation of this _Section 6.05_ by Protective. 

   

 SECTION 6.06. _Release under Confidentiality Agreement; State Takeover Laws_. Protective hereby releases Dai-ichi and Merger Sub from the "standstill" provisions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. If any "fair price," "business combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Protective and its Board of Directors will use their reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and will otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 6.07. _Section 16 of the Exchange Act_. Prior to the Effective Time, Protective will take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Protective equity securities (including derivative securities with respect to Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 SECTION 6.08.  _Stockholder Litigation_. Protective will promptly advise Dai-ichi orally and in writing of any Proceeding brought by any stockholder of Protective against Protective or its directors or officers relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will keep Dai-ichi fully informed regarding any such litigation. Protective will give Dai-ichi the opportunity to participate in, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, but not control the defense of any such litigation, will give due consideration to Dai-ichi\'s advice with respect to such litigation and will not settle any such litigation without the prior written consent of Dai-ichi, such consent not to be unreasonably 

        

withheld, delayed or conditioned. Dai-ichi will promptly advise Protective
orally and in writing of any Proceeding brought by any stockholder of Dai-ichi
against Dai-ichi or its directors or officers relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will keep Protective fully
informed regarding any such litigation. Dai-ichi will give Protective the
opportunity to participate in, subject to a customary joint defense
agreement, but not control the defense of any such litigation, will give due
consideration to Protective\'s advice with respect to such litigation and
will not settle any such litigation without the prior written consent of
Protective if such settlement would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the Merger.

  

 SECTION 6.09. _Cooperation_. 

  

 (a) Protective will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with Dai-ichi and its Representatives and provide all financial and other information reasonably requested by Dai-ichi from time to time in order to permit Dai-ichi to comply with its obligations under applicable Law and the listing rules of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including with respect to Dai-ichi\'s arrangement of financing in connection with such transactions. Dai-ichi will, promptly upon request by Protective, reimburse Protective for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Protective or its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. All Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) regarding Protective and its Subsidiaries obtained by Dai-ichi or its Representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.09_ will be subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that, after giving reasonable advance written notice to Protective of such disclosure, Dai-ichi may disclose such information to Persons providing financing to Dai-ichi in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the Representatives of such Person who reasonably need to have access to such information) so long as such Persons and their Representatives acknowledge and agree to be bound by the confidentiality obligations set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement applicable to Representatives of Dai-ichi. 

  

 (b) The Parties and their legal counsel will cooperate in good faith to develop and implement appropriate procedures to facilitate compliance by Protective and the Protective Subsidiaries with the covenants sets forth in _Section 6.01(g)_ and _Section 6.01(h)_. Dai-ichi, upon the request of Protective from time to time, will consult and cooperate with Protective and its legal advisors in good faith to determine whether actions proposed to be taken by Protective or the Protective Subsidiaries may be taken in compliance with such covenants. 

   

 (c) Dai-ichi and Protective will discuss in good faith and cooperate with respect to matters which require reporting to Dai-ichi and with respect to the future governance model between Dai-ichi and Protective following the Closing for the purpose of compliance with the Laws (including any rules of any applicable securities exchange) applicable to Dai-ichi or for the purpose of compliance with Dai-ichi\'s internal consolidated accounting reporting requirement and other internal policies, or for the purposes of dealing with the applicable Governmental Authorities in Japan. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limitation thereto, Dai-ichi and Protective will establish a steering committee after the date of this Agreement for the purpose of discussing in advance of the Closing governance structure and other relevant arrangements following the Closing. 

   

 (d) In the event that Protective reasonably believes that actions taken by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners after the date of this Agreement may materially and adversely affect reserve financing structures that are already established by Protective or the Protective Subsidiaries or contemplated to be established by any of them in the future, then Protective and Dai-ichi will in good faith discuss possible ways in which Dai-ichi might mitigate the effect of any such actions by providing reserve financing or otherwise reasonably assisting Protective and the Protective Subsidiaries with their efforts to secure alternative financing.

Subject to applicable Laws and the requirements of any Governmental Authority, Protective and Dai-ichi will keep each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing each other with copies of notices or other communications received by Protective or Dai-ichi, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Authority with respect to the such transactions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 7.01_ will limit the right of a Party to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.01_, so long as such Party has until that time complied in all material respects with its obligations under this _Section 7.01_. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 7.01(e)_ or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to require Dai-ichi or Protective or any of their respective Subsidiaries to agree to or take any action that would result in any Burdensome Condition.

 SECTION 7.02. _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Dai-ichi and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) will honor all Benefit Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements of Protective and the Protective Subsidiaries in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Dai-ichi and its Subsidiaries will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide or cause to be provided to each employee of Protective and any Protective Subsidiary who remains in the employment of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, other than an employee who has entered into an employment continuation agreement with Protective (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") (i) at least the same level of base salary or wages (as applicable) and target cash incentive bonus opportunities and commission opportunities as were made available to such Continuing Employee by Protective and its Subsidiaries in effect immediately prior to the date hereof (or as the same may hereafter have been modified in compliance with the applicable provisions of Section 6.01) and (ii) employee benefits (other than equity or equity-based benefits and other than cash incentive bonus and commission opportunities) that are, in the aggregate, at least as favorable to those provided as of the date hereof to such Continuing Employee by Protective and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Benefit Plans. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Dai-ichi will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide to each Continuing Employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiary without cause during the one-year period following the Effective Time severance benefits at least equal to the severance benefits that would have been payable by Protective and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices but not in excess of one year (52 weeks) of base salary or wages, as applicable. 

  

 (b) Except to the extent necessary to avoid the duplication of benefits, the Surviving Corporation will recognize the service of each Continuing Employee with Protective or the Protective Subsidiaries before the Effective Time as if such service had been performed with Dai-ichi or its Affiliates (i) for all purposes under the Benefit Plans maintained by the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates after the Effective Time (to the extent such plans, programs or Contracts cover the Continuing Employee), (ii) for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any employee benefit plans and programs of the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates other than the Benefit Plans (the "Surviving Corporation Plans") in which the Continuing Employee participates after the Effective Time and (iii) for benefit accrual purposes under any Surviving Corporation Plan that is a vacation or severance plan in which the Continuing Employee participates after the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates will use their reasonable best efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees under the corresponding welfare plans maintained by Protective or its Affiliates prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid by such Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan. 

  

 (d) This Agreement is not intended by the Parties to (i) constitute an amendment to any Benefit Plan, employee benefit plan, fund or program, (ii) obligate Dai-ichi, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to maintain any particular compensation or benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement or (iii) create any obligation of the Parties with respect to any employee benefit plan of Dai-ichi, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates. Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any employee any benefits under any employee benefit plan, fund or program, including severance benefits or the right to employment or continued 

        

employment with Dai-ichi, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates for any period by reason of this Agreement.

  

 SECTION 7.03.  _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to _Section 9.03_, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be paid by the Party incurring such Expenses. 

  

 SECTION 7.04.  _Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Dai-ichi will cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) indemnify and hold harmless, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and employees of Protective and the Protective Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities) (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") (A) to the same extent such Indemnified Persons are indemnified or exculpated or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by Protective pursuant to Protective\'s Constituent Documents and indemnification Contracts, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement with the Indemnified Persons and (B) without limitation to clause (A), to the fullest extent permitted by Law, (ii) honor the provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of directors and officers and advancement of expenses contained in Protective\'s Constituent Documents immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) maintain for a period of six years after the Effective Time policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (" _D and O Insurance_") covering each person covered by Protective\'s current D and O Insurance as of the Effective Time, providing for at least the same coverage and amounts as, and containing terms and conditions which are no less favorable to the insured than, such current D and O Insurance, with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for any one coverage year more than 300 percent of the current annual premium expended by Protective and the Protective Subsidiaries to maintain or procure such D and O Insurance immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ "). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. In lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, Dai-ichi may cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase six-year prepaid "tail" insurance coverage, at a cost no greater than the six times the Maximum Annual Premium, that provides coverage not less favorable to the insured than the coverage described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Protective may in its sole discretion purchase, prior to the Effective Time, six-year prepaid "tail" insurance coverage, at a cost no greater than the six times the Maximum Annual Premium, that provides not less favorable to the insured than the coverage described above, and if Protective has obtained such prepaid "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, Dai-ichi will cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and Dai-ichi will have no further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance pursuant to this _Section 7.04(a)_. 

  

 (b) The rights of each Indemnified Person hereunder will be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the Constituent Documents of Protective or any of the Protective Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification Contract, the DGCL or otherwise. 

   

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 7.04_ will survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons and his or her heirs. In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or assigns consolidates 

        

with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
either such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation will assume and comply with the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.04_.

  

 (d) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 7.04_ will not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person without the consent of such Indemnified Person, it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Persons will be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.04_. Dai-ichi will honor, guaranty and stand as a surety for, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and successors to honor and comply with, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this _Section 7.04_ without limit as to time. Dai-ichi will pay all reasonable expenses that may be incurred by an Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 7.04_. 

  

 SECTION 7.05.  _Public Announcements_. Dai-ichi and Protective will develop a joint communications plan and each Party, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the date of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_, will (a) ensure that all press releases and other public statements or communications with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consistent with such joint communications plan and (b) unless otherwise required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to the rules of the NYSE, the Tokyo Stock Exchange or any other applicable securities exchange, consult with each other before issuing any press release or, to the extent practicable, otherwise making any public statement or communication with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the date of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_, except to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Proxy Statement in accordance with the provisions of _Section 6.02_, neither Dai-ichi nor Protective will issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or disclosure concerning the other Party or the other Party\'s business, financial condition or results of operations without the consent of the other Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. 

  

 SECTION 7.06.  _Notice of Certain Events_. Each of Dai-ichi and Protective will promptly notify the other after receiving or becoming aware of (a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or another Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from Dai-ichi or Protective, as the case may be) and (b) any Proceeding commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or otherwise involving Dai-ichi or any of the Dai-ichi Subsidiaries or Protective or any of the Protective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that relates to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 7.07.  _Control of Operations_. Without limiting any Party\'s rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement will give either Party, directly or indirectly, the right to control, direct or influence the other Party\'s operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time, each Party will exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations. 

   

 SECTION 7.08. _Certain Transfer Taxes_. Any liability arising out of any real estate transfer Tax with respect to interests in real property owned directly or indirectly by Protective or any the Protective Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Merger, if applicable and due with respect to the Merger, will be borne by the Surviving Corporation and expressly will not be a liability of stockholders of Dai-ichi or Protective.

 (a) Protective will pay to Dai-ichi, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amounts set forth in this _Section 9.03(a)_ if this Agreement is terminated under the following circumstances (it being understood and agreed that in no event will Protective be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion): 

  

  

 (i) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.01(c)(ii)_ or _Section 9.01(c)(iii)_, then Protective will pay the Termination Fee by the second Business Day following the date of such termination (it being understood that Protective\'s failure to reaffirm under such circumstances will not be deemed an intentional and material breach of this Agreement); 

  

 (ii) if this Agreement is terminated (A) by either Party pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)(i)_ without a vote of the stockholders of Protective contemplated by this Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting having occurred and, on the End Date, all of the conditions precedent to the Closing (other than the condition precedent set forth in _Section 8.01(a))_ have been satisfied (or in the case of conditions precedent that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, are capable of being satisfied on the End Date) or (B) pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)(iii)_ and, in any such case, an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or has otherwise become publicly known, or any Person has publicly announced or communicated an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal, at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time of the taking of the vote of the stockholders of Protective at the Stockholders Meeting (or prior to the termination of this Agreement if there has been no Stockholders Meeting), and at such time such Acquisition Proposal or such intent has not been publicly withdrawn or repudiated by such Person, then 

    

 (A) Protective will pay the Expense Reimbursement to Dai-ichi by wire transfer of immediately available funds within three Business Days after delivery by Dai-ichi to Protective of a written statement setting forth the amount thereof and attaching applicable documentation; and 

  

 (B) if, within 12 months after the date of such termination, Protective either consummates a transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal (including any Acquisition Proposal made after the date of the termination of this Agreement), or enters into a definitive agreement to consummate a transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal and Protective thereafter consummates such Acquisition Proposal (whether or not within such 12-month period), then Protective will pay the Termination Fee by the third Business Day following the date Protective consummates such transaction; _provided_ that, for purposes of this _Section 9.03(a)(ii)(B)_, all references to 15 percent including in the definition of the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " will be changed to 50 percent; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the amount of any Expense Reimbursement paid to Dai-ichi pursuant to the foregoing clause (A) will be credited against and will reduce the Termination Fee payable pursuant to this _Section 9.03(a)(ii)(B)_; or 

    

 (iii) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(ii)_, then Protective will pay the Termination Fee on the date, and as a condition to the effectiveness, of such termination. 

  

      

                                    

  

 (b) Protective acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this _Section 9.03_ are an integral part of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Dai-ichi would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Protective fails promptly to pay any amounts due under this _Section 9.03_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Dai-ichi commences any Proceeding that results in a judgment against Protective for such amounts, Protective will pay interest on such amounts from the date payment of such amounts was due to the date of actual payment at the prime rate of the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation in effect on the date such payment was due, together with the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Dai-ichi in connection with such Proceeding.

 SECTION 10.03.  _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits, Schedules and the Parties\' disclosure letters) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to their subject matter. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any Person not a party to this Agreement any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever, other than (a) _Section 7.04_, which is intended to be for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons and their heirs and assigns covered thereby and may be enforced by such Indemnified Persons and their heirs and assigns and (b) _Article II_, which is intended to be for the benefit of holders of shares of Common Stock and Equity Rights with respect to the right of such holders to receive, as applicable, the Merger Consideration and the consideration set forth in _Section 2.07_. Dai-ichi\'s obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate as of the Closing. 

  

 SECTION 10.04. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

  

 SECTION 10.05.  _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the Parties, in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent will be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this 

        

Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  

 SECTION 10.06.  _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of Protective, but after such approval, no amendment will be made which by Law or in accordance with the rules of the NYSE requires further approval by such stockholders without such further approval. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no amendment will be made to this Agreement after the Effective Time. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties. 

  

 SECTION 10.07.  _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may to the extent legally permitted (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. No extension or waiver will be made which by Law or in accordance with the rules of the NYSE requires further approval by the stockholders of Protective without such further approval. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of those rights. 

  

 SECTION 10.08.  _Governing Law and Venue: Waiver of Jury Trial_. 

  

 (a) THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS WILL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS RULES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. The Parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware with respect to all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement, and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties agree that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding will be heard and determined exclusively in such a Delaware state or federal court. The Parties consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such Parties solely for such purpose and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 10.02_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law will be valid and sufficient service. Without limiting the foregoing, Dai-ichi irrevocably appoints The Corporation Trust Company, Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801 as its agent for service of process for purposes of any Proceeding in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (b) EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, 

        

THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER. EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER. EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND
EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS IN THIS _Section 10.08(b)_.

  

 SECTION 10.09.  _Enforcement_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any court referred to in _Section 10.08_, without proof of actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for such breach. 

   

 SECTION 10.10. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement will become effective when each Party has received counterparts signed and delivered (by facsimile, electronic mail or otherwise) by the other Parties.
