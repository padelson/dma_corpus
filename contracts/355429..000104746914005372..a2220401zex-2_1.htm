otherwise specified. Time periods within or following which any payment is to be made or act is to be done will, unless expressly indicated otherwise, be calculated by excluding the day on which the
period commences and including the day on which the period ends and by extending the period to the next Business Day following if the last day of the period is not a Business Day. The words "hereof,"

any particular provision of this Agreement, and all Article, Section, Exhibit and Schedule references are to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. Where this Agreement states that a Party
"shall," "will" or "must" perform in some manner or otherwise act or omit to act, it means that the Party is legally obligated to do so in accordance with this Agreement. Any reference to a statute,
rule or regulation is deemed also to refer to any amendments or successor legislation as in effect at the relevant time. Any reference to a Contract or other document as of a given date means the
Contract or other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time through such date. The table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The Protective Disclosure Letter and the Dai-ichi
Disclosure Letter, as well as all other schedules and exhibits hereto, will be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement. Whenever this Agreement provides that
documents or information have been "made available" to Dai-ichi, Merger Sub or their Representatives, such documents or information will be deemed to have been so made available if (a)&nbsp;at least
two Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement, they were filed as exhibits to the SEC Documents and publicly available on the internet website of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the

Protective, each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect, except, in each case, as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting

such Golden Gate Contract (including all modifications and amendments thereto and any material waivers by Protective or the applicable Protective Subsidiary thereunder). To the Knowledge of
Protective, (i)&nbsp;no counterparty under any such Golden Gate Contract is insolvent or the subject of a rehabilitation, liquidation, conservatorship, receivership, bankruptcy or similar proceeding

prepaid "tail" insurance coverage, at a cost no greater than the six times the Maximum Annual Premium, that provides not less favorable to the insured than the coverage described above, and if
Protective has obtained such prepaid "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, Dai-ichi will cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations

their subject matter. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any
Person not a party to this Agreement any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever, other than (a)&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;7.04</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, which is
intended to be for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons and their heirs and assigns covered thereby and may be enforced by such Indemnified Persons and their heirs and assigns and

the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate as of the Closing. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION&nbsp;10.04. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Severability</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by
any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in
order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. </FONT></P>

the United States of America located in the State of Delaware with respect to all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement, and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit
or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in
such courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties agree that all claims with respect to
such action or proceeding will be heard and determined exclusively in such a Delaware state or federal court. The Parties consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such
Parties solely for such purpose and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in </FONT> <FONT

of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is
accordingly agreed that the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof in any court referred to in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;10.08</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, without proof of actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing

of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for such breach. </FONT></P>
