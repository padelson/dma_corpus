ARTICLE II 
 The Offer 

   

 Section 2.01 The Offer 

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated pursuant to Article XI and nothing shall have occurred that, had the Offer been commenced, would give rise to a right to terminate the Offer pursuant to any of the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of Annex I, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof (or such later date as the parties may mutually agree in writing), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the 1934 Act) the Offer to purchase any and all of the outstanding Shares at the Offer Price, less any withholding Taxes. Merger Subs obligation to accept for payment and pay for any Shares tendered in the Offer shall be subject to the condition that there shall be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer, 

    ##### 

  

 

immediately prior to the expiration date of the Offer and not withdrawn, a
number of Shares that, together with the Shares then owned by Parent and/or
Merger Sub, represents at least a majority of the total number of Shares
outstanding on a fully diluted basis (assuming conversion or exercise of all
derivative securities or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock
regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or
other terms and conditions thereof) (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") and to the
other conditions set forth in Annex I. Merger Sub expressly reserves the
right to waive any of the conditions to the Offer and to make any change in
the terms of or conditions to the Offer; provided that, without the prior
consent of the Company, (i) the Minimum Condition may not be waived or amended
and (ii) no change may be made that changes the form of consideration to be
paid pursuant to the Offer, decreases the Offer Price or the number of Shares
sought in the Offer, imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set
forth in Annex I or modifies the conditions set forth in Annex I in any
manner materially adverse to the holders of Shares. The initial expiration
date of the Offer shall be the twentieth (20th) Business Day after
commencement of the Offer (determined in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
under the 1934 Act) (such date, or such subsequent date to which the
expiration of the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (x) without the consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall have the
right to extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to
the Offer or any period required by Applicable Law and (y) if any condition
to the Offer is not satisfied or waived on any scheduled Expiration Date of
the Offer, Merger Sub shall, subject to the rights of the parties in Article
XI, extend the Offer for one or more periods (each in the reasonable judgment
of Merger Sub for the minimum period of time reasonably expected by the
Merger Sub to be required to satisfy such conditions but in any event not in
excess of twenty (20) Business Days each) until such conditions are satisfied
or waived; _provided_ , in each case, (A) if, at the initial Expiration Date
all of the conditions to the Offer, except for the Minimum Condition, are
satisfied or have been waived, Merger Sub shall only be required to extend the
Offer and its expiration date beyond the initial Expiration Date for one or
more additional periods not to exceed an aggregate of twenty (20) Business
Days, and (B) in no event shall Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer
beyond the End Date. Following expiration of the Offer, Merger Sub may, in
its sole discretion, provide a subsequent offering period (" _Subsequent
Offering Period_ ") in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the 1934 Act. Merger
Sub shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer prior to its Expiration Date,
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article XI hereof. If
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article XI, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly terminate the Offer and shall not
acquire Shares pursuant thereto. If the Offer is terminated by Merger Sub, or
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article XI prior to the acquisition
of Shares in the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any
depositary acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, in accordance
with Applicable Law, all tendered Shares that have not then been purchased in
the Offer to the registered holders thereof. Subject to the foregoing,
including the requirements of Rule 14d-11, and upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of the Offer, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause it to,
accept for payment and pay for, as promptly as practicable after the
expiration of the Offer, all Shares (i) validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer and (ii) validly tendered in the Subsequent Offering
Period (the time at which Shares are first accepted for payment under the
Offer, the " _Acceptance Time_ "). 

   

 (b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") that shall include the summary term sheet required thereby and, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of 

    ##### 

  

 

letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other appropriate
ancillary Offer documents (collectively, together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Company shall promptly
upon request of Parent and Merger Sub provide Parent with all information
concerning the Company that may be required by applicable securities laws or
reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Schedule TO
or the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees
promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule TO
or the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become (or shall become known to be) false or misleading in any material
respect. Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each
case, as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities
laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to

before any such document is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made
by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the
Company and its counsel with (i) any comments or other communications,
whether written or oral, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive

or Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those comments or other
communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
response of Parent and Merger Sub to those comments and to provide comments
on that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall
be given). 

   

 (c) Nothing in this Section 2.01 shall affect any termination rights in Article XI.

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) On the day that the Offer is commenced, the Company shall file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that, subject to Section 7.03(b), shall reflect the recommendations of the Board of Directors referred to above. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case, as soon as reasonably practicable and as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws.

 Section 2.03 Directors 

  

 (a) Effective upon the Acceptance Time and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, to serve on the Board of Directors of the Company, that equals the product of, (i) the total number of directors on the Board of Directors of the Company (giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section) and (ii) the percentage that the number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger Sub (including Shares accepted for payment in the Offer and any Top-Up Shares) bears to the total number of Shares outstanding. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause Parents designees to be seated or appointed to the Companys Board of Directors, including by increasing the number of directors and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors (with such method to be by the election of Parent, including the selection of the individuals designated after resignation). At such time, the Company shall also cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (A) each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and (B) as requested by Parent, each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on the Board of Directors of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Acceptance Time, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company and such committees and boards as of the date hereof who are not employees of the Company shall remain members of the Board of Directors of the Company and such committees and boards until the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to 

    ##### 

  

 

fulfill its obligations under this Section. Parent shall supply to the Company
in writing and be solely responsible for any information with respect to
itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 and the Companys obligations under
Section 2.03(b) shall be subject to the receipt of such information. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to Section 2.03(a) and until the Effective Time, at least three (3) of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company shall be directors of the Company who were directors of the Company on the date hereof and are "independent directors" of the Company for purposes of NASDAQ Rule 5605 as in effect on the date hereof (the " _Continuing Directors_ ") and such directors shall constitute a committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, provided that if there shall be in office fewer than three (3) Continuing Directors for any reason, the committee of Continuing Directors shall fill such vacancy, and such person shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement, or if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors then in office shall designate three (3) persons who are not directors, officers, employees, or Affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub and who are "independent directors" of the Company for purposes of NASDAQ Rule 5605 as in effect on the date hereof, and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. So long as there shall be at least one (1) member of the Continuing Director committee, the approval of a majority of the members of the committee of Continuing Directors (or the sole member of such committee if there shall be only one (1) Continuing Director) shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Board of Directors of the Company and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize except to the extent otherwise provided by Applicable Law) any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement requiring action by the Board of Directors of the Company, any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company and any exercise of the Companys rights or remedies under this Agreement. 

   

 (d) The parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to Section 2.03(a) and until the Effective Time, each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company that is required by NASDAQ or the federal securities laws to be comprised solely of, or a majority of, Continuing Directors shall be so comprised; provided, however, that in such event, if the number of Continuing Directors shall be reduced below the number of directors as may be required by such rules or securities laws for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Continuing Director(s) shall be entitled to designate persons meeting the foregoing criteria to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no other Continuing Director then remains, the other directors then in office shall designate such number of directors as may be required by the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ and the federal securities laws persons to fill such vacancies who are not directors, officers, employees, or Affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub as may be required by the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ and the federal securities laws, and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. 

     ##### 

  

     

 Section 2.04 Top-Up Option 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 2.04(b) and Section 2.04(c), the Company grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option, for so long as this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to Article XI (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), to purchase from the Company up to the number of authorized and unissued Shares equal to the number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one Share more than 90% of the number of shares of each class of the Company capital stock then outstanding that, absent Section 253 of Delaware Law, would be entitled to vote on the Merger (the " _Requisite Short-Form Merger Shares_") after the issuance of all Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, calculated on a fully diluted basis (assuming conversion or exercise of all derivative securities or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other terms and conditions thereof) or, as may be elected by Parent, on a primary basis at the Effective Time (such Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the " _Top-Up Shares_ "). 

   

 (b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub, from time to time in whole or in part, at any time following the Acceptance Time, or if any Subsequent Offering Period is provided, following the Expiration Date of the Subsequent Offering Period and only if Merger Sub shall own as of such time less than the Requisite Short-Form Merger Shares; provided that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable to the extent (i) the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the number of authorized but unissued Shares or (ii) any provision of Applicable Law (including, without limitation, applicable rules and regulations of NASDAQ) shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares. The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Shares being purchased by Merger Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such Shares by the Offer Price, without interest. Such purchase price may be paid by Merger Sub, at its election, either entirely in cash or by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to such purchase price. Any such promissory note shall be full recourse against Parent and Merger Sub and bear interest at the rate of 3% per annum and may be prepaid without premium or penalty. 

   

 (c) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable legal requirements of all Governmental Authorities, including the availability of an applicable exemption from registration of the issuance of the Top-Up Shares under the 1933 Act. 

   

 (d) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company a notice (the " _Top-Up Notice_ ") setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up Shares that Merger Sub intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which Merger Sub intends to pay the applicable purchase price and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of such Top-Up Shares by Merger Sub is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares or if the Company does not then have certificated Shares, the applicable number of book-entry Shares. The parties hereto agree to use their 

    ##### 

  

 

reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Shares to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice is deemed received by
the Company pursuant to Section 12.01, and if not so consummated on such day,
as promptly thereafter as possible. The parties further agree to use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated in accordance
with Section 253 of Delaware Law and as contemplated by Section 9.06 as close
in time as possible to (including, to the extent possible, on the same day
as) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares. 

   

 (e) Parent and Merger Sub understand that the Top-Up Shares will not be registered under the 1933 Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each of Parent and Merger Sub represents, warrants and agrees that the Top-Up Option is being, and the Top-Up Shares will be, acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the 1933 Act. Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares shall include any legends required by applicable securities laws. 

   

 (f) Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with each other in doing, all things necessary or desirable to procure from NASDAQ or any other Governmental Authority any necessary waiver or other exemption from the requirements of NASDAQ Rule 5635 or other Applicable Law in order to enable the issuance of the Top-Up Shares to occur without the need to obtain the approval of holders of a majority of the Shares present and voting at a meeting of the Companys stockholders.

As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and (i) each certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and (ii) each uncertificated share of Company Common Stock (an " _Uncertificated Share_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time was registered to a holder on the stock transfer books of the Company, shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company or owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and 

   

 (c) each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 Section 4.02 Equity Awards 

  

 (a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares under any employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be canceled, and the Company shall pay each holder of any such option at or promptly after the Effective Time for each such Company Stock Option surrendered an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such option by (ii) the number of Shares such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of all Company Stock Options) had such holder exercised such Company Stock Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Restricted Share shall vest and become free of such other lapsing restrictions as of the Effective Time and shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 4.01(a). 

   

 (c) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding stock appreciation right entitling the holder thereof the right to receive Shares (or a cash payment determined 

    ##### 

  

 

in relation to the value thereof) upon exercise issued pursuant to any
employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company
(each, a " _Company Stock Appreciation Right_ "), whether or not exercisable
or vested, shall be canceled, and the Company shall pay each holder of any
such right at or promptly after the Effective Time for each such Company
Stock Appreciation Right surrendered an amount in cash determined by
multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price of such right by (ii) the number of Shares
subject to such Company Stock Appreciation Right (assuming full vesting of
all Company Stock Appreciation Rights). 

   

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain any consents from holders of Company Stock Options and Company Stock Appreciation Rights and make any amendments to the terms of such equity or compensation plans or arrangements that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 4.02. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, payment may be withheld in respect of any Company Stock Option or Company Stock Appreciation Rights until such necessary consents are obtained. 

   

 Section 4.03 Surrender of Shares of Company Common Stock and Payment 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates or Uncertificated Shares for the Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time, for exchange in accordance with this Section 4.03(a) through the Exchange Agent, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 4.01(a). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. 

   

 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly 

    ##### 

  

 

transferred and (ii) the person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   

 (d) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration to the extent provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article IV. 

   

 (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 4.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or otherwise on the instruction of Parent, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 4.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto, in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

   

 Section 4.04 Adjustments 

  

 If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur, as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split), merger, combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, subdivision or other similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the effect of such event on the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration or any such other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 4.05 Dissenting Shares 

  

 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held of record by stockholders who are entitled to demand and have properly demanded appraisal for such shares of Company 

   ##### 

  

    

Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law (such shares,
the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as set forth in Section 4.01, but the holders of
such Dissenting Shares instead shall be entitled to, and the Dissenting
Shares shall only represent the right to receive, payment of the fair value
of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
Delaware Law; provided, however, that (a) if such holder fails to demand
properly in writing from the Surviving Corporation the appraisal of such
holders Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262(d) of Delaware Law
or, after making such demand, subsequently delivers an effective
written withdrawal of such demand, or fails to establish such holders
entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in Section 262 of Delaware Law,
if so required, or (b) if the applicable court shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to appraisal rights or such holder shall otherwise
lose such holders appraisal rights, then, in any such case, each share of
Company Common Stock held of record by such holder or holders shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares
of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to direct all
communications, negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make
any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such
demands. 

  

 Section 4.06 Withholding Rights 

  

 Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any person pursuant to Article III and Article IV such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of any Applicable Law, including federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Share and Company Stock Appreciation Right in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

  

 Section 4.07 Lost Certificates 

  

 If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article IV.

Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from complying with requirements of Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, so long as any action taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with this Section 7.03; provided, that such requirement will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such requirement would otherwise have under this Agreement.

The Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (including any changes thereto) and shall promptly (but in no

event later than forty-eight (48) hours after receipt) provide to Parent

Company or any of its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or conditions of
any Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding the terms of Section 7.03(a), at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Board of Directors of the Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a material development or a material change in circumstances that relates to the value of the Company (other than an Acquisition Proposal) that was not known to the Board of Directors of the Company nor reasonably foreseeable by the Board of Directors of the Company as of or prior to the date of this Agreement (and not relating in any way to any Acquisition Proposal), if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by a majority vote, after considering advice from outside legal counsel to the Company, that it must take such action to comply with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, (ii) the Company has notified Parent in writing, at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of such Adverse Recommendation Change, that it is considering taking such action and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefore and facts underlying such determination, and (iii) during such forty-eight (48) hour period, the Company, at the request of Parent, has engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for such Adverse Recommendation Change.

 The representations, warranties and agreements contained herein and in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time, except for the agreements set forth in Section 8.04 and Section 8.05. 

  

 Section 12.03 Amendments and Waivers 

  

 (a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided that, after the Company Stockholder Approval there shall be no amendment or waiver that pursuant to Delaware Law requires further Company Stockholder Approval without their further approval. 

   

 (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any 

     ##### 

  

    

other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law. 

   

 Section 12.04 Expenses 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense; provided however, Parent shall bear the filing fees for the Notification and Report Forms filed with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division under the HSR Act and any premerger notification and reports filed under similar applicable antitrust law of any non United States governmental antitrust authority. 

   

 (b) If a Company Payment Event occurs, the Company shall pay Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds), if, pursuant to clause (x) of the definition of Company Payment Event, simultaneously with the occurrence of such Company Payment Event or, if pursuant to clause (y) of the definition of Company Payment Event, within two (2) Business Days following such Company Payment Event, a fee equal to Thirty-Six Million Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($36,300,000.00) (the " _Company Termination Fee_ "). 

   

 (c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 12.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Each of the parties further acknowledges and agrees that the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather liquidated damages in amounts reasonably estimated by Parent and Merger Sub to compensate the other for efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectations of the consummation of the Offer and the Merger. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 12.04, it shall also pay any reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment against the Company for such amount, together with interest on any amount due at a rate per annum equal to three percent (3%) over the prime rate (as published in The Wall Street Journal) in effect on the date such payment should have been made. 

   

 (d) The prevailing party in any legal action undertaken to enforce this Agreement or any provision hereof will be entitled to recover from the other party the reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys and expert witness fees) incurred in connection with such action in addition to any other relief to which such party may be entitled under the terms hereof. 

   

 Section 12.05 Disclosure Schedule References 

  

 The parties hereto agree that disclosure of any item, matter or event in a particular Section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as 

   ##### 

  

 

applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are
contained in the corresponding section or subsection, as applicable, of this
Agreement and (ii) any other representation and warranty of such party that
is contained in another section or subsection of this Agreement, to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is relevant to
such other Section or subsection. 

   

 Section 12.06 Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment 

  

 (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Section 8.04 and this Section 12.06, shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 8.04 and this Section 12.06, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Sections 12.08(b) and 12.09 shall be enforceable by each Financing Source and its successors and assigns. 

   

 (b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party hereto, except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the Effective Time, to any person; provided that such transfer or assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or Merger Sub.

   ##### 

  

 

been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in
Section 12.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication).
