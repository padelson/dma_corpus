Company Common Stock regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other

Offer and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer; provided that, without the
prior consent of the Company, (i)&nbsp;the Minimum Condition may not be waived or amended and (ii)&nbsp;no

unissued Shares equal to the number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by
Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one Share more than 90% of the number of shares of
each class of the Company capital stock then outstanding that, absent Section&nbsp;253 of Delaware Law,
would be entitled to vote on the Merger (the &#147;<U>Requisite Short-Form&nbsp;Merger Shares</U>&#148;) after

anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable to the

Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares. The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up

multiplying the number of such Shares by the Offer Price, without interest. Such purchase price
may be paid by Merger Sub, at its election, either entirely in cash or by executing and delivering

this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense; provided however, Parent
shall bear the filing fees for the Notification and Report Forms filed with the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division under the HSR Act and any premerger notification and reports
filed under similar applicable antitrust law of any non United States governmental antitrust
authority.

(y)&nbsp;of the definition of Company Payment Event, within two (2)&nbsp;Business Days following such Company
Payment Event, a fee equal to Thirty-Six Million Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($36,300,000.00)

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section&nbsp;12.04 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Each of the parties further
acknowledges and agrees that the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather liquidated
damages in amounts reasonably estimated by Parent and Merger Sub to compensate the other for
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectations of the consummation of the Offer and the Merger.
Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section&nbsp;12.04,
it shall also pay any reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) incurred by Parent
and Merger Sub in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a
judgment against the Company for such amount, together with interest on any amount due at a rate
per annum equal to three percent (3%) over the prime rate (as published in The Wall Street Journal)

in addition to any other relief to which such party may be entitled under the terms hereof.
