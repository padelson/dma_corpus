 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent, the Company (the
"Company Board") and Merger Sub have approved and declared advisable and in
the best interests of their respective stockholders, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the merger of Merger
Sub with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions and limitations set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL");

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company Board has, subject to _Section 5.5(d)_ and _5.5(e)_ ,
resolved to recommend that the Company's stockholders approve the adoption of
this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as an inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, each
of Parent and certain stockholders of the Company have entered into a voting
and support agreement in the form attached as  _Exhibit A_ hereto (the
"Voting and Support Agreement"), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms
and limitations thereof, among other things, the foregoing stockholders
agreed to vote the shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by each
of them in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby at the Company Stockholders'
Meeting; and

  



  

WHEREAS, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with
the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

Day after the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_  (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of such conditions),
unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto (such date being the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall take

become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed
with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later date and time as is

Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being hereinafter referred to
as the "Effective Time").

directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from

ARTICLE II 
  
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  



  

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

  



  

(a) _Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holders of any Securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

  



  

(i) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Canceled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, $4.28 per share in
cash, without interest (the "Common Stock Consideration").

  



  

(ii) _Company Preferred Stock_. Each share of (A) Company Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B)
Series A-1 Preferred Stock that has accrued and accumulated on a daily basis
until the Effective Time, in accordance with the provisions of the Company
Certificate of Designation, but which is not otherwise issued or
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case other than
Canceled Shares and Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to
receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, an amount in cash
equal to $85.60 per share, without interest (the "Preferred Stock
Consideration").

  



  

(iii) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of Company
Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent (including Merger Sub) immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or
payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof (such
shares, "Canceled Shares").

  



  

(iv) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one (1) fully paid share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Certificates; Book Entry Shares_. Each share of Company Stock
to be converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration
as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
certificates (the "Certificates") or book-entry shares ("Book-Entry Shares"),
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Stock,
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Stock other than
the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_ , the applicable Merger
Consideration.

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

(c) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number or type of
outstanding shares of Company Stock shall occur as a result of a
reclassification, recapitalization, exchange, stock split (including a reverse
stock split) or combination or readjustment of shares or any similar event or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, the applicable Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent
amounts and items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event. Nothing in this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any
other provision of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Surrender of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Funds_. Prior to the
Closing, Parent shall, at its sole cost and expense, enter into a customary
paying agent agreement with a nationally recognized financial institution
designated by Parent that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Paying Agent") for the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 2.1(a)(i)_ and _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying
Agent, for payment in accordance with this _Article II_ through the Paying
Agent, cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay (i)
the Aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the shares of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Canceled Shares or Dissenting Shares) and (ii) the Warrant Consideration (the
"Payment Fund"). The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent if and
as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation pending payment thereof by
the Paying Agent to the holders of the shares of Company Stock,  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to the holders of the shares of Company Stock pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)_ and to the extent of any such loss, Parent shall promptly fund
additional cash amounts to the Paying Agent sufficient to enable payment of
such amounts. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings
shall accrue to the benefit of holders of shares of Company Stock.

  



  

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
(and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time),
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
2.5_ ) to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in the form and have such
other customary provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions (which instructions shall be in the form and have such other
customary provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for cash in an amount equal to
the applicable Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of
Company Stock previously represented by such Certificates.

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in _Section 2.5_ ) for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly
as reasonably practicable cash in an amount equal to the applicable Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock previously
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.5_ ) so surrendered shall be forthwith
cancelled. Each Book-Entry Share shall automatically upon the Effective Time
be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and
deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, cash in an amount equal to the applicable Merger Consideration
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock previously represented by
such Book-Entry Share. Until surrendered, in the case of a Certificate, or
paid, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, in each case, as contemplated by
this _Section 2.2(c)_ , each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed,
from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(c)_. The
Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in _Section 2.5_ ) and make such payments and deliveries
with respect to Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on the cash amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 2.2(c)_.

  



  

(d) _Unregistered Transfers_. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Stock, as applicable, that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment of the appropriate amount of the
applicable Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer (and accompanied by all documents
reasonably required by the Paying Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be
properly transferred and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

  



  

(e) _Termination of Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund made
available to the Paying Agent, which remains undistributed to the holders of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares six (6) months after the Effective Time,
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or its designee upon demand,
and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied
with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation as general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for
the applicable Merger Consideration.

  



  

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any applicable
Merger Consideration delivered to a Governmental Authority pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered or Book-Entry Share not paid, in each case, in
accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_ , immediately prior to the date on which any
Common Stock Consideration or Preferred Stock Consideration in respect of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority under applicable Law, any such Common
Stock Consideration or Preferred Stock Consideration in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(g) _Withholding_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
any of their applicable Subsidiaries and the Paying Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the applicable Merger Consideration and any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any of their applicable
Subsidiaries or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so withheld and paid over to an applicable
Governmental Authority as required by applicable Law shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, any of their applicable Subsidiaries or the Paying
Agent.

  



  

Section 2.3 _Company Warrants_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub
shall assume any Company Warrant or substitute for any Company Warrant any
similar warrant for Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. At the Effective
Time, each Company Warrant that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior thereto shall by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on
the part of any holder of any Company Warrant be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive from the Company at the Effective Time a cash payment
(without interest) equal to (i) the product of (A) the excess, if any, of (1)
the Common Stock Consideration over (2) the per share exercise price of such
Company Warrant, and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Warrant as of the Effective Time (the "Warrant
Consideration"), less (ii) any applicable withholding Taxes required by
applicable Law to be withheld. As of the Effective Time, all Company Warrants
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and
each holder of a Company Warrant shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Warrant Consideration. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price payable in respect of a share of
Company Common Stock underlying a Company Warrant equals or exceeds the Common
Stock Consideration, such Company Warrant shall be cancelled for no
consideration immediately prior to the Effective Time and the holder thereof
shall have no further rights with respect thereto.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Company Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub
shall assume any Company Option or substitute for any Company Option any
similar award for Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger and any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. At the Effective Time,
each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior thereto, whether vested or unvested, shall by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Option be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the Company at the
Effective Time a cash payment (without interest) equal to (i) the product of
(A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Common Stock Consideration over (2) the per
share exercise price of such Company Option, and (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of the Effective Time
(the "Option Consideration"), less (ii) any applicable withholding Taxes
required by applicable Law to be withheld. As of the Effective Time, all
Company Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease
to exist, and each holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Consideration.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price payable in respect of a
share of Company Common Stock underlying a Company Option equals or exceeds
the Common Stock Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled for no
consideration immediately prior to the Effective Time and the holder thereof
shall have no further rights with respect thereto.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(b) _Treatment of Company RSU Awards_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub
shall assume any Company RSU Award or substitute for any Company RSU Award
any similar award for Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the Effective
Time, each Company RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of any Company RSU Award be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the Company at the
Effective Time a cash payment (without interest) equal to (i) the product of

Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award as of the Effective Time (the
"RSU Consideration"), less (ii) any applicable withholding Taxes required by

the contrary contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any
Company RSU Award which immediately prior to such cancellation is

the applicable settlement date(s) for such Company RSU Award if required in
order to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

(d) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall provide such notice, if any, to the extent required under the terms of
any of the Company Equity Plans, Company Warrants or Company Preferred Stock,
as applicable, obtain any necessary consents or waivers, adopt applicable
resolutions, amend the terms of any of the Company Equity Plans (or any
outstanding awards thereunder), Company Warrants or Company Preferred Stock,
as applicable, including obtaining an executed letter, substantially in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ ("Preferred Stockholder Letter"), from
each holder of Company Preferred Stock, and take all other appropriate
actions to (i) give effect to the transactions contemplated herein; (ii)
terminate each of the Company Equity Plans as of the Effective Time; and
(iii) ensure that after the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Equity
Award, any beneficiary thereof nor any other participant in any of the Company
Equity Plans and no holder of a Company Warrant or Company Preferred Stock or
any beneficiary thereof shall have any right thereunder to acquire any
Securities of the Company or to receive any payment or benefit with respect
to (x) any award previously granted under any of the Company Equity Plans
or (y) any Company Warrant or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, except
as provided in _Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.4_. The Company shall provide
Parent with documentation evidencing the completion of the foregoing actions
(the form and substance of such documentation shall be subject to review and
approval by Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) no later than the Business Day preceding the
Effective Time.

Section 2.5 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent or Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable and customary amount as the Paying Agent or Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this
_Article II_.

  



  

Section 2.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that holders of Company Stock
are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, any shares of
Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected his, her or its
demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and not effectively
withdrawn or lost such holder's rights to appraisal (the "Dissenting
Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares
shall instead be entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (it being understood and acknowledged
that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and
such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the
right to receive the consideration therefor as may be determined in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
such holder shall have failed to timely perfect or shall have waived,
effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL (whether occurring before, at or after the Effective
Time), or a court of competent jurisdiction shall have determined that such
holder is not entitled to such right to appraisal and payment under Section
262 of the DGCL, such holder's shares of Company Stock shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the applicable Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon,
and such shares shall no longer be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of
any shares of Company Stock, effective or attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the
Company relating to appraisal demands, and Parent shall have the opportunity
and right to participate in all discussions, negotiations and Proceedings,
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to
be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld), voluntarily make any
payment with respect to or settle or compromise or offer to settle or
compromise any such demand or Proceeding, or agree in writing to do any of the
foregoing.

Section 2.7 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer following the Effective Time, they
shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration, as
provided for in _Section 2.1(a)_ , for each share of Company Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates or Book Entry Shares.

  



  

Section 2.8 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation or Parent with full right, title and possession of
and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company with respect to
the Merger, the officers and directors of Parent shall be fully
authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
and otherwise) to take such action.

 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  



  

Except (a) as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter referenced therein

Letter to which its applicability is reasonably apparent) or (b) other than

Company SEC Documents filed with (or furnished to) the SEC by the Company on
or after December 31, 2018 and at least two (2) Business Days prior to the

Looking Statements" or safe harbor or in any "forward-looking statements"
legend or any similar non-specific, predictive, precautionary or forward-
looking statements) and to the extent publicly available on the SEC's
Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System, the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  



  

Section 3.1 _Organization; Qualification_.

manner in which its properties and assets are currently operated and (ii) duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the character or location of the property owned, leased
or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company's Certificate of Incorporation (the
"Certificate of Incorporation") and Bylaws (the "Bylaws"), each as amended as
of the date of this Agreement, have been made available to Parent and are in
full force and effect, and the Company is not in violation of any of the

the manner in which its properties and assets are currently operated and (ii)

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Except as has not had, and would not reasonably be

Adverse Effect, the organizational or governing documents of each of the
Company's Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, and none of the
Company's Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the respective
provisions thereof.

  



  

Section 3.2 _Capitalization; Subsidiaries_.

  



  

(a) As of the close of business on August 5, 2019 (the
"Capitalization Date"), the authorized capital stock of the Company consisted
of (i) 350,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, 208,533,915 of which were
issued and outstanding and none of which were held by the Company as treasury
stock, and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock of the Company,
par value $0.0001 per share, 1,000,000 shares of which constitute a series of
preferred stock designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, 1,000,000
of which were issued and outstanding ("Series A Preferred Stock"), and
1,000,000 shares of which constitute a series of preferred stock designated
as Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, 167,248 of which were issued and
outstanding (or, to the extent not issued or outstanding, had otherwise
accrued until the Capitalization Date) ("Series A-1 Preferred Stock" and
together with Series A Preferred Stock, "Company Preferred Stock").
Except for the foregoing, there are no other classes of capital stock of the
Company and, except for Company Equity Awards, Company Warrants and Company
Preferred Stock, there are no bonds, debentures, notes or other Indebtedness
or Securities of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into or
exercisable for Securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
holders of capital stock of the Company may vote authorized, issued or
outstanding. As of the close of business on the Capitalization Date,
there were (A) outstanding Company Options to purchase 26,426,312 shares of
Company Common Stock; (B) outstanding Company RSU Awards representing 124,422
shares of Company Common Stock; (C) 8,611,196 shares of Company Common Stock
reserved for future issuance under the Company Equity Plans; (D) 9,191,287
shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of Company
Warrants; and (E) 23,344,957 shares of Company Common Stock reserved for

business on the Capitalization Date, the 2014 Warrant had been exercised in

Capitalization Date through the date of this Agreement, there have been (1) no
issuances of any Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock or any other
Securities of the Company other than issuances of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to (i) the conversion of any of Company Preferred Stock
outstanding as of the close of business on the Capitalization Date in
accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation, or (ii) the
exercise, vesting or settlement, as applicable, of any Company Equity Awards
or Company Warrants outstanding as of the close of business on the
Capitalization Date in accordance with the terms of such Company Equity
Awards or Company Warrants and (2) no grants of any Company Equity Awards or
any other equity or equity-based awards.

(b) All of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
have been, and all of the shares of Company Common Stock that may be issued
pursuant to any of the Company Equity Awards, the Company Equity Plans,
Company Warrants and Company Preferred Stock will be, when issued in
accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized and validly
issued and are, or will be when issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Preferred Stock have been duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. The Company has made available to Parent or its counsel
accurate and complete copies of each of the Company Warrants (which copies are
executed) and the forms of stock option and restricted stock unit award
agreements evidencing the Company Equity Awards (together with the forms of
such award agreements filed with the SEC and publicly available), and in
respect of the foregoing forms, other than differences with respect to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock covered thereby, the grant date, the
exercise price, regular vesting schedule and expiration date applicable
thereto, no such stock option or restricted stock unit award agreement
contains material terms that are inconsistent with, or in addition to, such
forms. _Section 3.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the
close of business on the Capitalization Date, each outstanding Company Equity
Award and to the extent applicable, (i) the name and country of residence (if
outside the U.S.) of the holder thereof, (ii) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock issued or issuable thereunder, (iii) the expiration date, (iv)
the exercise price relating thereto, (v) the grant date, (vi) the amount
vested and outstanding and the amount unvested and outstanding, and (vii) the
Company Equity Plan pursuant to which the award was made. Each grant of a
Company Option was duly authorized no later than the date on which the grant
of such Company Option was by its terms to be effective (the "Company Option
Grant Date") by all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable,
approval by the Company Board (or a duly constituted and authorized committee
thereof or other authorized designee) and any required stockholder
approval by the necessary number of votes or written consents. The Company
does not have any liability in respect of any Company Option that was granted
with a per share exercise price that was less than the fair market value of a
share of Company Common Stock on the applicable Company Option Grant Date,
and the Company has not granted any Company Options that are subject to the
provisions of Section 409A of the Code. Each grant of a Company Equity Award
and Company Warrant was made in all material respects, as applicable, in
accordance with (A) the terms of the applicable Company Equity Plan, (B) all
applicable securities Laws, including the NYSE American Company Guide, (C)
the Code, and (D) all other applicable Laws. The Company has the requisite
authority under the terms of the applicable Company Equity Plan, the
applicable award agreements and any other applicable Contract to take the
actions contemplated by _Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.4_ , and the treatment
of Company Warrants and Company Equity Awards described in _Section 2.3_ and
_Section 2.4_ , shall, as of the Effective Time, be binding on the holders of
Company Warrants and Company Equity Awards purported to be covered thereby.
All of the outstanding Company Stock has been sold pursuant to an effective
registration statement filed under the federal securities Laws or an
appropriate exemption therefrom. No Subsidiary of the Company owns
any Securities of the Company.

interim statements of the Company, as may be permitted under Form 10-Q of the
Exchange Act); and (iv) present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company, and the results of operations and cash

reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)

committee of the Company Board (i) all "significant deficiencies" and
"material weaknesses" (as such terms are defined in Auditing Standard No. 5 of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect on the date of
this Agreement) in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves the Company's management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Except as
described in the Company SEC Reports, since January 1, 2016, the Company has
not identified any material weaknesses in the design or operation of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.

  



  

(e) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to
ensure that all information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

  



  

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no SEC Proceedings

there have been no investigations regarding accounting, auditing or revenue
recognition discussed with, reviewed by or initiated at the direction of the
chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer or
general counsel of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Company
Board, any board of directors of any of its Subsidiaries or any committee of
the Company Board or any board of directors of any of its Subsidiaries.

13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the
statements contained in such certifications are true and correct. For
purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the

arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, on the other hand), including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, or any "off-
balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
under the Securities Act), in each case, where the result, purpose or effect
of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving,
or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the
Company SEC Documents (including any audited financial statements and
unaudited interim financial statements of the Company included therein).

the Company financial statements no later than the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Each Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning

from the Internal Revenue Service that such Benefit Plan is so qualified and
exempt from taxation under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code, and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that would be expected to
adversely affect such qualification.

non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406

Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation to any material
tax or penalty.

pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or anticipated with

its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation to any material liability.

  



  

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligations to provide any health or other welfare benefits (whether or not

has incurred or will incur any material liability under Sections 4980D and

give rise to the incurrence of such material liability.

Disclosure Letter_ , neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby, or any termination of employment or service (or other event or
occurrence) in connection therewith will (i) entitle any current or former
employee, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
any payment or benefit (or result in the funding of any such payment or
benefit) or result in any forgiveness of Indebtedness with respect to any such
persons; (ii) increase the amount of any compensation, equity award or other
benefits otherwise payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iii)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment, funding or vesting of any

material compliance with, Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(l) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has used the
services or workers provided by third Person contract labor suppliers,
temporary employees, "leased employees" (as that term is defined in Section
414(n) of the Code), or individuals who have provided services as independent
contractors to an extent that would reasonably be expected to result in
the disqualification of any of the Benefit Plans or the imposition of
material penalties or excise taxes with respect to the Benefit Plans by the
Internal Revenue Service, the United States Department of Labor or the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and no such individuals are entitled to any
benefits under any Benefit Plan that they have been improperly denied by
reason of their misclassification as independent contractors.

Subsidiaries to use any Intellectual Property.

against unauthorized access, disclosure, use, modification or other misuse.
To the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no material

all such employee's or consultant's, as applicable, Intellectual Property in
such contribution that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries do not already

Contracts from all current and former employees, consultants, contractors, and
other Persons involved in the development of any Intellectual Property with

Intellectual Property; (ii) materially restrict the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' business in order to accommodate any Person's right in or to

relating to invention disclosure, invention assignment, non-disclosure,
limitation of use, or non-competition, or (B) any applicable material non-
disclosure obligation or restrictive covenant obligation for the benefit of
any other Person, including any former employer of such employee or
consultant, by virtue of such employee or consultant being employed by or

has developed any technology, Software or other copyrightable, patentable or
otherwise proprietary work for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is

(including rights in or to Intellectual Property) in or to such technology,
Software or other copyrightable, patentable or otherwise proprietary work or
which has been subject to any confidentiality or use restrictions. To the
Knowledge of the Company, all disclosures by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person of material Company-owned confidential information
and Trade Secrets, or confidential information and Trade Secrets as to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries had or has an obligation of secrecy,
have been made pursuant to the terms of a written contractual obligation
between the Company or its applicable Subsidiaries and such third Person
requiring that such third Person not disclose or otherwise use such
confidential information or Trade Secrets for any purpose other than those
expressly authorized in writing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable.

(m)  With regard to proprietary Software that is developed or used by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or is currently in development by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and other than as has not been, and would
not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material
to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole: (i)

without the user's consent, or (B) incorporates, embeds or is distributed or
installed with, statically or dynamically links with, or otherwise interacts
with any Software that is distributed as free software, open source software,
or pursuant to similar licensing or distribution models, including pursuant to
any GNU general public license or limited general public license, in a manner
that would require any Software included in the Company Owned IP, including
any source code associated with such Software, to be disclosed, licensed, or
divulged to any other Person; (iv) current copies of the source code for all
such material Software are recorded on machine readable media, clearly
identified and securely stored (together with the applicable documentation)
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and (v) no capital expenditures are

the Company, the Company Licensed IP) is subsisting (or in the case of
applications, applied for) and to the Knowledge of the Company, valid and
enforceable. No issued Patents or pending patent applications included in the
Company Owned IP are subject to any interference, reissue, reexamination,
opposition, inter parties review, covered business method review, post-grant

conducted.

  



  

(p) Except as set forth on _Section 3.16(p)_ of the _Company

duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the character or location of the property owned, leased
or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly

to, individually or in the aggregate, impair in any material respect the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and pay the
Aggregate Merger Consideration and other amounts required to be paid by

action by Parent and Merger Sub, and (in the case of the Merger, except for

Authorities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to obtain approval from, or to avoid a Proceeding by, any

Merger. Each of the parties hereto shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, upon a date to be mutually
agreed upon by the parties hereto, make its respective filings under the HSR

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall be
required to, and without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates will, grant or offer to
grant any accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise), or make any
payment, to any third Person in connection with seeking or obtaining its
consent to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being

in this _Section 5.3_ , each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation of any required
governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any
investigation or other inquiry from a Governmental Authority or in connection
with any Proceeding initiated by a private party, in each case, under any
applicable Antitrust Laws, including (i) promptly informing the other party of
such inquiry or Proceeding, (ii) consulting in advance before making any
presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, or in connection
with any such Proceeding, to any other Person, and supplying each other with

of the other party in connection with all written communications (including
any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals) between either party and any Governmental Authority, or
in connection with any such Proceeding, between either party and any other
Person with respect to this Agreement; _provided_  that materials required to
be provided by one party to another pursuant to this _Section 5.3(b)_ may be
redacted (A) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company,
(B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (C) as
necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns or may be provided on an outside counsel basis, if
reasonably appropriate. In addition, each of the parties hereto will give
reasonable notice to and consult with the other party in advance of any
meeting or substantive telephone call or conference with any Governmental
Authority, or in connection with any such Proceeding, with any other Person,
and to the extent permitted by the Governmental Authority, give the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, telephone
call or conference.

  



  

(c)  The parties shall consult with each other with respect to
obtaining all permits and Consents necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
none of Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be required to enter into one
or more agreements prior to the Closing with respect to any transaction to
divest, hold separate or otherwise take any action that limits the Parent's
or any of its Affiliates' (including, following the Closing, the Company's or
any of its Subsidiaries') freedom of action, ownership or control with respect
to, or their ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any of their
respective businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties
(each, a "Divestiture Action") or take any Divestiture Action or otherwise
agree to or proffer to sell, divest, hold separate, lease, license, transfer,
dispose of or otherwise encumber or impair or take any other action with
respect to Parent's or any of its Affiliates' ability to own or operate any
assets, properties, businesses or product lines of Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, any assets, properties,
businesses or product lines of the Company or its Subsidiaries); and none of
Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be required to take any action
contemplated in this _Section 5.3(d)_ in connection with any Proceeding by a
Person other than a Governmental Authority, and the Company shall not, and
shall not cause or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, unless requested to do
so by Parent, commit to or effect any action contemplated in this _Section
5.3(d)_.

Section 5.4   _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. From the date
of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date, if
any, on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 7.1_ ,
the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to
Parent and Merger Sub, and their respective Representatives, reasonable
access, to be coordinated through the Company or its designated
Representatives in accordance with such reasonable procedures as they may
establish, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to all of
the officers, employees, agents, properties, books, contracts and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and during such period, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly all
other information concerning the business, properties and personnel of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request;
_provided_ , _that_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may restrict
or prohibit such access to the extent that (a) any applicable Law requires
the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit such access; (b)
granting such access would violate any Contract or material obligation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with a third Person with respect to
confidentiality or otherwise breach, contravene or violate, constitute a
default under, or give a third Person the right to terminate or accelerate any
obligations under, any then-effective Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or would disclose any information that is
competitively sensitive; or (c) granting access to such documents or
information would reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of any
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege
in respect of such documents or information, _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall use good faith efforts to communicate the applicable
information to Parent in a manner that would not violate applicable Law,
Contract or material obligation or waive such privilege or work-
product doctrine. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub will
hold any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.4_  in accordance
with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation pursuant to
this _Section 5.4_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by the Company hereunder. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be
required to provide any access or make any disclosure to Parent pursuant to
this _Section 5.4_ to the extent such access or information is reasonably
pertinent to a litigation where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse
parties.

  



  

Section 5.5   _No Solicitation_.

  



  

(a)  From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Section 7.1_ , except as expressly provided in _Section
5.5(b)_ or _Section 5.5(d)_ , (i) the Company shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and instruct its and
its Subsidiaries' Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, all existing activities, discussions, negotiations and
communications, if any, with any Persons (or any of their Representatives)
with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal (other than Parent or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); and (ii) the Company shall not, and shall
not permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives to,
directly or indirectly, (A) initiate, seek, solicit, facilitate or knowingly
encourage, or knowingly induce the making, submission or announcement of, any
Company Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any negotiations or discussions with, or furnish or cause to
be furnished any non-public information or data to, or furnish access to the
Company's (or any of its Subsidiaries') properties with respect to, any
Person (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives)
relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or
offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Acquisition
Proposal (other than informing any Persons of the provisions of this _Section
5.5_ ), or grant any waiver or release under (or terminate, amend or modify
any provision of) any confidentiality agreement to which the Company is a
party except to the extent to allow an applicable party to make a Company
Acquisition Proposal in compliance with _Section 5.5(b)_ , (C) execute or
enter into any binding or non-binding letter of intent, agreement in
principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other agreement, commitment, arrangement or understanding relating to or in
connection with, or that is intended to lead to, any Company Acquisition
Proposal (each, an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement"), (D) submit to the
stockholders of the Company for their approval any Company Acquisition
Proposal or Company Superior Proposal, or (E) resolve to do, or agree or
publicly announce an intention to do, any of the foregoing.

  



  

   

59

 



    



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
5.5(a)_ , at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries receives, after the date hereof, a bona
fide written Company Acquisition Proposal from a third Person that did not
result from a breach of this _Section 5.5_ , then the Company may contact such
third Person to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (i) furnish
information concerning its business, properties or assets to such Person
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which shall be
provided to Parent within forty-eight (48) hours after execution) and (ii)
negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person
concerning such Company Acquisition Proposal, in each case of clause (i) and
(ii), if the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company's
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that (A) such Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to or
result in a Company Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board's
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company (1) shall promptly (and in
any case within forty-eight (48) hours) provide Parent notice (x) of the
receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include, if
applicable, a complete, unredacted copy of such Company Acquisition Proposal,
and (y) of any inquiries, proposals or offers received by the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its or its Subsidiaries' Representatives
concerning a Company Acquisition Proposal or proposal that is
reasonably likely to constitute or lead to or result in a Company Acquisition
Proposal, and disclose the identity of the other party (or parties) and, if
applicable, the material terms (including any amendments thereto) of such
inquiry, offer or proposal (2) shall promptly (and in any case within forty-
eight (48) hours) make available to Parent all information, including copies
of all written materials, provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or its or its Subsidiaries' Representatives to such party but not
previously made available to Parent and (3) shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a reasonably prompt basis (and, in any case, within forty-
eight (48) hours) of any significant development, discussions or negotiations
(including amendments and proposed amendments) relating to any such Company
Acquisition Proposal or any material change to the financial or other material
terms of any such Company Acquisition Proposal or such other inquiry, offer
or proposal (including by providing copies of all required proposals related
thereto that have not already been provided pursuant to clauses (1)(x) or (y)
above, respectively).

  



  

   

60

 



    



  

  

(c)  Except as expressly permitted by _Section 5.5(d)_ or _Section
5.5(e)_ , neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose
to withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, (ii) approve, authorize, declare advisable, endorse or
recommend (or publicly propose to approve, authorize, declare advisable,
endorse or recommend) any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to include
in the Proxy Statement the Company Recommendation, (iv) fail to recommend
against any Company Acquisition Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer
subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10)
Business Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act) of such tender or exchange offer (any action described in
clauses (i) through (iv) of this sentence being referred to as a "Company
Adverse Recommendation Change"), or (v) adopt or approve, or propose to adopt
or approve, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or
enter into, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement permitted under _Section 5.5(b)_ ).

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company or the Company Board receives a Company Superior Proposal, the Company
Board may authorize and cause the Company to (i) effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ and concurrently with such termination enter into a
definitive agreement providing for such Company Superior Proposal (subject to
the satisfaction of its obligations under _Section 7.3_ ) if (A) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; (B) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it
intends to take such action; (C) the Company has provided Parent a copy of the
proposed definitive agreements (and any related agreements) relating to such
Company Superior Proposal (and has informed Parent of the identity of the
Person making such Company Superior Proposal); and (D) if prior to 11:59
p.m., New York City time, on the second (2nd) Business Day following the
notice delivered pursuant to clause (B) of this _Section 5.5(d)_ , the Company
and its Representatives shall have received a written proposal made by Parent
to amend this Agreement or enter into an alternative transaction with the
Company, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with the Company's financial advisor and outside legal counsel),
after considering and taking into account the terms of any proposed amendment
or modification to this Agreement or a possible alternative transaction made
by Parent in writing solely during such period, that (1) the Company
Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the notice described in clause
(B) of this _Section 5.5(d)_ still constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal and (2) the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
other than in connection with a Company Superior Proposal (which shall be
subject to _Section 5.5(d)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section 5.5(e)_
), prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board
may, in response to a Company Intervening Event, effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change if (i) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the failure
to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and (ii) the Company
has notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 5.5(e)_ (which notice shall
reasonably specify the facts and circumstances providing the basis of the
Company Intervening Event and for the Company Board's determination to effect
the Company Adverse Recommendation Change).

  



   

61

 



    

  



  

(f)  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company
or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending
disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its
stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the failure of
the Company Board to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) in no event shall this _Section 5.5(f)_
permit the Company or the Company Board to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change except as otherwise permitted pursuant to
_Section 5.5(d)_ or _Section 5.5(e)_ , (B) in no event shall this _Section
5.5(f)_ affect, modify or supplement the definition of Company Adverse
Recommendation Change herein (or to the consequences thereof in accordance
with this Agreement) and (C) any such disclosure (other than issuance by the
Company of a "stop, look and listen" communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) that addresses or
relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the
Company Board with respect to this Agreement or a Company Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Company Board in connection with such communication publicly states that its
recommendation with respect to this Agreement has not changed or refers to
the prior recommendation of the Company Board, without disclosing any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided further_ that any factually accurate
public statement that describes the Company's receipt of a
Company Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect
thereto shall not be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.
The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the text of any disclosure
proposed to be made pursuant to this _Section 5.5(f)_ reasonably in advance
of such disclosure.

  



  

Section 5.6   _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and
Insurance_.

  



  

(a)  From and after the Effective Time through the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless
each director and officer of the Company at or prior to the Effective Time
(the "DandO Indemnified Parties") with respect to all claims, liabilities,
losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) in connection with any Proceeding, whenever asserted, based on or
arising out of, in whole or in part, (i) the fact that a DandO Indemnified Party
was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (ii) acts or omissions by such DandO Indemnified Party in the
DandO Indemnified Party's capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company or taken at the request of the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company (including in connection with serving
at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer,
employee agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person), in each case under
(i) or (ii), at, or at any time before, the Effective Time (including any
Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the Merger or the enforcement of
this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any DandO
Indemnified Party), to the fullest extent permitted or required by applicable
Law. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will Parent have any obligations
or liabilities to DandO Indemnified Parties under this _Section 5.6(a)_ , other
than those obligations or liabilities that the Surviving Corporation will
have to DandO Indemnified Parties under this _Section 5.6(a)_.

  



   

62

 



    



  

  

(b)  Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification
and exculpation from liabilities, including advancement of expenses, for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of the DandO Indemnified Parties as provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation, the Bylaws, or any indemnification Contract between such DandO
Indemnified Parties and the Company set forth on _Section 5.6(b)_ of the
_Company Disclosure Letter_ and a copy of which was provided to Parent, (in
each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement) shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. Without limiting the
foregoing, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses provisions equivalent to the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
solely with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any DandO
Indemnified Parties; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any action pending or asserted or any claim made
for indemnification within such period shall continue until the disposition
of such action or resolution of such claim. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their respective
terms, each of the covenants contained in this _Section 5.6_. In addition,
from the Effective Time until six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent
will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance any expenses
(including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any DandO Indemnified Party
under this _Section 5.6_ (including in connection with enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations referred to this in this _Section 5.6_ ) as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided that
the individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is determined that such Person is not entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to this _Section 5.6(b)._

  



  

(c)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the
Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of or
after the Effective Time to, purchase a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy
with reputable insurers, with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Company's existing policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance, with respect to matters arising on or
before the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions or actions contemplated by this Agreement), and Parent shall
cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full
term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase
or pay for insurance hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not pay, and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay, in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date of this Agreement in respect of such "tail" policy. If the Company or
the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies prior to, as of or after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of directors'
and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that after the Effective
Time, Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300%
of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto,
but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable
for such amount.

  



  

   

63

 



    



  

(d)  The covenants contained in this _Section 5.6_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Parties and their
respective heirs and representatives, and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under the Company's constituent documents, by
Contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under this _Section 5.6_ may not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any of the DandO
Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.6_ applies unless (i) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (ii) the
affected DandO Indemnified Parties will have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the DandO
Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.6_ applies will be third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.6_ ).

  



  

(e)  In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors or assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.6_.

  



  

Section 5.7   _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event
whose occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be, could reasonably be
expected to cause any condition set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_
not to be satisfied at any time from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time; and (b) any notice or other communication from any third
Person alleging that the consent of such third Person is or may be required
in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (i) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-occurrence,
as the case may be, could reasonably be expected to cause any condition set
forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.3_ not to be satisfied at any time from
the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time; and (ii) any notice or other
communication from any third Person alleging that the consent of such third
Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties hereto or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto hereunder and any
failure to give such notice with respect to clauses (b) or (c) above, or (ii)
or (iii) above, as applicable, shall not constitute a breach of this _Section
5.7_ for purposes of _Section 6.2(b)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_.

  



  

   

64

 



    



  

Section 5.8   _Public Disclosure_. Parent and the Company shall
mutually agree on the initial press release or releases with respect to the
execution of this Agreement. Thereafter, during the period that this
Agreement remains in effect, except as otherwise expressly permitted by this
Agreement, neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective
Affiliates, shall issue any press release or other announcement with respect
to the Merger, the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or this
Agreement without the prior consent of the other party (such consent not to be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), except as such press release
or other announcement may be required by Law or the rules of a national
securities exchange or trading market on which such party's Securities are
listed, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall use its reasonable efforts to provide the other party with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such release or announcement in advance
of its issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 5.8_ shall not apply to any press release or other
announcement (i) made by the Company with respect to or in connection with a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change effected by the Company Board in
accordance with this Agreement, (ii) made by the Company or Parent concerning
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby in
connection with a determination by the Company or the Company Board in
accordance with _Section 5.5(b)_ or _Section 5.5(d)_ that a Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to constitute, a
Company Superior Proposal, or (iii) made by the Company or Parent in
connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement, the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, _provided_ , _however_ , that
in the case of the preceding clause (i) or (ii), to the extent not
prohibited by applicable Law, the disclosing party gives the other party
reasonable advance notice of (including the contents of) its intended press
release or other announcement, and (b) to the extent the content of any press
release or other announcement has been previously approved and made in
accordance with this _Section 5.8_ , no separate approval shall be required in
respect of such content to the extent such content is substantially
replicated in a subsequent press release or other announcement or
substantially consistent with a previously approved press release or
announcement.

  



  

Section 5.9 _Intellectual Property Matters_. The Company shall, prior
to the Closing use reasonable best efforts to ensure that title in all
Company Registered IP is recorded in the name of the Company or one or more
of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and to the extent that any such Company
Registered IP is recorded in any governmental registry in the name of any
Person other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or there are
outstanding encumbrances of any type against such Company Registered IP, use
reasonable best efforts to obtain appropriate assignments, discharges or
other documents intended to place record ownership in the name of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or effect the discharge prior to the Closing, as
applicable. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that all
maintenance, annuity and other fees and all filings necessary to assure the
continued enjoyment of any issued Company Registered IP, and all amendments,
responses to office actions, issue fees and other fees and filings
necessary to maintain the pendency of and pursue the prosecution of any
pending applications have been and will be paid or filed on a timely basis
through the Closing.

the earlier of (i) the date that is twelve (12) months following
the Effective Time and (ii) the date on which the employment of an employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who continues his or her employment
with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates
following the Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee") terminates,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates shall
provide each Continuing Employee with (A) an annual base salary at least equal
to the annual base salary provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (B) cash bonus and cash incentive opportunities
that are no less favorable than the cash bonus and cash incentive
opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (C) severance payments and benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance payments and benefits to which such Continuing
Employee would be entitled under the applicable Benefit Plan in effect as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (D) employee benefits that are
no less favorable (in the aggregate) to the employee benefits (excluding for
such purposes any defined benefit pension benefits and any equity based
compensation plans) provided to such Continuing Employee as of

(b) If the Closing occurs (i) prior to the completion of the 2019
fiscal year or (ii) after the completion of the 2019 fiscal year but prior to
the payment of bonuses with respect to such fiscal year, Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) shall pay an annual bonus
under the applicable bonus plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
respect of the 2019 fiscal year to each eligible employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries based on actual performance levels as of the date of
this Agreement, extrapolated through the last day of the 2019 fiscal year (if
applicable), as calculated by the Company in good faith, which payment shall
be made at the time such bonuses would ordinarily be paid to eligible
employees by the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of such
plans and in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. If the Closing occurs
during the 2020 fiscal year, Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) shall pay a pro-rated annual bonus under the
applicable bonus plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of the
portion of the 2020 fiscal year that occurs prior to the Closing Date to each

level performance through the Closing Date, which payment will be made within
thirty (30) days following the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Parent agrees that each Continuing Employee shall, as of the
Effective Time, receive full credit for service with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accrual under the employee
benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Affiliates in which such Continuing Employee becomes
a participant (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any
defined benefit pension plan or employer subsidized retiree medical
benefits); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall result in the
duplication of any benefits for the same period of service. With respect to
each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates for the benefit of
Continuing Employees (including any medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision
benefit plans), Parent shall (i) cause to be waived any eligibility waiting
periods, any evidence of insurability requirements or required physical
examinations, actively-at-work requirements and the application of any pre-
existing condition limitations under such plan to the extent such were waived
or satisfied under the comparable health or welfare benefit plan of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time;
and (ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit under any such
plans for all amounts paid (or otherwise deemed paid) by such
Continuing Employee under any similar Benefit Plan for the plan year that
includes the Effective Time for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments
and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the plans maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable,
for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs; _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent's obligations under this clause (ii) shall be subject to its
receipt of all necessary information, from either the Company or such
Continuing Employee, related to such amounts paid by such Continuing
Employee.

(d) If directed in writing by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate, effective as of
immediately prior to the Closing, any and all Benefit Plans intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a "Company 401(k) Plan"). No
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide Parent with evidence that the Company has taken action to
terminate each Company 401(k) Plan (effective as of immediately prior to the
Closing) pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board, as the case may be. The
form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and
approval of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If
the Company terminates each Company 401(k) Plan at the written direction of
Parent as described in the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall, or
shall cause one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, cause a Code Section
401(k) arrangement sponsored or maintained by the Parent or any such
Subsidiary or Affiliate (each, a "Parent 401(k) Plan") to permit each
Continuing Employee participating in such a terminated Company 401(k) Plan as
of immediately prior to the Closing Date to elect to rollover his or her
account balances in such Company 401(k) Plan (including earnings through the
date of transfer and promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans) to an
applicable Parent 401(k) Plan, in each case in accordance with the terms of
the applicable Company 401(k) Plan and Parent 401(k) Plan. The Company and
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate to
effectuate any such rollovers, including by exchanging any necessary
participant records or engaging any recordkeepers, administrators,
providers, insurers, or other third parties.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ are solely for the benefit
of the parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section
5.10_ shall create such rights in any such Persons. Nothing herein shall (i)
guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time
and for any reason; (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates, as applicable, to continue any Benefit Plans, or
other employee benefit plans or arrangements or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; or (iii) amend
any Benefit Plans or other employee benefit plans or arrangements.

Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

from the agents under the Existing Credit Agreement in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent relating to the repayment in full
of all obligations thereunder or secured thereby, the termination of all
commitments in connection therewith and the release of all Liens securing the
obligations thereunder (the "Payoff Letter"). The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver
to Parent (or the agent under the Existing Credit Agreement, in the case of
prepayment and termination notices) on or prior to the Closing, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, all the documents, filings and
notices required for the termination of commitments under the Existing Credit
Agreement and the release of all Liens securing the obligations thereunder,
including the filing of UCC termination statements, terminations of control
agreements, terminations of Intellectual Property security agreements and
delivery of possessory collateral, which shall in each case be subject to the
occurrence of the Closing and the repayment in full of all obligations then
outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement. At the Closing, Parent shall
pay or shall cause to be paid, in full and in immediately available funds,
any and all amounts outstanding and then due and payable under the
Existing Credit Agreement in accordance with the Payoff Letter.

  



  

Section 5.14 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the

Laws and the rules and policies of the NYSE American to cause the delisting
of the Company and of the shares of Company Common Stock from the NYSE
American as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the
deregistration of the shares of Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after such delisting. The Company shall not cause the
Company Common Stock to be delisted from the NYSE American prior to
the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 5.15 _State Takeover Laws_. If any state takeover statute
becomes or is deemed to become applicable to the Company, the Voting and
Support Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then the Company Board shall take any and all actions within its
control as are necessary to render such statutes inapplicable to the
foregoing.

to a customary joint defense agreement), but not control, the defense or
settlement of, any stockholder litigation against the Company or its
directors or executive officers relating to or in connection with
this Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether commenced prior to or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to

officers relating to or in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, without the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). The Company shall promptly notify Parent
of any such litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed
with respect to the status thereof.

  



  

Section 5.17 _Resignations_. Prior to the Effective Time, upon Parent's
request, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
director of the Company and any director of a Subsidiary of the Company, to

Returns are filed, the Company shall provide a copy to the Parent.

(12) months after any such termination of this Agreement (pursuant to the
foregoing clauses (A) or (B)) the Company consummates a Company Acquisition
Proposal with the party that made such Company Acquisition Proposal (
_provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section 7.3(a)(i)_ , the

73

 



    



  

(ii) the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ ; or

  



  

(iii) Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ ;

  



  

then, in any such case, the Company shall pay to Parent the Company

Any payments required to be made under this _Section 7.3_ shall be made by

Parent, (1) in the case of clause (i) above, within five (5) Business Days,
following the consummation of the transaction contemplated therein, (2) in
the case of clause (ii) above, immediately prior to or concurrently with

no event later than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement (i) the parties hereto agree that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion and
(ii) following receipt by Parent of the Company Termination Fee in accordance
with this _Section 7.3_ as a result of a termination by Parent, the Company
shall have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to Parent or Merger Sub.

  



  

(c) The Company acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in
this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (ii) without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount
due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for
the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 7.3_ , the Company shall
pay Parent its costs and expenses in connection with such suit (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), together with interest on such amount at an
annual rate equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in

payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the
maximum permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

Section 7.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual
agreement of the parties hereto in writing at any time before the Closing
Date, whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval has
been obtained, no amendment may be made that either by applicable Law or
pursuant to the applicable rules of any applicable stock exchange requires
further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such further
approval of such stockholders having been obtained.

waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance by any other party hereto with any agreement or condition of such
party contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall only be valid if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

or its Affiliates in connection with any bona fide financing arrangement (but

Section 8.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that

are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto agrees that,
prior to any valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Section
7.1_ , it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate

injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide, furnish or post any bond or other

RE: Disposition of Company Preferred Stock and 2018 Warrants pursuant to
Merger Agreement

  



  

Dear [PREFERRED STOCKHOLDER NAME]:

  



  

This letter confirms your agreement with Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), related to the disposition of
Company Preferred Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and 2018 Warrants
(as defined below) in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "
_Merger Agreement_ ") dated as of August 7, 2019 by and among the Company,
Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "),
and Corpus Merger, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into
the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving as a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

You are the sole record owner and Beneficial Owner (as defined below) of (a)
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, (b) shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock,
or (c) warrants to purchase shares of the common stock of the Company, par
value $0.0001 per share, dated March 16, 2018 (" _2018 Warrants_ "), all of
which ownership is as set forth on the table below. For the purposes of
this agreement, " _Beneficial Owner_ " shall have the meaning given to such
term in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, without giving effect to the
limiting phrase "within sixty days" set forth in Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i).

  



  

You agree that (i) the Company Certificate of Designation provides that, in
the Merger, all the holders of the Company Preferred Stock shall have only
the right to receive the Preferred Stock Consideration (that is cash without
interest) pursuant to Section 7(a) of the Company Certificate of Designation
(and that, notwithstanding Section 7(f) of the Company Certificate of
Designation, Section 8 of the Company Certificate of Designation shall not
apply to the Merger), (ii) the amendment of the certificate of
incorporation of the Company and the bylaws of the Company at the Effective
Time of the Merger (and the agreement to do the same upon execution of the
Merger Agreement) is hereby ratified, approved, and confirmed (assuming that
in the Merger the holders of the Company Preferred Stock receive that to
which they are entitled pursuant to Section 7(a) of the Company Certificate of
Designation), and (iii) no provision of Section 11 of the Company Certificate
of Designation requires the prior affirmative vote or written consent of
the holders of a majority of the Company Preferred Stock, voting as a
separate class, for the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement or
effectuate the Merger. To the extent that you have any rights or options under
Section 8 of the Company Certificate of Designation in connection with the
Merger, you hereby irrevocably waive any such rights or options (assuming that
in the Merger you receive that to which you are entitled pursuant to Section
7(a) of the Company Certificate of Designation).

  



  



    



 



     

You further agree that, at the Effective Time of the Merger, as contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, each of your 2018 Warrants will be cancelled and
converted, by means of a "cashless exercise", into the right to receive from
the Company at the Effective Time a cash payment (without interest) equal to
the product of (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Common Stock Consideration
over (2) the per share exercise price of such 2018 Warrant, and (B) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such 2018 Warrant as of
the Effective Time.

  



  

This agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (a) the
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms prior to the
Effective Time or (b) any amendment to the Merger Agreement without your prior
written consent that (i) decreases the amount or changes the form of the
Preferred Stock Consideration or the Merger Consideration, (ii) imposes any
additional material restrictions on or additional conditions on the payment
of the Preferred Stock Consideration or the Merger Consideration, or (iii)
otherwise amends the Merger Agreement in a manner materially adverse to you
relative to the other stockholders of the Company. In the event of the
