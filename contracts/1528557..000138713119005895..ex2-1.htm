Stock have been duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The Company has made available to Parent or its
counsel accurate and complete copies of each of the Company Warrants (which copies are executed) and the forms of stock option

filed with the SEC and publicly available), and in respect of the foregoing forms, other than differences with respect to the number
of shares of Company Common Stock covered thereby, the grant date, the exercise price, regular vesting schedule and expiration

&ldquo;<B>Company Option Grant Date</B>&rdquo;) by all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the Company
Board (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof or other authorized designee) and any required stockholder approval
by the necessary number of votes or written consents. The Company does not have any liability in respect of any Company Option
that was granted with a per share exercise price that was less than the fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock on
the applicable Company Option Grant Date, and the Company has not granted any Company Options that are subject to the provisions
of Section 409A of the Code. Each grant of a Company Equity Award and Company Warrant was made in all material respects, as applicable,
in accordance with (A) the terms of the applicable Company Equity Plan, (B) all applicable securities Laws, including the NYSE
American Company Guide, (C) the Code, and (D) all other applicable Laws. The Company has the requisite authority under the terms
of the applicable Company Equity Plan, the applicable award agreements and any other applicable Contract to take the actions contemplated
by <U>Section 2.3</U> and <U>Section 2.4</U>, and the treatment of Company Warrants and Company Equity Awards described in <U>Section
2.3</U> and <U>Section 2.4</U>, shall, as of the Effective Time, be binding on the holders of Company Warrants and Company Equity
Awards purported to be covered thereby. All of the outstanding Company Stock has been sold pursuant to an effective registration
statement filed under the federal securities Laws or an appropriate exemption therefrom. No Subsidiary of the Company owns any

or amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment, each Company SEC Document filed pursuant
to the Exchange Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant
to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment became effective prior to the date of this Agreement,
did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made therein not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no amendments or modifications
to the Company SEC Documents that are required to be filed with (or furnished to) the SEC, but that have not yet been filed with
(or furnished to) the SEC. No Subsidiary of the Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.
All of the consolidated audited financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents (i) have been derived from the accounting books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) comply
in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto; (iii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, in all material respects, applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except (A) as may be indicated in such financial statements or in the notes thereto and (B) in the case of
the unaudited interim statements of the Company, as may be permitted under Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act); and (iv) present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company, and the results of operations and cash flows of the Company, as
of the times and for the periods referred to therein (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and subject, in the case
of unaudited interim financial statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments and the absence of footnote disclosure,
none of which, individually or in the aggregate, will be material).</P>

in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &ldquo;<U>Merger Agreement</U>&rdquo;) dated as of August 7, 2019 by and
among the Company, Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&ldquo;<U>Parent</U>&rdquo;), and Corpus Merger,
Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (&ldquo;<U>Merger Sub</U>&rdquo;), pursuant to which, subject
to the terms and conditions thereof, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the &ldquo;<U>Merger</U>&rdquo;),

have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 10.6pt 0 10.95pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">You are
the sole record owner and Beneficial Owner (as defined below) of (a) shares of Series A Preferred Stock, (b) shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock, or (c) warrants to purchase shares of the common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, dated March

agreement, &ldquo;<U>Beneficial Owner</U>&rdquo; shall have the meaning given to such term in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act,
without giving effect to the limiting phrase &ldquo;within sixty days&rdquo; set forth in Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 10.65pt 0 10.95pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">You agree
that (i) the Company Certificate of Designation provides that, in the Merger, all the holders of the Company Preferred Stock shall
have only the right to receive the Preferred Stock Consideration (that is cash without interest) pursuant to Section 7(a) of the
Company Certificate of Designation (and that, notwithstanding Section 7(f) of the Company Certificate of Designation, Section 8
of the Company Certificate of Designation shall not apply to the Merger), (ii) the amendment of the certificate of incorporation
of the Company and the bylaws of the Company at the Effective Time of the Merger (and the agreement to do the same upon execution
of the Merger Agreement) is hereby ratified, approved, and confirmed (assuming that in the Merger the holders of the Company Preferred
Stock receive that to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 7(a) of the Company Certificate of Designation), and (iii) no
provision of Section 11 of the Company Certificate of Designation requires the prior affirmative vote or written consent of the
holders of a majority of the Company Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, for the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement
or effectuate the Merger. To the extent that you have any rights or options under Section 8 of the Company Certificate of Designation
in connection with the Merger, you hereby irrevocably waive any such rights or options (assuming that in the Merger you receive
that to which you are entitled pursuant to Section 7(a) of the Company Certificate of Designation).</P>

Time a cash payment (without interest) equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Common Stock Consideration over

amends the Merger Agreement in a manner materially adverse to you relative to the other stockholders of the Company. In the event
