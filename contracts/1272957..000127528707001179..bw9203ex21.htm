 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 

  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter called this "
_Agreement_ "), dated as of March 1, 2007, among Bristol West Holdings, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), Farmers Group, Inc., a Nevada
corporation (" _Parent_ "), and BWH Acquisition Company, a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "). The
Company and Merger Sub are sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as
the " _Constituent Corporations_ ".

 

 RECITALS

 

  WHEREAS, the parties to this Agreement desire to effect
the acquisition of the Company by Parent through a merger of the Company and
Merger Sub;

 

  WHEREAS, in furtherance of the foregoing and in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), the
respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have unanimously approved this Agreement, the merger of Merger Sub with and
into the Company with the Company as the Surviving Corporation (the " _Merger_
") and the transactions contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and have adopted and declared advisable
this Agreement;

 

  WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Parent is entering into a Voting Agreement with certain
significant stockholders of the Company (the " _Voting Agreement_ ") pursuant
to which each of those stockholders have agreed, subject to the terms thereof,
to vote all shares of the Company owned by them in accordance with the terms
of the Voting Agreement; and

  

 WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this Agreement and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.

 

  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

 ARTICLE I.

 

  _The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

 

  1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the
DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective
Time. Following the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in
the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to and assume
all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with Section 259 of
the DGCL. At the election of Parent, any direct or indirect subsidiary of
Parent may be substituted for Merger Sub as a constituent corporation in the
Merger.

     
  

  1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually
agreed in writing between the Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Simpson Thacher and
Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern
Time) on the second business day (the " _Closing Date_ ") following the day on
which the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _business day_ " shall mean any day
ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day
on which banks are required or authorized to close in the City of New York.

  

 1.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") executed and acknowledged by the parties in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

 ARTICLE II.

 

  _Certificate of Incorporation and 
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_

 

  2.1. _The Certificate of Incorporation_. The
certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended as of the
Effective Time as a result of the Merger so as to read in its entirety as set
forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto and as so amended, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ "), until duly
amended as provided therein or by applicable Laws.

 

  2.2. _The Bylaws_. The parties hereto shall
take all actions necessary so that the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein
or by applicable Laws, except that references to Merger Subs name shall be
replaced with references to the Company.

      
  

 ARTICLE III.

 

  _Officers and Directors 
of the Surviving Corporation_

 

  3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take
all actions necessary so that the board of directors of Merger Sub at the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be elected or
otherwise validly appointed as the directors of the Surviving Corporation
until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Charter and the Bylaws.

 

  3.2. _Officers_. The officers of the Company at
the Effective Time (other than those officers who Merger Sub determines shall
not remain as officers of the Surviving Corporation) shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their
successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and
the Bylaws.

 

 ARTICLE IV.

 

  _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; 
Exchange of Certificates_

 

  4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the
Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of the
Company:

 

  (a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the
common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively,
the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company (as
treasury stock or otherwise) or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties (each, an
" _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be
converted into the right to receive $22.50 per Share in cash, less any
required withholding Taxes as described in _Section 4.2(f)_ and
without interest (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective
Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and in the case of book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ "), the names of the former registered holders shall be removed from
the registry of holders of such shares and each certificate (a " _Certificate_
") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, without interest.

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share (other than any Excluded Shares held by any of the Companys wholly-owned Subsidiaries) referred to in _Section 4.1(a)_ shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

     
  

  (c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each
share of common stock, without par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of
common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

  4.2. _Exchange of Certificates. _

 

  (a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent
selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of
the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary
for the Paying Agent to make payments under _Section 4.1(a)_ (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Company will enter
into a paying agent agreement on customary terms, which terms shall be in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent prior to the Effective Time. The
Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; 
_provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable under _Section 4.1(a)_ shall be promptly returned to the
Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are losses with respect to any
such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the
level required to make prompt cash payment under _Section 4.1(a)_ , Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly replace or restore
the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments under _Section
4.1(a)_.

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within two business days), the Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(e)_ ) or Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(e)_ ) and Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(e)_ ) or Book-Entry Share to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(f)_ ) equal to (A) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(e)_ ) or Book-Entry Share multiplied by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be.

     
  

 In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon
due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share may be issued to such
transferee if the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly representing such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

  

 (c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article IV_.

 

  (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments
thereof) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 180
days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation.
Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore
complied with this _Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(f)_) upon
due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 4.2(e)_ ) or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual,
corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association,
organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature.

 

  (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_.
In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as
may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(f)_ ) equal to the
number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

  

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and the regulations promulgated and rulings issued thereunder, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. 

     
  

 To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts (i) shall
be remitted by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Paying Agent, Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be.

 

  4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans; Warrants. _

 

  (a) _Options_. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding option to purchase Shares granted under the Stock Plans or
otherwise, vested or unvested (a " _Company Option_ "), shall as of the
Effective Time become fully vested and converted into the right to receive, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no
later than three business days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to the Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration _over_ the exercise
price per Share under such Company Option, less applicable Taxes required to
be withheld with respect to such payment. If the applicable exercise price of
any Company Option equals or exceeds the Per Share Merger Consideration, such
Company Option shall be cancelled without payment of additional consideration,
and all rights with respect to such Company Option except as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence shall terminate as of the Effective Time. The
holders of Company Options will have no further rights in respect of any
Company Options from and after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each outstanding warrant to purchase Shares listed on _Section
4.3(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be cancelled immediately prior
to the Effective Time and shall have no right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

  

 (b) _Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Share of restricted stock granted under the Stock Plans, vested or unvested (each a " _Restricted Share_ "), shall as of the Effective Time become fully vested and free of any forfeiture restriction and converted into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three business days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. The holders of Restricted Shares will have no further rights in respect of any Restricted Shares from and after the Effective Time.

 

  (c) _Phantom Stock._ At the Effective Time,
each Share contained in each non employee directors deferred compensation
account (each a " _Phantom Share_ ") under the Companys Non-Employee
Directors Deferred Compensation and Stock Award Plan (the " _Non Employee
Directors  Plan_") shall as of the Effective Time entitle the beneficiary
thereto to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
(but in any event no later than three business days after the Effective Time),
an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of Phantom
Shares and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration. The holders of Phantom
Shares will have no further rights in respect of any Phantom Shares from and
after the Effective Time.

     
  

  (d) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, the Company, the board of directors of the Company and the
compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company, as
applicable, shall adopt resolutions, and take all other actions they
reasonably believe to be necessary, to implement the provisions of Sections
4.3(a), (b) and (c), without paying or incurring any debts or obligations
(other than the fees and expenses of counsel) on behalf of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation.

  

 4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted; _provided_ that nothing herein shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

 ARTICLE V.

 

  _Representations and Warranties_

 

  5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the
Company_. Except as set forth in the Company Reports filed with the SEC on or
after January 1, 2004 and prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding, in
each case, any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section, in any
section relating to forward looking statements (including future operating
results) and any other disclosures included therein to the extent that they
are generic, cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) or in the
corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered to
Parent by the Company concurrently with entering into this Agreement (the "
_Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that written disclosure of any
item in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be
deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the
relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure
that such disclosure is applicable to such other section or subsection), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

 

  (a) _Organization, Good Standing and
Qualification_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as presently conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is qualified
to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or similar
entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its
assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification,
except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent and
Merger Sub a complete and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws or comparable governing documents of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries, each as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

      
  

 As used in this Agreement, the term (i) " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect
to any Person, any other Person of which at least a majority of the securities
or ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a
majority of the board of directors or other persons performing similar
functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such Person and/or
by one or more of its Subsidiaries, (ii) " _Significant Subsidiary_ " is as
defined in Rule 1.02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated pursuant to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") and (iii)
" _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means a material adverse effect on the
financial condition, business, assets, liabilities, properties or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or that would
prevent or materially impair or materially delay the ability of the Company
to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that none of the following shall
constitute or be taken into account in determining whether there has been or
is a Company Material Adverse Effect:

       

 

  |  

  (A) changes in the economy or financial
markets generally in the United States or other countries in which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries conduct operations or that are the result of acts
of war or terrorism, except to the extent such changes have a disproportionate
impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to
other industry participants;

  
---|--- 
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (B) any loss or threatened loss of business
from any agents, brokers or customers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries directly caused by the announcement or the pendency of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (C) changes in any Law or GAAP or
interpretation thereof after the date hereof;

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (D) any failure by the Company to meet any
estimates of revenues or earnings for any period ending on or after the date
of this Agreement; _provided_ that the exception in this clause (D) shall not
prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect,
circumstance or development underlying such failure has resulted in, or
contributed to, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

  
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (E) a decline in the price or trading
volume of the Company common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "
_NYSE_ "); _provided_ that the exception in this clause (E) shall not prevent
or otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect, circumstance or
development underlying such decline has resulted in, or contributed to, a
Company Material Adverse Effect; and

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (F) any occurrence or condition affecting
the property and casualty insurance or reinsurance industry generally
(including without limitation any change or proposed change in insurance laws
or regulations in any jurisdiction), except to the extent such occurrences or
conditions have a disproportionate impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, relative to other industry participants.

  
       
  

  (b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized
capital stock of the Company consists of 200,000,000 Shares, of which
29,479,864 Shares were outstanding as of the close of business on March 1,
2007, and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which were
outstanding as of the date hereof. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.1(b) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, no Shares are held in the treasury of the
Company or by any of its Subsidiaries. All of the outstanding Shares have
been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and
other than the Shares reserved for issuance as of March 1, 2007, under the
1998 Stock Option Plan for Management and Key Employees and the 2004 Stock
Incentive Plan and the outstanding non-employee options and warrants
(collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ "), the Company has no Shares reserved for
issuance. _Schedule 5.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a
correct and complete list of options, restricted stock, performance stock
units and restricted stock units, if any, outstanding as of the date hereof
under the Stock Plans, including the holder, date of grant, term, number of
Shares and, where applicable, exercise price.  Except as set forth in
_Schedule 5.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or as set forth above,
there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants,
conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase
rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind
that obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any
shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or
acquire, any equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or
outstanding. Upon any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of
the Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and free and clear of any Liens. The Company does not
have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations
for borrowed money the holders of which have the right to vote (or
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the stockholders of the Company on any matter. For purposes of this
Agreement, a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company shall include any
Subsidiary of the Company of which all of the shares of capital stock of such
Subsidiary other than director qualifying shares are owned by the Company (or
a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company).

  

 With respect to the Company Options, there has been no grant of any Company Option since the date of the Companys initial public offering of its common stock, $0.01 par value (the " _IPO_ ") other than 25,166 Company Options granted to employees at fair market value as of the applicable grant date. 

 

  (c) _Subsidiaries_. _Schedule 5.1(c)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and correct list of all of the
Companys Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.1 (c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other
equity securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of
any lien, charge, pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance (each,
a " _Lien_ "), other than Liens that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

     
        

 

  |  

  (d) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

  
---|--- 
     

 

  |  

 

  
     



  |  

  (i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute and

this Agreement and to consummate the Merger. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating

opinion, to such holders. The Company has furnished Merger Sub a correct and
complete copy of such opinion. The Company has obtained the authorization of
JPMorgan to include a copy of its opinion in the Proxy Statement.

  
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (iii) The Requisite Company Vote is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of the capital stock of the Company or of any
of the Companys Subsidiaries necessary to adopt this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby. There are no voting trusts,
proxies or similar agreements, arrangements or commitments to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or of which the Company has
Knowledge with respect to the voting of any shares of capital stock of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the Voting Agreement.

  |  

 qualified to do business, no notices, reports, submissions or other filings
are required to be made by the Company with, nor are any consents,
registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to be obtained by
the Company from, any federal, state, local or foreign governmental or

in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by the Company and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, except those that the failure to make or obtain would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  
---|--- 
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the

breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation
or bylaws of the Company or the comparable governing instruments of any of its
Significant Subsidiaries, (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a

Subsidiaries pursuant to any material agreement, lease, license, contract,

violation of any Law to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
subject, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any such breach,
violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration or change set forth on
Schedule 5.1(e)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter or that would not,

  |  

  (i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on
a timely basis all forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents
required to be filed or furnished by it with the Securities Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") since January 1, 2004 (the "
_Applicable Date_ ") (the forms, statements, certifications, reports and
documents filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and those filed or

all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
applicable to the Company Reports and complied or will comply, as applicable,
in all material respects with the then-applicable accounting standards. As of
their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the
date of such amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports
filed or furnished with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not,
contain any untrue statement of a

  
       
        

 

  |  

 material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. The Company Reports
filed or furnished on or prior to the date of this Agreement included, and if
filed or furnished after the date of this Agreement, will include all
certificates required to be included therein pursuant to Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (" _SOX_ "), and the internal control report and
attestation of the Companys outside auditors to the extent required by
Section 404 of SOX. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding

ongoing SEC review.

  
---|--- 
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (ii) The Company is in compliance in all material respects
with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of
the NYSE.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     



  |  

  (iii) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including the related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or, in the case
of Company Reports filed after the date hereof, will fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or in the case
of Company Reports filed after the date hereof, will fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated results of operations, retained earnings
and changes in financial position, as the case may be, of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to the absence of notes and normal year-end
audit adjustments), in each case in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") consistently applied during the periods
involved, except as may be noted therein or elsewhere in the Company Reports.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (iv) The Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined by Rule 13a 15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a 15(a) or 15d 15(a) under the Exchange Act. The Company
designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
that is required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within applicable time periods, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures, particularly during the period in which the Company is
preparing such reports under the Exchange Act. Any controls and procedures, no
matter how  well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives, as the Companys are designed to
do. Based on its most recent evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of its disclosure controls and

  
       
        

 

  |  

 procedures performed as required by Rule 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) under the
Exchange Act, and subject to the foregoing, the Company concluded that the
design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures provided
reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures were
effective to accomplish their objectives. The management of the Company has
disclosed in accordance with the Companys applicable policies and procedures,
based on its most recent evaluation of its internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined by Rule 13a 15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
performed as required by Rule 13a 15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, to the
Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors
of the Company (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses (each
as defined by applicable rules under the Exchange Act) in the design or
operation of its internal controls over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting. Since January 1, 2004, the Company has disclosed any
material weakness (as defined by applicable rules under the Exchange Act) in
its internal control over financial reporting and its conclusions regarding
the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures to the extent and
in the manner required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files
or submits under the Exchange Act.

statement of the Company and each of its insurance Subsidiaries as of December
31, 2005, as filed with the insurance Governmental or Entity of such companys
jurisdiction of domicile, including the statutory basis financial statements
of the Company and each of its insurance Subsidiaries as audited by Deloitte and
Touche LLP as of December 31, 2005. The Company Statutory Statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the statutory financial condition and

respects, in conformity with statutory accounting principles prescribed or
permitted by the applicable insurance Governmental Entity as in effect as of
the date thereof (" _SAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis during the period
presented and with prior periods, except as expressly set forth within the
subject Company Statutory Statements. No notice to the Company or any of its
insurance Subsidiaries of deficiencies has been asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Company Statutory Statements, and the Company
Statutory Statements comply in all material respects with all applicable Law.

submitted to the insurance Government Entities in its state of domicile and of
any state where it is licensed or from which it has received a License, and no
deficiency has been asserted with respect to such statutory statements by the
applicable insurance Governmental Entity which has not been cured, waived or
otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of such insurance Governmental Entity
except as set forth in _Schedule 5.1(h)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
or for those deficiencies which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have or be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.    
  

 (g) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.1(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, since December 31, 2005, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in, and have not engaged in any material transaction other than according to, the ordinary and usual course of such businesses consistent with past practices and except as disclosed in the Companys filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents (the " _Public Documents_ "), there has not been:

  (ii) any material change in any method of accounting or
accounting practice by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except as may
be appropriate to conform to changes in statutory or regulatory accounting
rules or GAAP or regulatory requirements with respect thereto;

  
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (iii) any redemption, repurchase or other acquisition of any
shares of capital stock of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries;

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (iv) any granting by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to any of their directors, officers or employees of any increase in
compensation, except for (A) increases in the ordinary course of business or
increases required under any Benefit Plan, (B) any granting to any director or
officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries of the right to receive any
severance or termination pay not provided for under any Benefit Plan, (C) any
entry by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries into any employment,
consulting, severance agreement or arrangement with any director or officer of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or any material amendment of any Benefit Plan
(other than as required by Applicable Law); or

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (v) any material Tax election made or revoked by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any settlement or compromise of any
material Tax liability made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

propose to adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or
otherwise) an Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (1) in the
case of clause (X), prior to taking such action, the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (2) in the case of
clause (Y), the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
such an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that (I) in
the case of an action described in clause (X) of this paragraph, prior to any
such Change in Recommendation and (II) in the case of any action described in
clause (Y) of this paragraph after 12:01 a.m. on April 1, 2007: (A) the

the decision of the board of directors of the Company to take such action and
the reason for taking such action and (y) in the event the decision relates to
an Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition

and, if available, a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with
such party and other material documents, (B) the Company shall have given
Parent five (5) business days after delivery of each such notice to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement (or make another proposal) and shall
have negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed
revisions or other proposal, if any, and (C) the board of directors of the
Company shall have determined in good faith, after considering the results of
such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any,
and after receiving the advice of outside legal counsel that failure to make
such Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and, if such action relates to an
Acquisition Proposal, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ _further_ that, in the event the board of directors of the Company
does not make the determination referred to in clause (C) of this paragraph
but thereafter determines to take an action described in clause (X) or (Y) of
this paragraph, the procedures referred to in clauses (A), (B) and (C) above
shall apply anew and shall also apply to any subsequent withdrawal, amendment

will promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent of receipt by
it, its Subsidiaries or Representatives of (i) any Acquisition Proposal or
indication by any Person that it is considering making an Acquisition

Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (including the material terms and
conditions thereof and of any amendments thereto) and any material

Sub promptly and shall promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub with copies of
notices or other communications received by the Company or any of its

from the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives), (ii) subject to
applicable Laws and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, any
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from the Company, its

or commenced against or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that are related to the transactions contemplated by this

  6.4. _Proxy Statement. _

 

  (a) The Company shall prepare and file with the
SEC, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, a proxy
statement in preliminary form relating to the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy
statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") The Company agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that at
any time prior to the Effective Time, (a) the Proxy Statement will comply in
all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder and (b) none of the information supplied
by it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

  

 (b) The Proxy Statement will include the Company Recommendation unless the board of directors of the Company has withdrawn, modified or amended the Company Recommendation to the extent permitted under _Section 6.2_.

 

  6.5. _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company,
acting through its board of directors, shall take, in accordance with
applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, all reasonable
action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
holders of Shares (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the execution of this Agreement to consider and vote upon
the approval of this Agreement. The written consent of Merger Sub will be
required to adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , that,
in the event that there is present at such meeting, in person or by proxy,
sufficient favorable voting power to secure the Requisite Company Vote, the
Company will not adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting unless the
Company is advised by counsel that failure to do so would result in a breach
of the U.S. federal securities laws or fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors. Subject to _Section 6.2_ hereof, the board of directors of the
Company shall recommend such approval and shall take all reasonable lawful
action to solicit such approval of this Agreement.

     
  

 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, unless this Agreement is

Recommendation, and will submit this Agreement for adoption by the
stockholders of the Company at such meeting. The Company shall keep Parent
updated with respect to the proxy solicitation results as reasonably required
by Parent.

correspondence between the Company and/or any of its Representatives on the
one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.

advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly
as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and
other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,

this Agreement, any notifications, approval applications or the like required
to be filed under the HSR Act and all other merger control laws with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby and Parent shall pay all filing and
similar fees and related expenses payable in connection therewith. The Company
and Parent will each request early termination of the waiting period with
respect to the Merger under the HSR Act. Subject to applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information,

      
  

 Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult with the other on and consider in good
faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the information
relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Proxy Statement), except to the extent that such
information relates solely to the Parents existing business. In exercising
the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and
as promptly as practicable.

 

  (c) _Insurance Approvals._ In furtherance and
not in limitation of _Section 6.6(b)_ , (i) as soon as reasonably practicable

case of any such written notice or communication, shall promptly furnish the

correspondence with the insurance regulators to the extent that such
application or correspondence relates to an issue which, if the Merger were
not consummated would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect
on the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which
applications or correspondence shall be approved in advance by the Company
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and
(iv) the Company shall have the right to participate in and shall, to the
extent practicable, receive reasonable prior notice of, all telephone calls
and meetings to the extent that an issue which, if the Merger were not
consummated would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is reasonably likely to be
discussed and in which case the Companys right to participate shall be
limited to discussions relating to such issue.

  

 (d) _Merger Clearance_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this _Section 6.6_, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each agree to take or cause to be taken the following actions:

       

 

  |  

  (i) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will
promptly inform the other party upon receipt of any material communication
from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. If Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (or any of their
respective affiliates) receives a request for additional information or
documentary material from any such Governmental Entity that is related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will endeavor in
good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and
after consultation with the other party (or approval of the Company if
_Section 6.6(b)_ is

  
---|--- 
       
        

 

  |  

 applicable), an appropriate response in compliance with such request. The
Company agrees not to participate, or to permit its affiliates to participate,
in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it
consults with Parent in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such
Governmental Entity, gives Parent the opportunity to attend and participate.
Each party will advise the other party promptly of any understandings,
undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which the first party proposes to
make or enter into with the Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party will use all reasonable efforts to
resolve any objections that may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulatory Laws, including (subject to first having used all reasonable
efforts to negotiate a resolution to any such objections) contesting and
resisting any action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to have such statute, rule, regulation, executive order,
decree, injunction or administrative order repealed, rescinded or made
inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
party is required to, and the Company may not, without the prior written
consent of Merger Sub, become subject to, consent or agree to, or otherwise
take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding,
agreement or orders, judgments, injunctions, awards, decrees or writs handed
down, adopted or imposed by, including any consent decree, settlement
agreement or similar written agreement with, any Governmental Entity (each, an
" _Order_ ") (A) to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to
conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business
of the Company or any of its affiliates in any manner which, individually or
in the aggregate with all other such requirements, conditions, understandings,
agreements and  Orders, is (1) materially adverse to the Company and its
affiliates, taken as a whole, before giving effect to the Merger or (2)
requires any change in the conduct of business of the Company or any of its
divisions or Subsidiaries as currently conducted which change would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, assets,
liabilities, properties or results of operations of the Company and the Parent
taken as a whole; or (B) requires any change in the conduct of the business of
the Parent or any of its affiliates as currently conducted, which change would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
those affiliates set forth on _Section 6.6(d)(ii)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Letter, taken as a whole, (any of clauses (A) or (B) above, a "
_Burdensome Condition_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company will, upon the request of Merger Sub, become subject to,
or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any
requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order to sell, to hold
separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or
otherwise change the assets or business of the Company or any of its
affiliates, so long as such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement
or Order is binding on the Company only in the event that the Closing occurs.

  
       
  

  6.7. _Access and Reports_. Subject to
applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its

Returns and records and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be
requested; _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.7_
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company herein; _provided_ _further_ that the foregoing shall not require the
Company (a) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in
the Companys good faith opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, would
(i) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate
any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall
have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to
such inspection or disclosure or (ii) violate the competition laws or (b) to
disclose any information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that in the
Companys good faith determination, after consultation with legal counsel, is
deemed to be privileged. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation
or consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the
prompt and timely discharge by such employees of their normal duties. All
requests for information made pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ shall be
directed to the individual or other Person designated by the Company. All such
information shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

 6.8. _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE and the other exchanges on which the common stock of the Company is listed to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from the NYSE and the other exchanges on which the common stock of the Company is listed and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than ten (10) days after the Closing Date.

 

  6.9. _Publicity_.  The initial press release
regarding the Merger shall be a joint press release and thereafter the
Company and Parent each shall use reasonable efforts under the circumstances
to cooperate with each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise
making public announcements with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings
with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national
securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto,
except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer
quotation service or by the request of any Government Entity.

     
  

  6.10. _Employee Benefits. _

 

  (a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide that during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the December 31 following the Effective Time, the Employees
will (i) be provided with base salary and bonus opportunities (including
annual and quarterly bonus opportunities) while they are employed which are no
less than the base salary and bonus opportunities provided by the Company and
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) severance
benefits that are no less favorable than those set forth in the Companys
separation pay plan and (iii) continue each Benefit Plan as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time without change (except as required by
Law); _provided_ that no shares of capital stock of the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective affiliates or any securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for any shares of such capital
stock, or any options, warrants or other rights of any kind to acquire any
shares of such capital stock or such convertible or exchangeable securities
shall not be required to be issued to any Employee under any Benefit Plan
after the Effective Time.

  

 (b) After December 31 following the Effective Time, Parent will cause any employee benefit plans which the Employees are entitled to participate in to take into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting, but excluding benefit accrual, thereunder, service by the Employees as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company (except to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits).

 

  (c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and any successor thereto to honor, fulfill and discharge the
Companys and its Subsidiaries obligations under the agreements identified in
_Section 6.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

  (d) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change
in control" or "change of control" within the meaning of each of the Companys
Benefit Plans will occur upon the Effective Time.

 

  (e) Nothing in this _Section 6.10_ , expressed
or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.10_. Without
limiting the foregoing, no provision of this _Section 6.10_ will create any
third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, director or
consultant of the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of continued
employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter. Nothing in this
_Section 6.10_ is intended (i) to amend any Benefit Plan, (ii) interfere with
Parents or the Surviving Corporations right from and after the period
referenced in _Section 6.10(a)_ above to amend or terminate any Benefit Plan
or (iii) interfere with Parents or the Surviving Corporations right from
and after the Effective Time to terminate the employment or provision of
services by any director, employee, independent contractor or consultant.

  

 6.11. _Expenses_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the transactions contemplated in _Article IV_ , and Parent shall reimburse the Surviving Corporation for such charges and expenses.

  6.12. _Indemnification; Directors  and
Officers Insurance. _

 

  (a) From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent shall also advance
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
_provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former director
and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or related to such
Indemnified Parties service as a director or officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or services performed by such persons at the request of the
Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified
Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any
single such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, except to the
extent that any two or more parties shall have conflicting interests in the
outcome of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) the Side A coverage part (directors and officers liability) of the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the Companys directors and officers as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase comparable 

     
   

DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the Companys directors
and officers as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof; _provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation
be required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of
250% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance;
_provided_ _further_ that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

  (c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or
merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.12_.

 

  (d) The provisions of this _Section 6.12_ are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties.

 

  (e) Following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall include and maintain in effect in its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws for a period of six years after the Effective Time,
provisions regarding the elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers and directors thereof and advancement of expenses
which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in the Companys
Charter and Bylaws as of the date of this Agreement. The rights of the
Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.12_ shall be in addition to any
rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
any applicable Contracts or Laws.

  

 6.13. _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and its board of directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

 

  6.14. _Parent Vote_. Parent shall vote (or
consent with respect to) or cause to be voted (or a consent to be given with
respect to) any Shares and any shares of common stock of Merger Sub

suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity
or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other

  (a) The table of contents and headings herein
are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this

provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or
Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by

  (b) The parties have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provision of this Agreement.

 

  (c) Each party hereto has or may have set forth
information in its respective Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that
corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this
Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to
be disclosed by this Agreement.

 

  9.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be
assignable by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent
of the other parties hereto; provided that prior to the mailing of the Proxy

notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary to
be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all
references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other
subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with
respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other subsidiary as
of the date of such designation, provided that any such designation shall
not impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the
Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this
Agreement is void.  55
