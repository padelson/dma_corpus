owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and X-Rite, Incorporated, a
Michigan corporation (the " _Company_ ").

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent;

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, Merger
Sub has agreed to commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all
outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company
(the " _Shares_ "), at a price of $5.55 per Share, net to the seller in cash
without interest (such price, or any higher price as may be paid in the Offer
in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Per Share Amount_ ");

 

WHEREAS, following consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub shall merge with and
into the Company with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger_ "), in accordance with the Michigan
Business Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ "), pursuant to which each Share that
is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Shares owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company,
which will be canceled with no consideration issued in exchange therefor) will
be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal
to the Per Share Amount, all upon the terms and conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Board of Directors_ ")
has, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously
(i) determined that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are fair and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (ii)

determined to recommend that the Companys stockholders accept the Offer and
tender their Shares to Merger Sub and, to the extent applicable, adopt this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously approved
this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub,
respectively, to enter into this Agreement;

WHEREAS, immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub

delivered to Parent and Merger Sub support agreements (the " _Support
Agreements_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in
connection with this Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE TENDER OFFER

 

Section 1.1 The Offer.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section 8.1_, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
as promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, and in
any event within five (5) Business Days following the date of this Agreement
(or such other later date as the parties may mutually agree in writing),
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer.

(b) The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to,
accept for payment and to pay for any Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to (i) there being validly
tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn prior to any then scheduled
Expiration Date that number of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
which, together with the Shares beneficially owned by Parent or Merger Sub, if
any, shall represent at least a majority of the Shares then outstanding on a
fully diluted basis (including as outstanding only options that are vested as
of that date or that may vest prior to the End Date, if any, including as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby) (the " _Minimum Condition_ ")
and (ii) the satisfaction of those conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (the "
_Tender Offer Conditions_ "). The Company agrees that no Shares held by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any Shares held on behalf of
third parties) will be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

(c) Parent on behalf of Merger Sub expressly reserves the right from time to
time, subject to _Sections 1.1(c)_ and _1.1(e)_ , to waive any Tender Offer
Condition, increase the Per Share Amount and/or make any other changes to the
terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_  that without the prior written
consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub not to (i) decrease the Per Share Amount or change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, (ii) decrease the number of Shares sought
to be purchased in the Offer, (iii) amend or waive satisfaction of the Minimum
Condition, (iv) impose additional conditions to the Offer, (v) modify or amend
the Tender Offer Conditions (other than to waive such Tender Offer Conditions
(other than the Minimum Condition)), (vi) decrease the time period during
which the Offer shall remain open, or (vii) modify or amend any other term of
the Offer, except for any amendment required to be made to be in compliance
with any Law, which amendment is not adverse to the Companys stockholders.

(d) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall
file or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ")
with respect to the Offer which shall contain or incorporate by reference the
offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") and

 



2  related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other ancillary
Offer documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made
(collectively with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer
Documents_ "). Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each agrees to promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect and Merger Sub shall, and Parent further agrees to cause Merger Sub
to, use reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected or
supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as
so corrected or supplemented, to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities laws.
The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any Offer Documents (including each amendment or supplement
thereto) before they are filed with the SEC and Parent and Merger Sub shall
give consideration to all of the reasonable additions, deletions and changes
suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. Merger Sub shall, and
Parent agrees to cause Merger Sub to, provide the Company with (in writing, if
written), and to consult with the Company regarding, any comments (written or
oral) that may be received by Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof. The Company and its counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review any such written and oral comments and
proposed responses and Parent and Merger Sub shall give consideration to all
of the reasonable additions, deletions and changes suggested thereto by the
Company and its counsel.

(e) The Offer to Purchase shall provide for an expiration date of the 20th
Business Day following (and including the day of) the commencement of the
Offer (such date, or such subsequent date to which the expiration of the
Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Merger Sub shall not, and Parent agrees
that it shall cause Merger Sub not to, terminate or withdraw the Offer other
than in connection with the effective termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.1_ hereof. Except as provided in this _Section
1.1(e)_, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub not
to, extend or delay the Expiration Date (or expiration time) without the
prior written consent of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger
Sub and Parent may, without receiving the consent of the Company, extend the
Expiration Date for any period required by applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC, the NASDAQ Global Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") or any other stock
exchange or automated quotation system applicable to the Offer. In addition,
if, on any Expiration Date the sole condition remaining unsatisfied is the
failure of the waiting period under the HSR Act to have expired or been
terminated, then Merger Sub and Parent shall extend the Offer from time to
time until the fifth Business Day after the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. So long as the Offer and this
Agreement have not been terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, if at any
scheduled Expiration Date, the Tender Offer Conditions shall not have been
satisfied or earlier waived, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, extend the Offer and the Expiration Date to a date that is not more
than ten (10) Business Days after such previously scheduled Expiration Date;
provided that Merger Sub shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be
required to cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer beyond the three (3) month
anniversary of the date hereof (the " _End Date_ ").

 

(f) Subject solely to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by
this Agreement) by Merger Sub of the Tender Offer Conditions, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall

 



3  cause Merger Sub to, as soon as possible after the scheduled expiration of
the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with _Section 1.1(e)_), accept
for payment Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
(the date of acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Date_ ," and the time
of acceptance for payment on the Acceptance Date, the " _Acceptance Time_ ")
and promptly pay for such Shares. Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to,
provide or cause to be provided to the Paying Agent on a timely basis the
funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer. In the event the Acceptance Date occurs but
Parent does not acquire a number of Shares sufficient to enable a Short Form
Merger (as defined in _Section 2.8_) to occur, Merger Sub may provide one or
more "subsequent offering periods" for the Offer in accordance with Rule
14d-11 under the Exchange Act for a number of days to be determined by Parent
which shall be not less than three (3) nor more than twenty (20) Business Days
in the aggregate; _provided_ that Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, immediately accept and promptly pay for all Shares tendered
during the initial offering period and immediately accept and promptly pay for
all Shares tendered during each such subsequent offering period, in each case
in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act.

Section 1.2 Company Action.

 

(a) The Board of Directors, at a duly called and held meeting has unanimously
adopted resolutions: (i) determining that the terms of the Offer, the Merger

performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger (including under
Article VII of the Companys Articles of Incorporation); (iii) approving the

contained in Section 780 of the MBCA and Article VI of the Companys Articles
of Incorporation (including determining that this Agreement is a "memorandum

Offer, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby; (v) electing that the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the
Support Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, to
the extent of the Board of Directors power and authority and to the extent
permitted by law, not to be subject to any "moratorium," "control share

any jurisdiction that may purport to be applicable to the Offer, the Merger,
this Agreement, the Support Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby; and (vi) authorizing and approving the Top-Up Option and the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares thereunder. Unless and until a Change of
Recommendation has taken place in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
the Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the foregoing determinations
and approvals in the Offer Documents and the Company hereby consents to the
inclusion of the Recommendation in the Offer Documents.

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer if practicable and otherwise not
later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") that will comply in all

 



4  material respects with the provisions of all applicable Federal securities
laws. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Schedule
14D-9 to be disseminated to the stockholders of the Company concurrently with
the Offer Documents, and in any event will cause such Schedule 14D-9 to be
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as possible.
Subject to any Change of Recommendation in accordance with this Agreement,
the Schedule 14D-9 and the Offer Documents shall contain the Recommendation.
The Company agrees to promptly correct the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that it shall become false or misleading in any material respect (and each of
Parent and Merger Sub, with respect to written information supplied by it
specifically for use in the Schedule 14D-9, shall promptly notify the Company
of any required corrections of such information and cooperate with the Company
with respect to correcting such information) and to supplement the
information contained in the Schedule 14D-9 to include any information that
shall become necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected
or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Companys
stockholders to the extent required by applicable Federal securities laws.
Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including each amendment or supplement thereto)
before it is filed with the SEC and the Company shall give consideration to
all of the reasonable additions, deletions and changes suggested thereto by
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. The Company shall provide Parent and
Merger Sub (in writing, if written), and consult with Parent and Merger
Sub regarding, any comments (written or oral) the Company or its counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 as
promptly as practicable after receipt of such comments. Parent and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written and oral
comments and proposed responses and the Company shall give consideration to
all of the reasonable additions, deletions and changes suggested thereto by
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. 

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall reasonably promptly
following execution of this Agreement (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days) furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders of record,
mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all record holders of
Shares, non-objecting beneficial owners list and security position listings
of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of the most recent practicable
date, and shall reasonably promptly furnish Parent with such additional
information, including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels, security
position listings and computer files, and such other information and
assistance as Merger Sub or its agents may reasonably request for the purpose
of communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares.
Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as
are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in confidence the
information contained in any such labels, listing and files in accordance with
the confidentiality agreement, dated as of January 29, 2012, between the
Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and shall use such
information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, shall promptly deliver (and shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause their agents and
Representatives to deliver) to the Company (or destroy) all copies and any
extract or summaries of such information then in their possession or control.

 



5 Section 1.3 Directors. Effective upon the acceptance for payment by Parent or
Merger Sub for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer which represent at least a majority of the Shares outstanding on a fully
diluted basis (including as outstanding only options that are vested as of
that date or that may vest prior to the End Date, if any), and from time to
time thereafter as Shares are acquired by Parent or Merger Sub, Parent shall
be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next
whole number, on the Board of Directors as will give Parent, subject to
compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder, representation on the Board of Directors equal to at least that
number of directors which equals the product of (i) the total number of
directors on the Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors appointed
or elected pursuant to this sentence and including current directors serving
as officers of the Company and to the number of the Independent
Directors specified below) and (ii) the percentage that the aggregate number
of Shares beneficially owned by Parent or any Affiliate of Parent (including
for purposes of this _Section 1.3_ such Shares as are accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer, but excluding Shares held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) bears to the number of Shares outstanding; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, in the event that Parents designees are appointed or
elected to the Board of Directors, until the Effective Time the Board of
Directors shall have at least two (2) directors who are directors on the date
hereof who are neither officers of the Company nor designees, stockholders,
Affiliates or associates (within the meaning of the Federal securities laws)
of Parent (one or more of such directors, the " _Independent Directors_ ");
_provided_ _further_ , that if there is in office only one Independent
Director, the Board of Directors will take all reasonable action necessary to
cause a person designated by the remaining Independent Director to fill such
vacancy who shall be neither an officer of the Company nor a designee,
stockholder, Affiliate or associate of Parent, and such person shall be
deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement, or, if no
Independent Directors remain, the other directors shall designate two persons
to fill the vacancies who shall be neither an officer of the Company nor
a designee, stockholder, Affiliate or associate of Parent, and each such
person shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this
Agreement. At each such time, the Company will, subject to any limitations
imposed by applicable Law, also cause (a) each committee of the Board of
Directors, (b) the board of directors of each of the Subsidiaries and (c) each
committee of such board of directors of each of the Subsidiaries to include
persons designated by Parent constituting the same percentage of each such
committee or board as Parents designees constitute on the Board of Directors.
The Company shall take all reasonable action necessary to cause Parents
designees to be so elected including, upon request by Parent, subject to the
Companys Articles of Incorporation, promptly increasing the size of the Board
of Directors or exercising its best efforts to secure the resignations of such
number of directors as is necessary to enable Parents designees to be
elected to the Board of Directors in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 1.3_. Subject to applicable Law, and subject to Parent supplying the
Company with the information with respect to itself and its nominees,
officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder within five (5) Business Days after
the date of commencement of the Offer, the Company shall take all
action necessary pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill
its obligations under this _Section 1.3_ and shall mail to the Companys
stockholders no later than ten (10) days prior to the initial Expiration Date
of the Offer such information with respect to the Company and its officers
and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to
fulfill its obligations under this _Section 1.3_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, following

 



6  the time directors designated by Parent are elected or appointed to the
Board of Directors and prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a
majority of the Independent Directors shall be required to (v) amend or
terminate this Agreement on behalf of the Company, (w) exercise or waive any
of the Companys rights or remedies hereunder, (x) extend the time for
performance of Parents or Merger Subs obligations hereunder, (y) take any
other action by the Company in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby required to be taken by the Board of
Directors or (z) approve any other action by the Company which could
adversely affect the interests of the stockholders of the Company (other than
Parent or Merger Sub) with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Independent Directors shall have the authority to
retain counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) at the
reasonable expense of the Company as determined appropriate by the Independent
Directors for the purpose of fulfilling their obligations hereunder and shall
have the authority, after the Acceptance Time, to institute any Action on
behalf of the Company to enforce the performance of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms.

Section 1.4 Top-Up Option.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the 
" _Top-Up Option_ ") exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in
this _Section 1.4_, to purchase at the Per Share Amount up to that number of
newly issued Shares (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of
Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and Merger Sub
at the time of the exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share
more than 90% of the Shares outstanding immediately after the issuance of the
Top-Up Shares on a fully diluted basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-
Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number of Shares in excess of the
Shares authorized and unissued or held in the treasury of the Company at the
time of exercise of the Top-Up Option (including as outstanding only options
that are vested as of that date or that may vest prior to the End Date, if
any). The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only once, in whole but not in
part, after the Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to occur of (A) the
Effective Time and (B) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms.

 

(b) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub
shall give the Company written notice, specifying (i) the number of Shares
owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of such notice (giving effect
to the acceptance of Shares in the Offer) and (ii) a place and a time for the
closing of such purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following
receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Merger Sub specifying, based
on the information provided by Merger Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up
Shares to be purchased by Merger Sub. At the closing of the purchase of Top-
Up Shares, the aggregate purchase price owed by Merger Sub to the Company for
the Top-Up Shares shall be paid to the Company at Parents election, either
(i) entirely in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds or (ii) by (A)
paying in cash by wire transfer of same-day funds an amount equal to not less
than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Shares and (B) issuing to the
Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the aggregate
purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount paid in cash
pursuant to the preceding clause (A) (the " _Promissory Note_ "). The
Promissory Note (i) shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the prime
lending rate prevailing from time to time during such period as published in
the Wall Street Journal, (ii) shall mature on the first anniversary of the
date of execution of the Promissory Note, (iii) shall be full 

 



7  recourse to Parent and Merger Sub, (iv) may be prepaid, at any time, in
whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and (v) shall have no other
material terms. The Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a
certificate representing the Top-Up Shares or, if the Company does not then
have certificated Shares, the applicable number of Book-Entry Shares. Such
certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any legends that are required
by Federal or state securities Laws.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that no Top-Up Shares issued
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will be registered under the Securities
Act and that all such Shares will be issued in reliance upon an applicable
exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Merger Sub is,
and will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor,"
as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub
agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for
the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

(d) Without the prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise
the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement shall not be assigned by
Merger Sub other than to Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent, including by operation of Law or otherwise, and any
attempted assignment in violation of this  _Section 1.4(d)_ shall be null
and void.

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 3.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holders of any securities of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

 



9 (a) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section
3.1(b)_, shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent
the right to receive in cash an amount equal to the Per Share Amount, without
any interest thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All Shares that have
been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
in this _Section 3.1_ shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and the holders of certificates (or evidence of shares in book-entry
form) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares ("
_Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(b) _Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned,
directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time or by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (in
each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of third parties) (the "
_Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such
cancellation and retirement.

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as
the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed
for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

 

Section 3.2 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company
that shall be appointed to act as a paying agent hereunder and approved in
advance by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld)
(and pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of
holders of the Shares, the Company Stock Options and the Company Equity
Awards, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate Merger
Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares), payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_
and (ii) the Option and Stock-Based Consideration payable pursuant to 
_Section 3.3(b)_ (such cash referred to in subsections (a)(i) and (a)(ii)
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than two (2) Business Days following the Closing Date, the
Paying Agent shall (x) mail to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares
were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1_, (A)
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that, in the case of certificated
Shares, delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss

  



10  and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates to
the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Paying Agent may agree and which are reasonably satisfactory
to the Company), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and (y) pay to each
holder of a Company Stock Option or Company Equity Award, a check in an
amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to _Section 3.3_ hereof in
respect of such Company Stock Option or Company Equity Award.

 

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates to the Paying Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in an amount equal to the
product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such holders properly
surrendered Certificates multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender
of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof). Parent and
Merger Sub shall pay all stock transfer Taxes with respect to the sale and
transfer of any Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of
the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, properly endorsed
or otherwise in proper form for transfer and in each case accompanied by
evidence to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. 

(iii) The Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
under this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Stock Options or Company
Equity Awards, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted and
paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares, Company
Stock Options or Company Equity Awards, in respect of which such
deduction and withholding were made.

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article III.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed
to the former holders of Shares and Company Stock Options or Company Equity
Awards for twelve (12)

 



11  months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not
surrendered their Shares in accordance with this  _Section 3.2_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim
for the Merger Consideration and, if applicable, Option and Stock-Based
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their
Shares or, if applicable, such Company Stock Options or Company Equity Awards.

(e) _No Liability_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent
or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares, Company
Stock Options or Company Equity Awards for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(f)  _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to  _Section 3.2(d)_.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent or Parent, the posting by such person of a bond
in customary amount as indemnity against any Claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the
number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

(h) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger or other
similar extraordinary transaction, the Merger Consideration and Per Share
Amount shall each be equitably adjusted.

 

Section 3.3 Treatment of Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards.

 

(a) Each option to purchase Shares (collectively, the " _Company Stock
Options_ ") granted under the Company stock option plans, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will at
the Effective Time be cancelled and the holder of such Company Stock Option
will, in full settlement of such Company Stock Option, receive from the
Surviving Corporation an amount (less such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law) in cash equal to the product of the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Company Stock
Option multiplied by the total number of Shares subject to such Company Stock
Option, if the award would otherwise vest solely upon the continued employment
of the holder.

 



12 The aggregate amount of such cash received in accordance with this _Section
3.3(a)_ shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Option Consideration_." If
the exercise price per Share of any such Company Stock Option is equal to or
greater than the per share Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option
shall be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock
(" _Company Restricted Shares_ "), restricted stock units (" _Company RSUs_ ")
and other equity-based awards excluding Company Stock Options (collectively,
the " _Company Equity Awards_ "):

 

(i) shall vest in full, if the award would otherwise vest solely upon the
continued employment of the holder, or 

(ii) shall vest as if the target level of performance had been achieved, if
the award would otherwise vest, in whole or in part, upon any criteria other
than solely by the continued employment of the holder.

The vested Company Equity Awards received under this _Section 3.3(b)_ shall
then be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 3.1(a)_, less such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law (the aggregate amount of such cash, together with the Option
Consideration, hereinafter referred to as the " _Option and Stock-Based
Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all Company Equity Awards and all
Company Stock Options, whether or not vested, shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically cease to exist, without any action on the part of any
parties, and each holder of a Company Equity Award or a Company Stock Option
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Option and Stock-Based Consideration.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt such resolutions and
take all actions as may reasonably be required to effectuate the actions
contemplated by this _Section 3.3_.

 

Section 3.4 Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company shall take
all actions reasonably necessary to provide that with respect to the Company
Amended and Restated Stock Purchase Plan (" _ESPP_ "): (i) no participant may
elect to participate in the ESPP after the date of this Agreement; (ii)
participants may not increase their payroll deduction percentages or purchase
elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement; (iii) no
Purchase Period (as defined in the ESPP) shall commence under the ESPP
following the date of this Agreement; (iv) each participants outstanding
right to purchase Shares under the ESPP shall terminate immediately following
the end of the Purchase Period in effect on the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ that all amounts allocated to each participants account under
the ESPP as of the Effective Date shall thereupon be used to purchase from
the Company whole Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time at the
applicable price under the ESPP for the then outstanding Purchase Period using
such date as the final purchase date for such Purchase Period; (v) as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the purchase of Shares in
accordance with the preceding clause (iv), return to participants the funds,
if any, that remain in the participants accounts after such purchase; and
(vi) the ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time so that
no further purchase rights shall be granted or exercised under the ESPP
thereafter.

Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

Section 4.1 Qualification, Organization, etc. The Company is a corporation

ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
organized, validly existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such
power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to (i) have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Offer or the Merger. The Company has
made available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement true and
complete copies of the Companys Articles of Incorporation and the Third
Amended and Restated Bylaws, each as amended through the date hereof and

" means any event, change, occurrence, development, circumstance or effect
(each, an " _Event_ ") that (x) is, or would reasonably be expected to be,
materially adverse to the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition
or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, but shall not include: an Event to the extent resulting from (A)
changes in general legal, tax, economic, political and/or regulatory

Agreement, or action taken, or failure to act, to which Parent has consented
in 

 



14  writing, (E) conditions arising out of acts of terrorism or sabotage, war

interpretation thereof, (G) any litigation arising from allegations of a
breach of fiduciary duty or other violation of applicable Law relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (H) any failure by the

or earning predictions for any period ending on or after the date of this
Agreement, in and of itself, or (I) a decline in the price or average daily
trading volume of the Shares on NASDAQ or any other trading market, in and of
itself;  _provided_ that any of the underlying causes of such changes or
failure in clauses (H) or (I) above shall not be excluded from the
determination of a Company Material Adverse Effect by virtue of such clauses;
and _provided_   _further_ that, nothwithstanding the foregoing, any matter
described in clauses (A), (B), (E) or (F) above shall not be excluded from the
determination of a Company Material Adverse Effect to the extent that such
matter disproportionately affects the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, as compared to other companies that conduct business in the industry
or industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries conduct business or
(y) would prevent the consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

Section 4.2 Subsidiaries. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is a legal

its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite and

ownership, leasing or operations of its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
organized, validly existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such
power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to (i) have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Offer or the Merger. _Section 4.2_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each of the Subsidiaries of the
Company as of the date hereof and its place of organization.  _Section 4.2_

Section 4.4 Corporate Authority Relative to This Agreement; No Violation.

 

(a) The Company has requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and, subject to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Board of Directors at a
duly held meeting has unanimously (i) determined that the Offer, the Merger

the Companys Articles of Incorporation), and declared it advisable to enter
into this Agreement; (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger (including under Article VII of the
Companys Articles of Incorporation); (iii) resolved to recommend that the
stockholders of the Company tender their Shares in the Offer or otherwise
approve the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Recommendation_ ") and directed

Meeting; (iv) rendered any Takeover Laws and the limitations on business
combinations contained in Section 780 of the MBCA and Article VI of the

corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming this
Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of Parent and Merger
Sub, constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,

 



17  reorganization, preference, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar
laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and by
general principles of equity regardless of whether enforcement is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions hereunder by the Company do not and
will not require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by,
filing with or notification to any federal, state, local or

other consents and/or notices set forth on _Section 4.4(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (collectively, clauses (i) through (vi), the " _Specified
Approvals_ "), and other than any consent, approval, authorization, permit,
action, filing or notification the failure of which to make or obtain would
not individually or in the aggregate, (A) reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, or (B) prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger. The approvals of the Board of
Directors referred to in _Section 4.4(a)_ constitute all necessary approvals
of the Board of Directors such that no restrictions of any Takeover Laws
apply to the Company with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Assuming compliance with the matters referenced in _Section 4.4(b)_,
receipt of the Specified Approvals and the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement, the consummation by Parent of the Offer and the consummation by the

documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) contravene or
conflict with in any material respect or constitute a material violation of
any provision of any Law binding upon or applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, or (iii)
result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation
or acceleration of any material obligation or to the loss of a material
benefit under any written or oral loan, guarantee of indebtedness or credit
agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement, contract,
instrument, permit, concession, franchise, right or license or other legally
binding arrangement (each, a " _Contract_ ") binding upon the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or result in the creation of any Lien (other than
Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii), any
such violation, conflict, default, termination, cancellation, acceleration,
right, loss or Lien that would not (A) individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (B)

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 4.5(a)_ of the Company Disclosure

registration statements, prospectuses, forms, reports, definitive proxy

Filing, as amended or supplemented prior to the date hereof, if applicable,
(i) as of its date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most
recent amendment or supplement thereto, complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not, at the time it was filed or
furnished (or became effective in the case of registration statements), or,
if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or
supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, none
of the Companys Subsidiaries is separately subject to the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act. As of the date hereof, the Company has not
received any written or, to the Companys knowledge, oral notice from the SEC
that any of the Company SEC Filings is the subject of any ongoing review by
the SEC and as of the date hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in comment letters from the SEC staff with respect to any Company SEC
Filing.

 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company SEC
Filings, as amended, supplemented or restated, if applicable, was prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto
and, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act) on a consistent basis throughout the
periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and each
of such consolidated financial statements, as amended, supplemented or
restated, if applicable, presented fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the
Company and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries as of the respective dates
thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case
of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments,
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not be material). The books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been maintained in all
material respects in accordance with GAAP (to the extent applicable).

(c) The Company has established and maintains a system of "internal control
over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
in accordance with GAAP. No significant deficiency, material weakness or
fraud that involves management or other employees was identified in
managements assessment of internal controls as of December 31, 2010.

 

(d) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) satisfy the requirement of Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act and are reasonably effective to ensure that all
material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is 

 



19  recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the
SEC to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act.

Section 4.6 No Undisclosed Liabilities . Except as and to the extent set forth
on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2011 included in the Companys annual report filed on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2011, including the notes thereto, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries of the Company has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
that would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a balance sheet
prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities or obligations (x)
contemplated by or under this Agreement or incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (y) incurred since December 31, 2011 in
the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent with past
practice, or (z) that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.7 Compliance with Law; Permits.

(a) Since January 1, 2008, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have been
in compliance with and have not been in default under or in violation of any
applicable federal, state, local or foreign or other law, statute, ordinance,
code, rule, regulation, judgment, order, award, injunction, decree or agency
requirement of any Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Laws_ " and each, a "
_Law_ "), except where such non-compliance, default or violation would not,
individually or in the aggregate, (i) reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or (ii) prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in possession of, and are in
compliance with, all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and
orders of any Governmental Entity necessary for the Company and its
Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets or to carry
on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the " _Company Permits_
"), except where the failure to have any Company Permit or be in compliance
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, and all such Company Permits are in full
force and effect, except where the failure to have any Company Permit or be
in compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) To the knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2008, neither the
Company, any Subsidiary, nor any other person acting on their behalf,
violated or made any unlawful payment under any anti-bribery, anti-corruption
or similar Laws and, since January 1, 2008, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has received any written notice from a Governmental Entity
that alleges any of the foregoing.

 



20 Section 4.8 Employee Matters.

 

(a) _Section 4.8_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of each material "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section
3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("
_ERISA_ "), and any other material pension, retirement, incentive, bonus,
employment, consulting, change in control, retention, severance, deferred
compensation, cafeteria, medical, disability, stock purchase or equity based
compensation plan, policy, program, practice, agreement, understanding or
arrangement (whether written or oral) providing compensation or other
benefits to any current or former director, officer, employee or consultant of
the Company or any Subsidiary (or to any dependent or beneficiary thereof),
which is maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the Company or
any Subsidiary, or under which the Company or any Subsidiary has any material
obligation or liability, whether actual or contingent (each a " _Company
Benefit Plan_ "). The Company has made available to Parent copies of all
material documents evidencing the terms of each Company Benefit Plan,
including all amendments thereto and all related trust documents, to the
extent applicable.

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects
in accordance with its terms and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the
Code. With respect to the Company Benefit Plans, no Event has occurred and,
to the knowledge of the Company, there exists no condition or set of
circumstances, in connection with which the Company could be subject to any
material liability (other than for routine benefit claims and appeals)
under the terms of, or with respect to, such Company Benefit Plans, ERISA,
the Code or any other Law applicable to such Company Benefit Plans.

(c) (i) Each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code has either received a favorable determination letter from
the IRS as to its qualified status or may rely upon an opinion letter for a
prototype plan and, to the Companys knowledge, no Event has occurred that
would reasonably be expected to result in a disqualification of any such
Company Benefit Plan, (ii) to the Companys knowledge, there has been no
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code, other than a transaction that is exempt under a statutory or
administrative exemption) with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that would
reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the Company, and
(iii) no suit, administrative proceeding, Action or other litigation has been
brought, or to the knowledge of the Company, is threatened against or with
respect to any such Company Benefit Plan, including any audit or inquiry by
the IRS or United States Department of Labor (other than routine benefit
claims and appeals).

 

(d) No Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer pension plan (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA) or other pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.
The Company has no liability under Title IV of ERISA, and no condition exists
that presents a material risk to the Company of incurring or being subject
(whether primarily, jointly or secondarily) to a material
liability thereunder. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate would incur
aggregate withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA in excess of $1.5
million if the Company and each ERISA Affiliate were to completely withdraw
(within the contemplation of Section 4203 of ERISA) from each multiemployer
plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) with respect to which the Company
or any ERISA Affiliate has an obligation to contribute, such liability to be 

 



21  determined based on a statement of withdrawal liability provided by such
multiemployer plans trustee to the Company or an ERISA Affiliate with respect
to an assumed complete withdrawal in 2012 or by a mutually agreed upon
independent actuary based on the latest available information updated based on
reasonable and prudent assumptions made by such actuary. For this purpose,
"ERISA Affiliate" means any person who, together with the Company or any
Subsidiary, is treated as a single employer for purposes of Section 414(b),
(c), (m) or (o) of the Code.

(e) The consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, alone or in combination with a termination of any employee,
officer, director, stockholder or other service provider of the Company or
its Subsidiaries (whether current, former or retired) or their beneficiaries,
will not give rise to any material liability under any Company Benefit Plan,
or accelerate the time of payment or funding or vesting or increase the amount
of compensation or benefits due to any such person. No amount that could be
received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property), as a result
of the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
by any employee, officer, director, stockholder or other service provider of
the Company or its Subsidiaries who is a disqualified individual (as such term
is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any Company
Benefit Plan would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or
would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any indemnity obligation on or after
the Acceptance Time for any Taxes imposed under Section 4999 or 409A of the
Code.

(f) Except as required by Law, no Company Benefit Plan or any other
arrangement provides any post-employment medical, welfare or life insurance
benefit coverage.

(g) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, with respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is mandated by
a government other than the United States or subject to the Laws of a
jurisdiction outside of the United States (each, a " _Foreign Company Benefit
Plan_ "), the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Company
Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Company Benefit
Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign
Company Benefit Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient
to procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the date of
this Agreement, with respect to all current and former participants in such
Foreign Company Benefit Plan according to the actuarial assumptions and
valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such
Foreign Company Benefit Plan, and no transaction contemplated by this
Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than
such benefit obligations.

(h) There is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened (i)
strike, (ii) work stoppage, or (iii) other labor dispute against the Company
that may interfere with the business activities of the Company, except in the
case of (iii) where such dispute would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in _Section 4.8(h)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is party to any collective bargaining agreement or collective
bargaining relationship with any labor organization.

 



22 Section 4.9 Absence of Certain Changes or Events . Since December 31, 2011,
except as contemplated by this Agreement, the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has been conducted, in all material respects, in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice, and there has not been (a) any Company
Material Adverse Effect or (b) any action taken by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries during the period from January 1, 2012 through the date of this
Agreement that, if taken during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach of _Section 6.1_
hereof.

Section 4.10 Investigations; Litigation . As of the date of this Agreement,

suits, inquiries, investigations or proceedings pending (or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened) against or affecting the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties at law or in equity
before, or against any present or former officer, director or, to the
knowledge of the Company, employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in such individuals capacity as such, that, and there are no orders,
judgments or decrees of, or before, any Governmental Entity, in each case
which would, individually or in the aggregate, (i) reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

Section 4.11 Schedule 14D-9, Offer Documents; Proxy Statement . None of the
information supplied or to be supplied in writing by or on behalf of the
Company or any Affiliate of the Company for inclusion in the Offer Documents
and the Proxy Statement will, at the times such documents are filed with the
SEC and mailed to the stockholders of the Company, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Schedule 14D-9
and the Proxy Statement will not, at the time the Schedule 14D-9 or Proxy
Statement is filed with the SEC and at all times prior to the purchase of
Shares by Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer or the completion of the Merger,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty
is made by the Company with respect to information supplied in writing by
Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives which is contained in the Schedule
14D-9. The Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement will, at the time the
Schedule 14D-9 or Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC, at the time it is
mailed to the stockholders of the Company, and at the time any amendment or
supplement thereto is filed with the SEC, comply as to form and substance in

all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing,
qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Offer or the Closing or prevent or materially impair the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to satisfy the Tender Offer conditions or the
conditions precedent to the Merger, to obtain financing for the

 



28  Offer or the Merger, or to consummate the Merger, the Offer and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a " _Parent Material Adverse

Section 5.2 Corporate Authority Relative to This Agreement; No Violation.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly authorized by the boards of directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub
and by Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and, except for the

and Regulatory Affairs, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent
or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming this Agreement constitutes
the valid and binding agreement of the Company, this Agreement constitutes
the valid and binding agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against
each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,

equity regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this

permit of, action by, filing with or notification to any Governmental Entity

_Parent Approvals_ "), and other than any consent, approval, authorization,
permit, action, filing or notification the failure of which to make or obtain
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

(c) Assuming compliance with the matters referenced in _Section 5.2(b)_ and
receipt of the Parent Approvals, the execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do
not and will not (i) contravene or conflict with the organizational or
governing documents of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) contravene or conflict with
or constitute a violation of any provision of any Law binding upon or
applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties or
assets, or (iii) result in any violation of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of

 



29  termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation or to
the loss of a material benefit under any Contract binding upon Parent or
Merger Sub or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens)
upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub, other than, in
the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this subsection, any such violation,
conflict, default, termination, cancellation, acceleration, right, loss or
Lien that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.3 Investigations; Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement,
there is no investigation or review pending (or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened) by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries which would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, and there are no Actions, suits,
inquiries, investigations or proceedings pending (or, to Parents knowledge,
threatened) against or affecting Parent or its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective properties at law or in equity before, and there are no orders,
judgments or decrees of, or before, any Governmental Entity, in each case
which would have, individually or in the aggregate a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 5.4 Offer Documents, Schedule 14D-9.

(a) None of the Offer Documents will, at the time such documents are filed
with the SEC or such documents are mailed to the stockholders of the Company
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Offer Documents will, at the time such documents are filed
with the SEC and, at the time they are mailed to the stockholders of the
Company, and at the time any amendment or supplement thereto is filed with the
SEC, comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 

(b) None of the information to be supplied in writing by Parent, Merger Sub or
any Representative of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9 or the Proxy Statement, if any, will, at the time such document is filed
with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

 

Section 5.5 Availability of Funds. Parent has the financial ability and will
have available at Closing sufficient cash in immediately available funds to
pay the Merger Consideration and all costs, fees and expenses necessary to
consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Parent expressly
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereunder
is not subject to any condition or contingency with respect to financing.

Section 5.6 Solvency. Immediately following the Effective Time, and after
giving effect to any change in the assets and liabilities of the Surviving
Corporation as a result of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent. No transfer of
property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in

 



30  connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future
creditors of the Surviving Corporation. For purposes of this Agreement "
_Solvent_ " when used with respect to the Surviving Corporation, means that,
immediately following the Effective Time, (a)(i) the fair value of the assets
of the Surviving Corporation will exceed the amount of all liabilities,
contingent or otherwise, of the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) the amount of
the Present Fair Salable Value of its assets will, as of such time, exceed the
probable value of all of its debts and liabilities on a consolidated basis,
contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become absolute and
matured, (b) the Surviving Corporation will not have, as of such time, an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the business in which it is engaged
or will be engaged and (c) the Surviving Corporation will be able to pay its
Debts as they become absolute and mature. The term " _Solvency_ " shall have
its correlative meaning. For purposes of the definition of " _Solvent_ ,"(a)
" _Debt_ " means liability on a " _Claim_ ;" and (b) " _Claim_ " means any
right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment,
liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured. " _Present Fair Salable
Value_ " means the amount that may be realized if the aggregate assets of the
Surviving Corporation (including goodwill) are sold as an entirety with
reasonable promptness in an arms-length transaction under present conditions
for the sale of comparable business enterprises.

Section 5.7 Ownership of Company Common Stock. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is, or ever has been, an "interested shareholder" of the Company
as defined in Section 778(2) of the MBCA or as defined in Article VI of the
Companys Articles of Incorporation. None of Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries owns (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record) or is a
party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of
acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of, in each case, any shares of
capital stock of the Company (other than as contemplated by this Agreement).

Section 5.8 Capitalization of Merger Sub. The authorized capital stock of
Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be,
owned by Parent or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. The common stock of
Merger Sub is the only class of authorized stock of Merger Sub entitled to
vote in matters submitted to stockholders. Merger Sub has outstanding no
option, warrant, right, or any other agreement pursuant to which any person
other than Parent, or a wholly-owned Subsidiary or Parent, may acquire any
equity security of Merger Sub. Merger Sub has not conducted any business
prior to the date hereof and has, and prior to the Effective Time will have,
no assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident
to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.9 No Vote of Parent Stockholders. No vote of the stockholders of
Parent or the holders of any other securities of Parent (equity or otherwise)
is required by any applicable Law, the articles of incorporation or bylaws or
other equivalent organizational documents of Parent or the applicable rules
of any exchange on which securities of Parent are traded, in order for Parent
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

Each Parent SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented if applicable, (i) as of
its date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent
amendment or supplement thereto, complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and (ii) did not, at the time it was filed (or became effective in the case of
registration statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of
the date of this Agreement, none of Parents Subsidiaries is separately
subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained in the Parent SEC
Filings, as amended, supplemented or restated, if applicable, was prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto
and, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act) on a consistent basis throughout the
periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and each
of such consolidated financial statements, as amended, supplemented or
restated, if applicable, presented fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of
Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof
and for the respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments
which would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect).

 

Section 5.11 Management Arrangements. As of the date hereof, none of Parent,
Merger Sub nor any of their Affiliates has entered into any contract,
agreement, arrangement or understanding with any of the officers or directors
of the Company that is currently in effect or that would become effective in
the future (upon consummation of the Merger or otherwise) and have not
been disclosed.

Section 5.12 Finders or Brokers. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has employed or
has any Contract with any investment banker, financial advisor, broker or
finder in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement who

consummation of the Merger for which the Company would have any liability
prior to Closing.

Section 5.13 Limitation on Warranties. In entering into this
Agreement, except as expressly provided herein, each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that it has not been induced by and has not relied
upon any representations, warranties or statements, whether express or
implied, made by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective directors, officers, shareholders, employees, Affiliates, agents,
advisors or Representatives that are not expressly set forth in this
Agreement, whether or not such representations, warranties or statements were

Section 6.2 Access.

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, the Company shall afford to
Parent and its Representatives and Parents financing sources and their
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, throughout
the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination
Date, to the Companys and its Subsidiaries properties, Contracts, employees,
commitments, books and records and, jointly with an employee of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, customers and suppliers, and, during such period, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish, promptly to
Parent and its Representatives and Parents financing sources and
their Representatives all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as may reasonably be requested. The foregoing notwithstanding, the
Company shall not be required to afford such access or furnish such
information if it would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a violation of the confidentiality
provisions of any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party, would cause the loss of attorney-client or work product privilege
(so long as the Company has reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit such
inspection of or to disclose such information on a basis that does not waive
such privilege with respect thereto) or would constitute a violation of any
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that information shall be disclosed
subject to execution of a joint defense agreement in customary form, to
external counsel for Parent to the extent reasonably required for the purpose
of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws. No information or knowledge
obtained by Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.2(a)_ shall affect any
representation or warranty of the Company.

 

(b) Parent hereby agrees that all information provided to it or its
Representatives pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_ shall be deemed to be
Evaluation Material, as such term is used in, and shall be treated in
accordance with, the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.3 No Solicitation.

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company agrees
that it shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries not to and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, take any action to (i) solicit, initiate or 

 



37  facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal, (ii) participate
in any way in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any non-public
information to, any person in connection with or for the purpose of
facilitating any Alternative Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal, (iii) other
than the Offer and the Merger, approve or recommend any Alternative Proposal,
(iv) enter into any agreement or letter of intent with respect to any
Alternative Proposal, (v) grant any waiver, amendment or release under
any standstill agreement or Takeover Laws for the purpose of allowing a third
party to make an Alternative Proposal, or (vi) resolve or propose to do any of
the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives and
Subsidiaries to, immediately cease all discussions with any person with
respect to any Alternative Proposal, and promptly deliver a written notice to
any person that entered into a confidentiality agreement in anticipation of
potentially making an Alternative Proposal requesting the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_, if the
Company has received an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Alternative Proposal
prior to the Acceptance Time from a third party (which Alternative Proposal
does not arise out of any breach of this  _Section 6.3_) and the Board of
Directors determines, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal advisor, that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal,
the Company may (i) participate in any discussions or negotiations with such
person, or (ii) provide any non-public information to such person only if,
prior to providing such information, the Company has received from such
person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_ that the
Company shall promptly make available to Parent any information that is
provided to such person. An " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "
means a confidentiality and standstill agreement with terms no less favorable
to the Company in any substantive respect than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) The Company agrees that it shall promptly (and, in any event, within one
(1) Business Day of the Companys knowledge of any such event) notify Parent
if (x) any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Alternative
Proposal are received by, (y) any non-public information is requested from or
(z) any discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or Representative indicating the identity of the
person making such inquiry, offer or proposal and the material terms and
conditions thereof and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
prompt basis, of any material developments or modifications to the terms of
any such inquiries, proposals or offers and the status of any such material
discussions.

(d) Except as expressly provided in _Section 6.3(e)_, at any time after the
date hereof, the Board of Directors shall not (i) effect a Change of
Recommendation or (ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to enter into any definitive Contract with respect to an Alternative Proposal
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with
_Section 6.3(b)_) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time,

 



38 (i) if the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Alternative Proposal
(which Alternative Proposal did not arise out of any breach of this _Section
6.3_) from any person that has not been withdrawn and that the Board of
Directors concludes constitutes a Superior Proposal, (x) the Board
of Directors may effect a Change of Recommendation with respect to such
Superior Proposal, or (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement to enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, only if: (A) the Board of Directors concludes (after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal advisors) that the failure of
the Board of Directors to do so would be inconsistent with the exercise of the
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Law; (B) the Company shall have complied with all of its
obligations under this _Section 6.3_; (C) the Company shall have provided
prior written notice (a " _Determination Notice_ ") to Parent at least three
(3) calendar days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), to the effect that the
Board of Directors has concluded constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Board
of Directors has determined to effect a Change of Recommendation and/or to
terminate this Agreement, which notice shall specify the identity of the
person making the Superior Proposal, the material terms thereof and copies of
all relevant documents relating to such Superior Proposal; (D) prior to
effecting such Change of Recommendation or termination, the Company shall, and
shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period,
negotiate (if Parent has notified the Company that it desires to negotiate)
with Parent and its Representatives in good faith to make such adjustments in
the terms of this Agreement, so that such Alternative Proposal would cease to
constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that, in the event of any material
revisions to the Alternative Proposal that the Board of Directors has
determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver
a new Determination Notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of
this _Section 6.3_ (including _Section 6.3(e)_) with respect to such new
Determination Notice and the revised Superior Proposal contemplated thereby;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Notice Period with respect to any new
Determination Notice delivered pursuant to the immediately preceding proviso
shall be reduced from three (3) calendar days to two (2) calendar days; and
(E) in the case of any action contemplated by clause (y) of this _Section
6.3(e)_, the Company shall concurrently terminate this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 8.1(g)_; or

(ii) other than in connection with an Alternative Proposal, the Board of
Directors may take the actions specified in clauses (i), (iii)(B) or (v) in
the definition of Change of Recommendation (" _Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation_ ") in response to an Intervening Event if the Board of
Directors shall have determined, after consultation with outside counsel, that
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the exercise of the fiduciary
duties of the Board of Directors to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law, only if: (A) the Company shall have provided a Determination
Notice to Parent for at least the Notice Period to the effect that the Board
of Directors has determined to effect an Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation, which notice shall specify the Intervening Event in reasonable
detail (and provided that any material change to the facts and circumstances
relating to such Intervening Event Change of Recommendation shall require a
new notice and a new Notice Period); (B) prior to effecting such Intervening
Event Change of Recommendation, the Company shall, during 

 



39  the Notice Period, negotiate (if Parent has notified the Company that it
desires to negotiate) with Parent to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that such Intervening Event no
longer necessitates such Intervening Event Change of Recommendation; and (C)
at or following the end of such Notice Period, the Board of Directors
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors,
that such Intervening Event continues to necessitate an Intervening Event
Change of Recommendation (in each case taking into account any revisions to
this Agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent).

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Board of
Directors from (i) disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of Directors has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal advisors) that the failure to do so would violate applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure relating to an
Alternative Proposal (other than a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act)
shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the Board of Directors
reaffirms the Recommendation in such disclosure.

 

(g) No Change of Recommendation or Intervening Event Change of Recommendation
shall change the approval of the Board of Directors for purposes of causing
any Takeover Laws to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Support Agreements. The Company agrees that if any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives takes any action which, if taken by
the Company, would constitute a breach of this _Section 6.3_, the Company
shall be deemed to be in breach of this _Section 6.3_.

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any
inquiry, proposal or offer made by any person (other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries) relating to (i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation or similar transaction involving the Company, (ii) any tender
offer or exchange offer or other transaction that, if consummated, would
result in any person beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of any
class of outstanding equity interests in the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (by vote or by value), (iii) the acquisition or licensing by any
person of assets representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
consolidated assets, net revenues or net income of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (including equity interests of its
Subsidiaries), or (iv) the acquisition by any person of fifteen (15%) or more
of the total voting power or of any class of equity interests of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

(i) As used in this Agreement " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a _bona fide_
written Alternative Proposal (with all of the percentages included in the
definition of Alternative Proposal increased to 50%) not arising out of any
violation of _Section 6.3_, which the Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, is more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Companys
stockholders (in their capacity as such) than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (after taking into account any revisions offered by Parent to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby).

 



40 Section 6.4 Filings; Other Actions.

 

(a) If the Company Stockholder Approval is required under the MBCA, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the consummation or expiration
of the Offer, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy
statement (including the letter to stockholders, notice of meeting and form of
proxy, the " _Proxy Statement_ "), which shall, subject to  _Section 6.3_,
include the Recommendation.

(b) Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Proxy Statement (including each amendment or supplement
thereto) before it is filed with the SEC. The Company shall provide Parent and
Merger Sub (in writing, if written), and consult with Parent and Merger Sub
regarding, any comments (written or oral) the Company or its counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement as
promptly as practicable after receipt of such comments. Parent and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written and oral
comments and proposed responses. The Company and Parent shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect
to all comments received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company
shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed promptly after the SEC
staff advises it that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company
may commence mailing the Proxy Statement. Subject to applicable Law, the
Company and Parent (with respect to itself and Merger Sub) shall each, upon
request of the other, furnish the other with all information concerning
itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by
or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
any third party and/or Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, if the Company
Stockholder Approval is required under the MBCA, the Company shall (i) take
all action necessary in accordance with the MBCA and its Articles of
Incorporation and Third Amended and Restated Bylaws to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of voting
upon the approval and adoption of this Agreement, including the Merger (the "
_Company Stockholders Meeting_ "), as soon as practicable following the
Acceptance Time, and (ii) subject to a Change of Recommendation, use all
reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the forgoing, if a Short Form
Merger may be effected in accordance with _Section 2.8_ and Section 711 of
the MBCA, the parties hereto agree to take all necessary and appropriate
action to cause the Merger to become effective on the dates specified in
_Section 2.2_ without a Company Stockholders Meeting, in accordance with
Section 711 of the MBCA. From and after the Acceptance Time, unless this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_,
the Company shall submit this Agreement to its stockholders at the Company
Stockholders Meeting even if the Board of Directors shall have effected a
Change of Recommendation or Intervening Event Change of Recommendation.

 



41 Section 6.5 Employee Matters.

 

(a) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent (collectively, " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") in which any
director, officer, employee, or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the " _Company Employees_ ") or the beneficiaries and dependents
thereof is otherwise eligible to participate effective as of the Effective
Time, to the extent permitted under Parent Benefit Plans and applicable Law,
(i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any Parent Benefit Plans (such
plans, collectively, the " _New Plans_ ") to the extent coverage under such
New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
before the Effective Time, (ii) all service of the Company Employees with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, will be recognized for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, accruals, and
entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant under the New
Plans, other than benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan, to
the extent such service was recognized or would have been recognized under a
comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participates
or is eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; (iii)
Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions, waiting periods and
actively-at-work requirements of each New Plan to be waived or satisfied for
each Company Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent
currently applicable to such persons and waived or satisfied under the
comparable Company Benefit Plan for the year in which the Effective Time
occurs; (iv) Parent shall provide each Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to becoming eligible to participate in such New Plan, to the same extent such
credit was given or would have been given under the comparable Company
Benefit Plan, in satisfying any applicable deductible or annual maximum out-
of-pocket or similar requirements under such New Plan; and (v) Parent shall
apply any increase in the Company Employees portion of the premium cost,
deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs no earlier than the
first day of the first plan year beginning after the Effective Time of either
the comparable Company Benefit Plan or the New Plan (as applicable). Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required
to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, any
dispositions of Shares (including derivative securities with respect to
Shares) that are treated as dispositions under such rule and result from the
Merger or other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, Parent acknowledges that the consummation of
the Merger shall constitute a "Change in Control" as defined in the Company
Benefit Plans set forth on _Section 6.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

(c) During the period ending December 31, 2012, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, will provide, and Parent will cause the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to provide to the Company Employees
(i) a base salary or regular hourly wage, as applicable, that is not less than
the base salary or regular hourly wage provided to such Company Employee by
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cash bonus
opportunity, sales and service incentive award cash compensation opportunity
provided to such Company Employee by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time

 



42  and (iii) employee benefits (other than defined benefit pension benefits,
equity-based benefits, and as otherwise provided in (i) and (ii) above) that
are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to such persons
and their beneficiaries and dependents under the Company Benefit Plans,
programs and arrangements of the Company in effect on the date hereof, but in
no event less than those provided to those generally offered from time to
time to similarly situated employees of Parent.

(d) The parties agree that all provisions in this _Section 6.5_ are included
for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and that nothing in this
Agreement, whether express or implied, shall (i) constitute an amendment to
any Parent Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Plan or any other applicable
employee benefit arrangement, (ii) create any third party beneficiary rights
(x) in any other person, or (y) to continued employment with Parent, Company
or any of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries, or (iii) reduce or eliminate any
accrued or vested benefit under any Company Benefit Plan or any rights or
benefits to which any individual may be entitled pursuant to the terms of any
contract or agreement between such individual and the Company or any
Subsidiary.

Section 6.6 Efforts.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take
promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to
be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the
Offer and to consummate and make effective the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable,
including (i) the preparing and obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals and expirations or
terminations of waiting periods, including the Specified Approvals and the
Parent Approvals, from Governmental Entities and the preparing and making of
all necessary registrations, filings and notices and the taking of all steps
as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance or waiver from, or to
avoid an Action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining
of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii)
satisfying the Tender Offer Conditions and the conditions to the consummation
of the Merger set forth in Article VII, (iv) the defending of any lawsuits or
other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Offer and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (v) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay
prior to the Effective Time any material fee, penalty or other consideration
to any third party for any consents or approvals required for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any contract or
agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without
limiting the foregoing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i)
promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days, after the date
hereof, file any and all required Notification and Report forms under the HSR
Act with respect to the Offer, Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act,
(ii) use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (x)
determining whether any filings are required to be

 



43  made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances,

(c) Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental Entity,
the Company and Parent shall keep each other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated thereby,
including promptly (i) notifying the other party of any communication from any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or
inquiry concerning this Agreement, (ii) furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions. The Company and
Parent shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with, and incorporate the other partys reasonable comments with
respect to, any proposed written communication to any Governmental Entity
and/or any third party. Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by
telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed
transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this  _Section 6.6_, if any administrative or judicial Action
or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Law, each of the Company and Parent shall
cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such Action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

Section 6.7 Takeover Statute. If any Takeover Law shall become applicable to
the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company and Parent and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and
take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press
release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance of such
press release or other public statement or comment relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such press
release or other public statement or comment prior to such consultation and

 



44  without the other partys prior written consent, except as may be required
by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange or automated quotation system, in which case the
party required to make the release shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release in advance of
such issuance. Parent and the Company agree to issue a joint press release
announcing this Agreement.

Section 6.9 Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(a) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
agrees to, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold
harmless all past and present directors or officers of the Company (" _Covered
Persons_ ") to the same extent such persons are indemnified as of the date of
this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Companys Articles of
Incorporation, Third Amended and Restated Bylaws and indemnification
agreements set forth on _Section 6.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement with any Covered Persons
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
, _however_ , that Parent agrees to, and to cause the Surviving Corporation
to, indemnify and hold harmless such persons to the fullest extent permitted
by Law for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each Covered Person shall be entitled to advancement of all reasonable and
documented expenses incurred in the defense of any Claim, Action, suit,
proceeding or investigation with respect to any matters subject to
indemnification hereunder, _provided_ that any person to whom expenses are
advanced undertakes to repay such advanced expenses if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Claim, Action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective
Time) is made against any Covered Person with respect to matters subject to
indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall continue in effect
until the final disposition of such Claim, Action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.

(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons than are currently
set forth in the Companys Articles of Incorporation and Third Amended and
Restated Bylaws. Any indemnification agreements with Covered Person in
existence on the date of this Agreement set forth on _Section 6.9(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in
the Merger, without any further action, and shall survive the Merger and
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 

(c) For six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
provide to the Companys current directors and officers an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage with respect to any matter
claimed against such person by reason of him or her serving in such capacity
on terms for events occurring before the Effective Time that is no
less favorable than the Companys existing policies in effect as of April 4,
2012 (the " _Existing Policies_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an 

 



45  annual premium for such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (which annual premium
is set forth in _Section 6.9(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule), but in
such case Parent shall maintain policies of directors and officers insurance
and indemnification as closely approximating the terms of the Existing
Policies that are obtainable for an aggregate annual premium not to exceed

Policies for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to Claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time,
including, without limitation, in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the annual premium for such insurance policies shall not exceed 300% of
the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement. If such

respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving
corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

 

(f) From and after the Acceptance Time, the obligations under this _Section
6.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to affect
adversely any Covered Person without the consent of such affected Covered
Person. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the consummation
of the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each of the Covered Persons and their respective
successors, heirs and personal representatives.

understanding entered into by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company on or
after the date hereof with any of its officers, directors or
employees pursuant to which consideration is paid to such officer, director
or employee to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under

harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

consult with one another, to the fullest extent possible, in connection with
any pending or threatened stockholder litigation related to the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ that, subject to _Section 6.11_ of the

unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed). Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall give consideration to Parents advice with
respect to such litigation.

certificate, in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, duly executed by the
Company certifying that the Shares are not "U.S. real property interests"
within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code, and shall provide notice of
such certificate to the IRS in accordance with Section 1.897-2(h).

 

Section 6.13 Control of Operations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Companys operations prior to the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the
Effective Time. Prior to the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the Effective
Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

(f) Each party acknowledges that this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of

circumstances in which such Termination Fee is payable, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement (other than as set forth in this _Section
8.2(f))_, in the event that any Termination Fee is paid pursuant to _Sections
8.2(b)_ , _8.2(c)_ or _8.2(d)_ , Parents right to receive payment of

of such amount, none of the Company, any of it Subsidiaries or any of their
respective former or current officers or directors shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing contained in this _Section 8.2(f)_

material breach of this Agreement or (ii) affect any partys rights to
specific performance, including as set forth in _Section 9.5(b)_.

[Signature Page to the Agreement and Plan of Merger] Annex I

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

_Conditions to the Offer_. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer,
but subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule
14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act (relating to Parents obligation
to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after termination or withdrawal
of the Offer), neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to accept for
payment, and shall not be obligated to pay for any validly tendered and not
withdrawn Shares or may, but only to the extent expressly permitted by this
Agreement, delay the acceptance for payment of any tendered Shares if (i) the
Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied, (ii) any applicable waiting
period or approval under the HSR Act, the antitrust Laws of Germany and
Austria and any other material applicable foreign antitrust Law shall not
have expired or been earlier terminated or obtained, or (iii) at any time
after the date of the Agreement and before the expiration of the Offer, any of
the following events shall occur and be continuing:

(a) a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall
have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law, order,
decree, judgment, injunction or other ruling, in any case which is in effect
and which prevents, prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger
or the Offer;

 

(b) (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
this Agreement (other than the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 4.3(a)_ , _4.3(b)_ and _4.3(c)_ ) (disregarding all qualifications
and exceptions contained therein regarding knowledge, materiality or Company
Material Adverse Effect) shall not be true and correct in each case at and as
of the date of the Agreement or at and as of the Expiration Date as though
made at and as of the Expiration Date (except to the extent expressly made as
of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), except where the failure
of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect; or (ii) the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in _Sections 4.3(a)_ , _4.3(b)_ and _4.3(c)_ shall not be
true and correct in all respects as of the date of the Agreement or as of the
Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date, except where
the failure to be so true and correct has not resulted and would not result
in the Company, Parent and their Affiliates making payments (in the aggregate)
with respect to any equity interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
greater than a  _de minimis_ amount;

(c) the Company shall not have in all material respects performed all
obligations and complied with all covenants required by the Agreement to be
performed or complied with by it prior to the Expiration Date and such failure
to perform shall not have been cured prior to the Expiration Date;

 

(d) there shall have occurred any Events that have had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect; (e) Parent shall not have received a certificate signed on behalf of
the Company by the chief executive officer of the Company to the effect that
none of the conditions in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this Annex I shall
have occurred and be continuing; or

 

(f) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and
may be asserted by Parent and Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to such condition, in whole or in part at any applicable time or
from time to time in its sole discretion prior to the expiration of the Offer,
and all conditions, solely to the extent permitted by _Section 1.1_ of the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 10, 2012, among Danaher
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Termessos Acquisition
Corp., a Michigan corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and X-Rite, Incorporated, a Michigan corporation
(the " _Agreement_ "), may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub, in their sole
discretion, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time.
The failure by Parent and Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and
from time to time. 

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex I_ shall have the respective meanings
ascribed thereto in the Agreement.
