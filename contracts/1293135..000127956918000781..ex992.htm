and reasonable and is approved by the Court as well as the following or

Securities Act of 1933,_ as amended, from the registration requirements
otherwise imposed by that act regarding the distribution of securities of
Vermilion pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement"; 
---|---|---

the hearing of the Court for the Final Order and providing them with adequate
information to enable such Person to exercise such right; 
---|---|--- 
   | (f)| each Person to whom Vermilion Shares shall be issued pursuant to
the Arrangement shall be advised that such Vermilion Shares have not been
registered under the U.S. Securities Act and shall be issued by Vermilion in
reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act and,
in the case of Persons who are as of (or within 90 days of) the Effective Time
affiliates (within the meaning of U.S. Securities Laws) of Vermilion, shall
be subject to certain restrictions on resale under the U.S. Securities
Laws, including Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act; and

---|---|--- 
   | (e)| in connection with the Competition Act Approval:

   | (i)| Vermilion and Spartan shall as promptly as reasonably practicable
duly file with the Competition Bureau, a request for an ARC under Section 102

with any third parties other than Vermilion, initiated on or before the date

approval of the Arrangement by the Spartan Board or the recommendation of the
Spartan Board that the Spartan Shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement
Resolution at the Spartan Meeting; 
---|---|--- 
   | (iii)| encourage or participate in any negotiations or discussions

properties, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) in
connection with, or in furtherance of, an actual or potential Acquisition
Proposal; 
---|---|--- 
     

33 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

    | (iv)| accept, recommend, approve, agree to endorse or publicly
propose to accept, recommend, approve, agree to endorse or enter into an
agreement to implement any Acquisition Proposal or otherwise take any action
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; 
---|---|--- 
   



  

provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision hereof but
subject to Section 3.4(d), Spartan and its Representatives may, prior to
obtaining the approval of the Arrangement Resolution by Spartan Shareholders
at the Spartan Meeting, enter into or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish information or provide access to, any person in
response to an Acquisition Proposal by such person if and only to the extent
that:

   | (v)| such Acquisition Proposal is an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal received by Spartan from such person other than as a
result from a breach of this Section 3.4 and the Spartan Board has determined,
in good faith, after consultation with the Spartan Financial Advisor and
outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal, if completed in
accordance with its terms, would constitute a Superior Proposal; and 
---|---|--- 
   | (vi)| (A) Spartan shall have complied with and continue to be
compliance with all other requirements of this Section 3.4 and the Person
making the Acquisition Proposal shall not have been restricted from making
such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to existing confidentiality, non-
disclosure or standstill agreement or similar restriction; (B) the Spartan
Board, after consultation with the Spartan Financial Advisor and outside
legal counsel, determines in good faith that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under all Applicable Laws; and
(C) prior to providing any information or data to such person in connection
with such Acquisition Proposal: (1) Spartan notifies Vermilion of the
determination by the Spartan Board that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal; and (2) the Spartan Board receives from such person an
executed confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less
favourable to Spartan than those contained in the Spartan Confidentiality
Agreement and Vermilion is provided promptly with a copy of such
confidentiality agreement (provided that such confidentiality agreement may
not grant such Person the exclusive right to negotiate with Spartan and may
not restrict Spartan from complying with this Section) and any information
that was provided to such person which was not previously provided to
Vermilion; 
---|---|--- 
   | (c)| Spartan shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of
receipt by Spartan) notify Vermilion, first orally and then in writing, of
any proposal, inquiry or offer (or any amendment thereto) constituting an
actual or potential Acquisition Proposal, in each case received after the
date hereof by Spartan or any of its Representatives, or any amendments
to the foregoing, any request for discussions or negotiations, or any request
for non-public information relating to Spartan or any of its subsidiaries in
connection with any proposal, inquiry, offer (or any amendment thereto) or
request that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to constitute or
lead to an actual or potential Acquisition Proposal or for access to the
properties or facilities, personnel, books or records of Spartan or any of
its subsidiaries by any person that informs Spartan or any of
its Representative or otherwise indicates that it is considering making, or
has made, an Acquisition Proposal and any amendment thereto; and Spartan
shall provide to Vermilion a copy of such Acquisition Proposal and shall
provide the identity of the person making any such Acquisition Proposal
together with such other details of the Acquisition Proposal or request for
non-public information as Vermilion may reasonably request. Spartan shall
keep Vermilion regularly and promptly informed of the status of and any
change to the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal in writing and
shall provide to Vermilion copies of all material or
substantive correspondence with respect to such Acquisition Proposal or
proposal, inquiry, offer or request if in writing or electronic form, and if
not in writing or electronic form, a description of the material terms of such
correspondence. 
---|---|--- 
    

34 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  



   | (d)| Spartan shall not accept, approve or recommend, nor enter into
any agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement permitted by this Section 3.4), unless: 
---|---|--- 
   | (i)| the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the
Person making the Acquisition Proposal shall not have been restricted from
making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to existing confidentiality, non-
disclosure or standstill agreement or similar restriction 
---|---|--- 
   | (ii)| Spartan has complied with and continues to be in compliance with
its obligations in Section 3.4; 
---|---|--- 
   | (iii)| Spartan has provided Vermilion with (A) notice in writing that
the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and, in connection
therewith, the Spartan Board has made the determinations contemplated in the
definition of "Superior Proposal", (B) all documentation related to and
detailing the Superior Proposal (including a copy of any confidentiality and
standstill agreement between Spartan and the person making the Superior
Proposal, if not previously delivered), as well as all supporting materials,
including any financing documents supplied to Spartan of its Representatives
in connection therewith, and (C) written notice regarding the value and
financial terms that the Spartan Board, in consultation with the Spartan
Financial Advisor, has determined should be ascribed to any non-cash
consideration offered under such Superior Proposal, in each case, at least
four (4) Business Days prior to the time at which the Spartan Board proposes
to accept, approve, recommend or enter into any agreement relating to such
Superior Proposal; 
---|---|--- 
   | (iv)| four (4) Business Days shall have elapsed from the later of the
date Vermilion received the notice, documentation and other materials
referred to in Section 3.4(d)(iii) from Spartan in respect of the Acquisition
Proposal and the date on which Vermilion received notice of Spartan's
proposed determination to accept, approve, recommend or to enter into any
agreement relating to such Superior Proposal, and, if Vermilion has proposed
to amend the terms of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and the
Arrangement in accordance with Section 3.4(e), the Spartan Board (after
receiving advice from the Spartan Financial Advisor and outside legal
counsel) shall have determined in good faith that the Acquisition Proposal is
a Superior Proposal compared to the proposed amendment to the terms of this
Agreement and the Arrangement proposed by Vermilion 
---|---|--- 
   | (v)| Spartan concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(ii); 
---|---|--- 
   | (vi)| Spartan concurrently will have delivered to Vermilion written
confirmation that Spartan or the Spartan Board has accepted, approved or
recommended, or entered into such agreement relating to, the Acquisition
Proposal; and 
---|---|--- 
    

35 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  



   | (vii)| Spartan has previously paid, or concurrently pays, to Vermilion
the Vermilion Damages Fee. 
---|---|--- 
   | (e)| During the periods referred to in Section 3.4(d)(iii) and Section
3.4(d)(iv), Vermilion shall have the opportunity, but not the obligation, to
propose to amend the terms of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement and the Arrangement and Spartan shall, and shall cause and its
counsel and other advisors to, co-operate with Vermilion with
respect thereto, including negotiating with Vermilion and their counsel and
other advisors to enable Vermilion to propose such adjustments to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Arrangement as Vermilion deems
appropriate and as would enable Spartan to proceed with the Arrangement and
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement on such adjusted terms. The
Spartan Board shall review any proposal by Vermilion to amend the terms of
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and the Arrangement in
order to determine, in good faith in the exercise of its fiduciary duties,
whether Vermilion's proposal to amend the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Arrangement would result in the Acquisition Proposal not
being a Superior Proposal compared to the proposed amendment to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement. In the event
that Vermilion proposes to amend the terms of the transactions contemplated
in this Agreement and the Arrangement such that the Acquisition Proposal
would not result in a transaction more favourable to the Spartan
Shareholders, from a financial point of view, than the Arrangement as so
amended, as determined by the Spartan Board in good faith (after receiving
advice from the Spartan Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel) and
Vermilion advises the Spartan Board of such proposed amendment within four (4)
Business Days of receiving notice of such Superior Proposal, the Spartan
Board shall not: (i) accept, recommend, approve or enter into any agreement to
implement such Superior Proposal; or (ii) withdraw, modify or change its
recommendation in respect of the Arrangement. For greater certainty, each
successive amendment to an Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new
Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of this Section 3.4 and shall initiate
a new four (4) Business Day match right period. 
---|---|--- 
   | (f)| Vermilion agrees that all information that may be provided to it
by Spartan with respect to any Superior Proposal pursuant to this Section 3.4
shall be treated as if it were "Confidential Information" as that term is
defined in the Spartan Confidentiality Agreement and shall not be disclosed or
used except in accordance with the provisions of the Spartan Confidentiality
Agreement or in order to enforce its rights under this Agreement in legal
proceedings. 
---|---|--- 
   | (g)| If required by Vermilion, Spartan shall reaffirm its
recommendation of the Arrangement by press release promptly in the event
that: 
---|---|--- 
   | (i)| any Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced unless such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and Spartan otherwise
complies with Sections 3.4(d) and (e) in respect thereof; or 
---|---|--- 
   | (ii)| the Parties have entered into an amended agreement pursuant to
Section 3.4(e) which results in any Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior
Proposal. 
---|---|--- 
  

Vermilion and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the form and content of any such press release. Such press
release shall state that the Spartan Board has determined that the
Acquisition Proposal is not a Superior Proposal and shall reaffirm the
approvals, determinations and recommendations of the Spartan Board in respect
of this Agreement and the Arrangement.

    

36 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  



   | (h)| In the event that Spartan provides the notice contemplated by
Section 3.4(d)(iii) on a date which is less than four (4) Business Days prior
to the Spartan Meeting, Vermilion shall be entitled to require Spartan to
adjourn or postpone the Spartan Meeting to a date that is not more than seven
(7) Business Days following the date after Spartan has complied with its
obligations under Section 3.4(b)(vi)(B) and (C). 
---|---|--- 
   | (i)| Neither Spartan nor the Spartan Board shall withdraw, or qualify,
amend or modify in a manner adverse to Vermilion, the approval or
recommendation of the Arrangement by the Spartan Board, except if such
withdrawal, qualification, amendment or modification occurs simultaneously
with the entry by Spartan, in accordance with the requirements of Section
3.4(d) and Section 3.4(e), into a definitive agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal constituting a Superior Proposal. 
---|---|--- 
   | (j)| Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Spartan
Board from complying with Division 3 of National Instrument 62-104, _Takeover
Bids and Issuer Bids_ and similar provisions under Applicable Laws relating to
the provision of directors' circulars and make appropriate disclosure to its
securityholders. 
---|---|--- 
   | (k)| Spartan shall ensure that its Representatives are aware of the
provisions of this Section 3.4, and any violation of or the taking of any
action which is inconsistent with any of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 3.4 by any Representative shall be deemed to constitute a breach of
this Section 3.4 by its Representatives. 
---|---|--- 
   | 3.5| Access to Information 
---|---|--- 
   | (a)| From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement, Spartan shall, subject to
compliance with Applicable Laws and the terms of any contracts, upon
reasonable prior notice, provide Vermilion and its representatives access,
during normal business hours, to its premises, books, contracts, records,
computer systems, properties, employees and management personnel and shall
use its reasonable commercial efforts to furnish to Vermilion such
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Vermilion may
reasonably request in order to permit Vermilion to be in a position to
expeditiously and efficiently integrate Spartan's business and operations
immediately upon, but not prior to, the Effective Date. Spartan agrees to use
reasonable commercial efforts to keep Vermilion fully appraised in a
timely manner of every circumstance, action, occurrence or event occurring or
arising after the date hereof that would be relevant and material to a
prudent operator of the business and operations of Spartan including, but not
limited to, promptly providing Vermilion with any and all monthly activity
reports. 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| Spartan agrees to: 
---|---|--- 
   | (i)| give the legal and professional representatives and agents of
Vermilion reasonable access during normal business hours to Spartan's books,
records and documents as Vermilion may reasonably request, provided that
Spartan is satisfied, acting reasonably, that the confidentiality of the
subject matter of the disclosure can be maintained in accordance herewith;
and 
---|---|--- 
   | (ii)| endeavour to include in the information furnished to Vermilion
information which would reasonably be considered to be relevant for the
purposes of Vermilion's investigation and not knowingly withhold any
information which would make anything contained in the information delivered
erroneous or misleading. 
---|---|--- 
    

37 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  



   | (c)| The Parties acknowledge and agree that all information provided
by Spartan to Vermilion or by Vermilion to Spartan pursuant to this Section
3.5 shall remain subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements. 
---|---|--- 
   | (d)| Nothing in the foregoing shall require Spartan to disclose
information which it is prohibited from disclosing pursuant to a written
confidentiality agreement or confidentiality provision of an agreement with a
third party or information which, in the opinion of Spartan, acting
reasonably, is competitively sensitive (provided that Vermilion acknowledges
and agrees that Vermilion's external counsel may have access to such
information on a privileged and confidential basis in connection with
obtaining the Competition Act Approval).

Agreement shall be true and correct (for representations and warranties
qualified as to Material Adverse Effect, Material Adverse Change or other
materiality qualification, true and correct in all respects, and for all
other representations and warranties, true and correct in all respects, except
to the extent that the failure or failures of such representations and
warranties to be so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, would
not have a Material Adverse Effect on Vermilion) as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Effective Time, as though made on and as of the
Effective Time (except for representations and warranties made as of a
specified date, the accuracy of which shall be determined as of that
specified date). Spartan shall have received a certificate of Vermilion

and from time to time without prejudice to any other rights which Spartan may
have.

   | 5.4| Notice and Effect of Failure to Comply with Conditions 
---|---|--- 
   | (a)| Each Party shall give prompt notice to the other of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, at any time from the date hereof until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
of any event or state of facts which occurrence or failure would, or would be
likely to: 
---|---|--- 
   | (i)| cause any of the representations or warranties of such Party
contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect on the
date hereof or at the Effective Time; or 
---|---|--- 
   | (ii)| result in the failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by any Party
hereunder prior to the Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| Vermilion may not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement

written notice (the "Termination Notice") to the other Party (the "Breaching
Party") specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of covenants,

asserts as the basis for the termination right. If any such notice is
delivered, provided that the Breaching Party is proceeding diligently to cure
such matter and such matter is capable of being cured prior to the Outside
Date (it being agreed that matters arising out of any Wilful Breaches are not
capable of being cured), the Party seeking to terminate may not exercise such
termination right until the earlier of (a) the Outside Date, and (b) the date
that is 10 Business Days following receipt of such Termination Notice by the

postpone or adjourn the Spartan Meeting to the earlier of (a) three (3)
Business Days prior to the Outside Date and (b) the date that is 10 Business
Days following receipt of such Termination Notice by the Breaching Party.

Articles of Arrangement are filed under the ABCA to give effect to the
Arrangement.

Article 6 
 Agreement as to damages

   | 6.1| Vermilion Damages 
---|---|--- 
  

If at any time after the execution of this Agreement but prior to the
termination of this Agreement:

   | (a)| Vermilion shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(c)(i), 8.1(c)(ii) or 8.1(c)(iii), in which case the Vermilion
Damages Fee shall be paid to Vermilion within two (2) Business Days of such
termination; 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| (i) this Agreement shall have been terminated by Spartan or
Vermilion pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(b)(ii), but prior to
such termination by Spartan or Vermilion, an Acquisition Proposal shall have
been announced or made to Spartan or Spartan Shareholders or otherwise
publicly disclosed and not withdrawn prior to the date proposed for
the Spartan Meeting, and the Spartan Shareholders do not approve the
Arrangement or the Arrangement is not submitted for their approval; and (ii)
the Spartan Board shall have recommended, or Spartan shall have entered into
or become party to any contract with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition Proposal
referred to above) within 12 months of the date of such termination by
Spartan or Vermilion, in which case the Vermilion Damages Fee shall be paid
to Vermilion on the date on which such Acquisition Proposal (as it may be
modified or amended) is consummated (whether occurring during such 12 month
period or thereafter); 
---|---|--- 
   | (c)| Spartan shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(ii), in which case the Vermilion Damages Fee shall be paid to
Vermilion in accordance with Section 3.4(d); 
---|---|--- 
  

(each of the above being a "Vermilion Damages Event"), Spartan shall pay to
Vermilion $40,000,000 (the "Vermilion Damages Fee"), as liquidated damages in
immediately available funds to an account designated by Vermilion. Following a
Vermilion Damages Event, but prior to payment of the Vermilion Damages Fee as
required, Spartan shall be deemed to hold such funds in trust for Vermilion.
Spartan shall only be obligated to pay the Vermilion Damages Fee once
pursuant to this Section 6.1.

   | 6.2| Spartan Damages 
---|---|--- 
  

If, at any time after the execution of this Agreement but prior to the
termination of this Agreement, Spartan shall have terminated this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i) (the "Spartan Damages Event"), Vermilion shall
pay to Spartan $40,000,000 (the "Spartan Damages Fee"), as liquidated damages
in immediately available funds to an account designated by Spartan within two
(2) Business Days of such termination. Following a Spartan Damages Event, but
prior to payment of the Spartan Damages Fee as required, Vermilion shall be
deemed to hold such funds in trust for Spartan. Vermilion shall only be
obligated to pay the Spartan Damages Fee once pursuant to this Section 6.2.

   | 6.3| Injunctive Relief and Remedies 
---|---|--- 
  

Each Party agrees that irreparable harm would occur for which money damages
would not be an adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed by the other Party in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed that each Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to
restrain any breach or threatened breach by the other Party of the covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement or otherwise to obtain specific
performance of any of such act, covenants or agreements, without the
necessity of posting bond or security in connection therewith, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which such Party may be entitled at law or in
equity. Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in
Sections 6.1 and 6.2 are an integral part of the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, and that without these agreements the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement; and further that the payment of the Vermilion Damages Fee
and in the circumstances set out in Section 6.1 and the payment of the
Spartan Damages Fee in the circumstances set out in Section 6.2 is a payment
of liquidated damages which is a genuine pre-estimate of the damages which
Vermilion or Spartan, as applicable, shall suffer or incur as a result of the
event giving rise to such damages and resultant termination of this Agreement
and is not a penalty. Spartan and Vermilion, as applicable, irrevocably
waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that any such liquidated
damages are excessive or punitive.

holding of the Spartan Meeting but not later than the Effective Time, be
amended by written agreement of the Parties, subject to the Interim Order,
the Final Order and Applicable Laws, without further notice to or
authorization on the part of the Spartan Shareholders, provided that no such
amendment reduces or adversely affects the consideration to be received by an

ordered by the Court.

intention to do, or that it has done, any of the foregoing; 
---|---|--- 
   | (ii)| subject to Section 5.4, Spartan breaches any of its

forth in Section 5.1 or Section 5.2, except that the right to terminate

failure to fulfill any of its obligations in this Agreement has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of any of the conditions in Section 5.1
or Section 5.2;

   | (i)| subject to Section 5.4, if Vermilion breaches any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this

agreement relating to, such Superior Proposal, and that Spartan has previously
or concurrently will have paid to Vermilion the Vermilion Damages Fee; and
provided, further, that Spartan has not breached any of its covenants,
obligations or agreements in this Agreement, which breaches would,
individually or in the aggregate, give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in Section 5.1 or Section 5.2. 
---|---|--- 
  

In the event of the termination of this Agreement in the circumstances set
out in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this Section 8.1, this Agreement shall

ARTICLE 2 
 THE ARRANGEMENT

  

2.1 Effect of Arrangement

  

This Plan of Arrangement is made pursuant and subject to the provisions of
the Arrangement Agreement. The Articles of Arrangement and Certificate shall
be filed and issued, respectively, with respect to this Plan of Arrangement
in its entirety. The Certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the
Arrangement has become effective and is binding on all persons and that each
of the provisions of section 2.2 hereof has become effective in the sequence
set out therein.

  

2.2 Arrangement

  

Commencing at the Effective Time, each of the events and transactions set out
below shall occur and shall be deemed to occur in the following order without
any further act or formality:

   | (a)| the Dissent Shares held by Dissenting Shareholders shall be
transferred by the holders thereof to Spartan (free and clear of all liens,
claims and encumbrances) and cancelled and such Dissenting Shareholders shall
cease to have any rights as Spartan Shareholders, other than the right to be
paid the fair value of their Spartan Shares in accordance with the Dissent
Rights; and 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| all of the issued and outstanding Spartan Shares (other than any
Spartan Shares beneficially owned by and registered in the name of Vermilion)
shall be transferred by the holders thereof to Vermilion (free and clear of
all liens, claims and encumbrances) and Vermilion shall issue to each Spartan
Shareholder whose Spartan Shares have been so transferred 0.1476 of a
Vermilion Share for every one Spartan Share so transferred, subject
to section 2.3. 
---|---|--- 
  

2.3 Fractional Shares

  

Notwithstanding anything contained herein, no fractional Vermilion Shares
will be issued under this Plan of Arrangement. Where the aggregate number of
Vermilion Shares issuable to a former registered Spartan Shareholder pursuant
to section 2.2(b) would result in a fraction of a Vermilion Share being
issuable, such former Spartan Shareholder shall receive, in lieu of such
fractional share, the nearest whole number of Vermilion Shares, as
applicable. For greater certainty where such fractional interest is greater
than or equal to 0.5, the number of Vermilion Shares to be issued will be
rounded up to the nearest whole number and where such fractional interest is
less than 0.5, the number of Vermilion Shares to be issued will be rounded
down to the nearest whole number. In calculating such fractional interests,
all former Spartan Shares registered in the name of such former Spartan
Shareholder shall be aggregated without regard to any underlying
beneficial ownership of such former Spartan Shares.

  

2.4 Ownership and Registration

  

Upon the transfers pursuant to section 2.2:

    


--- 

 


--- 

    



  



   | (a)| Vermilion shall become the legal and beneficial owner of the
Spartan Shares transferred pursuant to section 2.2(b), free and clear of any
liens, claims or encumbrances, and Vermilion's name shall be added to the
register of holders of Spartan Shares as the sole registered holder of all
such Spartan Shares; and 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| the names of the former holders of all such Spartan Shares
transferred to Vermilion and of the Dissent Shares shall be removed from the
register of holders of Spartan Shares with respect to all such Spartan Shares. 
---|---|--- 
  

2.5 U.S. Securities Act Exemption

  

Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Vermilion and Spartan
agree that this Plan of Arrangement will be carried out with the intention
that all the persons to whom the Vermilion Shares are issued on completion of
this Plan of Arrangement will be issued by Vermilion in reliance on the
exemption from the registration requirements of the United States _Securities
Act of 1933_ , as provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereof and pursuant to
exemptions from registration under any applicable state securities laws.

  

ARTICLE 3 
 DISSENT RIGHTS

  

3.1 Each registered Spartan Shareholder may exercise rights of dissent
with respect to the Spartan Shares held by such registered
Spartan Shareholder in connection with the Arrangement pursuant to and in the
manner set forth in section 191 of the ABCA, as modified by the Interim Order
and this Article 3 ("Dissent Rights"), provided that registered Spartan
Shareholders who exercise such Dissent Rights and who:

   | (a)| are ultimately entitled to be paid fair value for their Spartan
Shares shall: (i) be deemed not to have participated in the transactions in
section 2.2(b); (ii) be paid an amount equal to such fair value by Spartan;
(iii) not be entitled to any other payment or consideration, and (iv) be
deemed to have transferred their respective Spartan Shares to Spartan for
cancellation at the Effective Time in accordance with section 2.2(a); or 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| are ultimately not entitled, for any reason, to be paid fair
value for their Spartan Shares shall: (i) be deemed to have participated in
the Arrangement, as of the Effective Time, on the same basis as a non-
dissenting holder of Spartan Shares; and (ii) be entitled to receive only the
consideration contemplated in section 2.2(b) that such Spartan Shareholders
would have received pursuant to the Arrangement if such Spartan Shareholders
had not exercised Dissent Rights, 
---|---|--- 
  

and, notwithstanding the provisions of section 191 of the ABCA, in no event
shall Vermilion, Spartan or any other person be required to recognize any
Spartan Shareholders who exercise Dissent Rights as Spartan Shareholders
after the Effective Time.

  

3.2 The fair value of the Spartan Shares shall be determined as of the
close of business on the last Business Day before the day on which the
Arrangement Resolution is approved by the Spartan Shareholders.

  

3.3 For greater certainty, in addition to any other restrictions in
section 191 of the ABCA, any person who has voted (including by way of
instructing a proxy holder to vote) their Spartan Shares in favour of the
Arrangement Resolution shall not be entitled to exercise Dissent Rights. In
addition, a Dissenting Shareholder may only exercise Dissent Rights in respect
of all, and not less than all, of its Spartan Shares.

    


--- 

 


--- 

    



  



  

3.4 Notwithstanding subsection 191(5) of the ABCA, the written
objection to the Arrangement Resolution referred to in subsection 191(5) of
the ABCA must be received in accordance with the Interim Order by Spartan no
later than 4:00 p.m. (Calgary time) on the second Business Day immediately
preceding the day of the Spartan Meeting.

  

ARTICLE 4 
 OUTSTANDING CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENT

  

4.1 Rights of Holders

  

Until deposited as contemplated by section 4.2, each certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Spartan Shares shall be
deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon
such deposit, the Vermilion Shares to which the former holders of such
Spartan Shares are entitled under the Arrangement or, as to those formerly
held by Dissenting Shareholders, other than those Dissenting Shareholders
deemed to have participated in the Arrangement pursuant to section 3.1(b), to
receive the fair value of the Spartan Shares represented by such
certificates.

  

4.2 Transmittal

  

The Depositary shall deliver the consideration in respect of those Spartan
Shares held on a book-entry basis in accordance with normal industry practice
for payments relating to securities held on a book-entry only basis. In
respect of those Spartan Shares not held on a book-entry basis, upon
surrender to the Depositary, as specified in the Letter of Transmittal, for
cancellation of a certificate that immediately before the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Spartan Shares that were transferred to
Vermilion in accordance with section 2.2(b) hereof, together with a completed
Letter of Transmittal and such additional documents and instruments as the
Depositary may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Depositary
shall deliver, a certificate representing the Vermilion Shares which such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to section 2.2(b) and the certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. The Depositary shall register the
Vermilion Shares in such name as such holder may direct in the Letter of
Transmittal, and shall either: (a) deliver such share certificates to such
address as such holder may direct in the Letter of Transmittal or (b) if
requested by such holder in the Letter of Transmittal, make such
certificates available at the Depositary for pickup by such holder.

  

4.3 Lost Certificates

  

In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Spartan Shares that were transferred to
Vermilion in accordance with section 2.2(b) hereof shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such certificate to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Depositary will issue and deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate a certificate representing the Vermilion Shares which
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to section 2.2(b). The person to
whom a certificate representing such Vermilion Shares is to be delivered
shall, as a condition precedent to such delivery, give a bond to Vermilion
and its transfer agent in form and substance satisfactory to Vermilion
and such transfer agent, or otherwise indemnify Vermilion and the transfer
agent, to the reasonable satisfaction of such parties, against any claim that
may be made against any of them with respect to the certificate alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

--- 

    



  



  

4.4 Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates

  

No dividend or other distribution declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Vermilion Shares with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Spartan
Shares unless and until the holder of such certificate shall have complied
with the provisions of section 4.2 or section 4.3. Subject to applicable law,
at the time of such compliance, there shall, in addition to the delivery of a
certificate representing the Vermilion Shares to which such holder is thereby
entitled, be delivered to such holder, without interest, the amount of the
dividend or other distribution with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such Vermilion Shares.

  

4.5 Termination of Rights

  

Any certificate formerly representing Spartan Shares that is not deposited
with all other documents as required by this Plan of Arrangement on or before
the last Business Day prior to the third anniversary of the Effective Date
shall cease to represent a right or interest of or a claim by any
former Spartan Shareholder of any kind or nature against Vermilion. On such
date, the Vermilion Shares to which the former holder of the certificate
referred to in the preceding sentence was ultimately entitled shall be deemed
to have been surrendered and forfeited to Vermilion, together with all
entitlements to dividends or distributions thereon held for such former
registered holder, for no consideration, and such shares and rights shall
thereupon be cancelled and the name of the former registered holder shall
be removed from the register of holders of such shares.

  

ARTICLE 5 
 WITHHOLDINGS

  

Vermilion, Spartan and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to any former Spartan
Shareholder under this Plan of Arrangement, including from any amount payable
to any Dissenting Shareholder or any dividend or other distribution
payable pursuant to section 4.4, as the case may be, such amounts as
Vermilion, Spartan or the Depositary is required to deduct and withhold from
such consideration in accordance with the Tax Act, the United States Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, or any other provision of any applicable law. Any such
amounts will be deducted and withheld from the consideration payable pursuant
to this Plan of Arrangement and shall be treated for all purposes as having
been paid to the former Spartan Shareholder in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are
actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that the
amount so required to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a former
Spartan Shareholder exceeds the cash component, if any, of the consideration
otherwise payable to the holder, Vermilion and the Depositary are hereby
authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such portion of the Vermilion
Shares otherwise issuable to the holder as is necessary to provide
sufficient funds to Vermilion or the Depositary, as the case may be, to
enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement and
Vermilion or the Depositary shall notify the holder thereof and remit the
applicable portion of the net proceeds of such sale to the appropriate taxing
authority and shall remit to such holder any unapplied balance of the proceeds
of such sale.

  

ARTICLE 6 
 AMENDMENTS

  

6.1 Vermilion and Spartan may amend, modify and/or supplement this Plan
of Arrangement at any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Time,
provided that each such amendment, modification and/or supplement must be: (i)
set out in writing; (ii) approved by both parties; (iii) filed with the Court
and, if made following the Spartan Meeting, approved by the Court; and (iv)
communicated to by Spartan Shareholders if and as required by the Court.

  

6.2 Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of
Arrangement may be proposed by Vermilion or Spartan at any time prior to or
at the Spartan Meeting (provided that the other party shall have consented
thereto) with or without any other prior notice or communication, and if so
proposed and accepted by the persons voting at the Spartan Meeting (other than
as may be required under the Interim Order), shall become part of this Plan
of Arrangement for all purposes.

    


--- 

 


--- 

    



  



  

6.3 Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of
Arrangement that is approved or directed by the Court following the
Spartan Meeting shall be effective only: (i) if it is consented to in writing
by each of Vermilion and Spartan (each acting reasonably); and (ii) if
required by the Court, it is consented to by the Spartan Shareholders, voting
in the manner directed by the Court.

  

6.4 Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of
Arrangement may be made following the Effective Date unilaterally by
Vermilion provided that it concerns a matter which, in the reasonable opinion
of Vermilion, is of an administrative nature required to better give effect
to the implementation of this Plan of Arrangement.
