shares.

(b) _Treatment of Telaria Equity Awards_.

 

(i) The Merger shall constitute a "Corporate Transaction" and "Change in
Control" for purposes of (A) the Telaria 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and all
awards granted thereunder or otherwise subject to the terms thereof and (B)
the ScanScout, Inc. 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, and all awards
granted thereunder.

 

(ii) Each stock option to purchase shares of Telaria Common Stock (a "
_Telaria Stock Option_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
assumed by Rubicon Project in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Telaria Equity Incentive Plan and the applicable award agreement evidencing
such Telaria Stock Option, and converted into an option (a " _Rubicon Project
Stock Option_ ") to purchase (i) that number of shares of Rubicon Project
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of
(A) the number of shares of Telaria Common Stock subject to such Telaria Stock

, that the exercise price and number of shares of Rubicon Project Common Stock
shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section

expressly provided in this _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)(ii)_, each such Rubicon
Project Stock Option shall be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including vesting and exercisability terms) as applied to the corresponding
Telaria Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(iii) Each award of time-based vesting restricted stock units relating to
Telaria Common Stock (each, a " _Telaria RSU Award_ ") that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof:

 



6

    

(A) if such Telaria RSU Award either becomes vested at the Effective Time
pursuant to its terms or is vested at the Effective Time, be cancelled and

Common Stock equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Telaria
Common Stock subject to such Telaria RSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (2) the Exchange Ratio (plus a cash payment in respect of
any fractional shares in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.1(c_)), less
applicable Tax withholding, payable by Rubicon Project promptly following the

contained in this Agreement, any payment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
3.1(b)(iii)(A)_ in respect of any such Telaria RSU Award which constitutes
"deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on
the earliest possible date that such payment would not trigger a tax or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code; or

 

(B) if such Telaria RSU Award is not vested at the Effective Time, be
assumed by Rubicon Project in accordance with the terms of the Telaria 2013
Equity Incentive Plan and the applicable award agreement evidencing such
Telaria RSU Award and converted into an award of Rubicon Project restricted
stock units with the same terms and conditions that applied to such Telaria
RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that all references

by Rubicon Project), relating to a number of shares of Rubicon Project Common
Stock equal to the product, rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares, of (1) the number of shares of Telaria Common Stock subject to such
Telaria RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) the
Exchange Ratio.

(iv) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Telaria or the
appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions providing for the
treatment of the Telaria Stock Options and the Telaria RSU Awards
(collectively, the " _Telaria Equity Awards_ ") as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_ and shall deliver notice of such treatment (which
notices shall have been approved by Rubicon Project, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld) to each holder of Telaria Equity Awards.

(v) Telaria shall take all actions necessary such that any current offering
period as of the date of this Agreement shall be the final offering period
under the Telaria 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Telaria ESPP_ ").
In addition, effective as of the date of this Agreement, Telaria shall have
taken all actions necessary such that (x) no new participant shall be
permitted to join any current offering period in progress under the Telaria
ESPP and (y) no participant in the Telaria ESPP with respect to any current
offering period shall be permitted to increase his or her contributions or
the amount of withholding elections with respect to any current offering
period. Unless it has earlier terminated, Telaria shall take all actions
necessary so that the Telaria ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Telaria shall shorten the
duration of any then current offering period under the Telaria ESPP and
purchase shares of Telaria Common Stock with all amounts withheld by Telaria
on behalf of the participants in the Telaria ESPP as of such date. Any shares

 



7

    

 of Telaria Common Stock so purchased shall be treated in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)_ above. All amounts withheld by Telaria on behalf of
the participants in the Telaria ESPP that have not been used to purchase
shares of Telaria Common Stock at or prior to the Effective Time will be
returned to the participants without interest pursuant to the terms of the
Telaria ESPP upon the termination of the Telaria ESPP.

(vi) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Rubicon Project
or the appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions providing for
the assumption of the Telaria Equity Incentive Plans and all award agreements
outstanding thereunder and all outstanding award agreements evidencing Telaria
Equity Awards granted outside of the Telaria 2013 Equity Incentive Plan that
are subject to the terms of the Telaria 2013 Equity Incentive Plan.

(vii) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event
later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), Rubicon Project
shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement under the
Securities Act on Form S-8, Form S-3 or another appropriate form (and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness thereof and
maintain the current status of the prospectuses contained therein)
registering the shares of Rubicon Project Common Stock necessary to fulfill
Rubicon ProjectÂ’s obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_. Rubicon
Project shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Rubicon Project Common Stock for delivery with
respect to the Telaria Equity Awards assumed by it in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_ and the assumption of the Telaria Equity Incentive
Plans and all award agreements outstanding thereunder and all outstanding
award agreements evidencing Telaria Equity Awards granted outside of the
Telaria 2013 Equity Incentive Plan that are subject to the terms of the
Telaria 2013 Equity Incentive Plan.

(c) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional share of Rubicon Project Common
Stock (or certificate or scrip representing the same) shall be issued upon the
conversion or surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
hereunder, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to any Rubicon Project Common Stock or to vote or to any other rights
of a holder of Rubicon Project Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Telaria Common Stock
converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Rubicon Project Common Stock (after
aggregating all Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-
Entry Shares delivered by or on behalf of such holder) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the average of the
closing sale prices for one share of Rubicon Project Common Stock on the NYSE
(as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported therein, in
another authoritative source mutually selected by Rubicon Project and Telaria)
for the ten (10) consecutive full trading days ending on the full trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date. The parties acknowledge that payment
of cash in lieu of fractional share interests pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
3.1(c)_ is not separately bargained-for consideration, but merely represents
a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional
shares.

 



8

    

(d) _No Dissenters Â’ Rights_. In accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Telaria Common
Stock or Rubicon Project Common Stock in connection with the Merger.

 

Section 3.2. _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

 

(a) _Designation of Exchange Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to
the Closing, Rubicon Project shall enter into a customary exchange agreement
with the transfer agent of Rubicon Project, the transfer agent of Telaria or
another nationally recognized financial institution or trust company
designated by Rubicon Project and reasonably acceptable to Telaria (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)(i)_. Prior to or substantially concurrently with the
Effective Time, Rubicon Project shall deposit or cause to be deposited with
the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this _Article III_ through
the Exchange Agent, book-entry shares representing the full number of whole
shares of Rubicon Project Common Stock issuable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
3.1(a)(i)_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Telaria Common Stock, and
Rubicon Project shall, after the Effective Time on the appropriate payment
date, if applicable, provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent
any dividends or other distributions payable on such shares of Rubicon Project
Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(d_). In addition, Rubicon Project
shall deposit cash in an amount sufficient to make payments in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_ prior to or
substantially concurrently with the Effective Time (and from time to time
thereafter if necessary). All such shares of Rubicon Project Common
Stock provided to the Exchange Agent, together with any such dividends or
other distributions with respect thereto, and all cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent, is hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

(b) _Letters of Transmittal and Instructions for Surrender_. As promptly
as practicable following the Effective Time, and in no event later than the
fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, Rubicon Project shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ")
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Telaria Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be
in the form and have such other provisions as are reasonably acceptable to
Rubicon Project and Telaria) and (ii) instructions (which instructions shall
be in the form and have such other provisions as are reasonably acceptable to
Rubicon Project and Telaria) for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for (A) the number of shares of Rubicon Project
Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry form) representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of such Certificates pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.1(a)(i)_, (B) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(d)_ and (C) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Rubicon
Project Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_.

 

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon
surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (i) the

 



9

    

 number of shares of Rubicon Project Common Stock (which shall be in book-
entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that
such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)(i)_, (ii) any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(d)_ and (iii) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Rubicon Project Common Stock payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. No holder of record of a
book-entry share (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Telaria Common Stock shall be
required to deliver a Certificate or letter of transmittal or surrender such
Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, and in lieu thereof, each Book-Entry
Share shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive (x)
the number of shares of Rubicon Project Common Stock (which shall be in book-
entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that
such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)(i)_, (y) any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.2(d)_ and (z) any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Rubicon Project Common Stock payable pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_. Until surrendered, in the case of a Certificate,
or paid for, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, in each case, as contemplated
by this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
3.2(c)_ and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 3.2(d)_. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and make such payments and deliveries
with respect to Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on the Merger Consideration or any cash payable hereunder.

 

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. Subject to
Applicable Law, there shall be paid to the holders of the Rubicon Project
Common Stock issued in exchange for Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_, without interest, (i) at the time of delivery of
such Rubicon Project Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 3.2(c)_, the amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
shares of Rubicon Project Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record
date after the Effective Time, but prior to such delivery of such Rubicon
Project Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
3.2(c)_, and a payment date subsequent to such delivery of such Rubicon
Project Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.2(c)_, payable with respect to such shares of Rubicon Project Common Stock.

(e) _Certain Transfers of Ownership_. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Telaria Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of Telaria, payment of the appropriate amount of Merger Consideration
(and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Rubicon Project
Common Stock as contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 3.2(d)_) may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and accompanied by all documents
reasonably required by the Exchange Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be
properly transferred and the Person requesting such payment shall pay

 



10

    

 any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Rubicon Project that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable.

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Rubicon Project or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Rubicon Project may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

 

(g) _No Further Ownership Rights in Telaria Common Stock_. All shares of
Rubicon Project Common Stock (together with cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Rubicon Project Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_)
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this  _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been
issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Telaria Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares. After the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of Telaria of shares of Telaria Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Rubicon Project,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for transfer following the
Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable
Merger Consideration for each share of Telaria Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(h) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Rubicon
Project or its designee upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger
who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter
look only to Rubicon Project as general creditor thereof for payment of their
claims for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any
dividends or distributions with respect to Rubicon Project Common Stock as
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 3.2(d)_.

(i) _No Liability_. None of Rubicon Project, Merger Sub, Telaria or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of
Rubicon Project Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a Governmental Entity
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable
Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered or Book-Entry Share
not paid, in each case, in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_,
immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise become the property of
any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, become the property of Rubicon Project free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 



11

    

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, each of Rubicon Project, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax law.
Any amounts so withheld and properly remitted to the applicable Governmental
Entity shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 

Section 3.3. _Certain Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions
of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the execution of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number or type of
outstanding shares of Rubicon Project Common Stock or Telaria Common Stock
shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, exchange,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), combination or readjustment of
shares or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during
such period, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent
items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ shall be construed to
permit any party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted
by any other provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 3.4. _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is determined by Rubicon Project or the Surviving
Corporation to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or Rubicon Project with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub
and Telaria with respect to the Merger, the officers and managers of Rubicon
Project shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, Telaria, the
Surviving Corporation and otherwise) to take such action.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

Section 4.1. _Representations and Warranties of Telaria_. Except as set
forth in any Telaria SEC Document filed with the SEC since January 1, 2017
and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (as amended prior
to the date of this Agreement, the " _Telaria Filed SEC Documents_ ")
(excluding any disclosures in any risk factors section, in any section
related to forward-looking statements and other disclosures that are
predictive or forward-looking in nature) or as disclosed in the disclosure
letter delivered by Telaria to Rubicon Project upon the execution of this
Agreement (the " _Telaria Disclosure Letter_ ") and making reference to the
particular subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being taken (
_provided_ that such disclosure shall be deemed to qualify that particular
subsection and such other subsections of this Agreement to the extent that it
is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure
also qualifies or applies to such other subsections), Telaria represents and
warrants to Rubicon Project as follows:

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of Telaria and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good

 



12

    

 standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under
the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite
corporate or other power, as the case may be, and authority to carry on its
business as now being conducted, except, as to Subsidiaries, for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing, individually and in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Telaria. Each of Telaria and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed or in good standing, individually and in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Telaria. The
Certificate of Incorporation of Telaria and the Bylaws of Telaria, in each
case as amended through the date of this Agreement, have been filed prior to
the date of this Agreement with the Telaria Filed SEC Documents.

(b) _Corporate Authority; Non-contravention_.

(i) Telaria has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to the Telaria Stockholder Approval, to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Telaria and the consummation by Telaria of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Telaria, subject, in the case of the Merger,
to the Telaria Stockholder Approval. The Board of Directors of Telaria (at a
meeting duly called and held) has, by the unanimous vote of all directors of
Telaria, (A) determined that entering into this Agreement and consummating the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable and fair
to, and in the best interests of, Telaria and its stockholders, (B)
authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Telaria and approved the Merger and (C) resolved to recommend the
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Telaria Common Stock and
directed that this Agreement be submitted for consideration by TelariaÂ’s
stockholders at the Telaria Stockholders Meeting, and, subject to _Section_ __
_ 5.2(b_), such resolutions have not been rescinded, modified or withdrawn
in any way. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Telaria
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Rubicon Project and Merger Sub, constitutes the legal, valid and binding

documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein,
regardless of when such exhibits and other information were filed) with the
SEC since January 1, 2017 (the " _Telaria SEC Documents_ "). As of their

with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as
amended (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to the Telaria SEC
Documents, and none of the Telaria SEC Documents when filed and at their
respective effective times, if applicable, contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from
the SEC with respect to any of the Telaria SEC Documents, and, to the
Knowledge of Telaria, none of the Telaria SEC Documents is the subject of any

schedules) of Telaria and its Subsidiaries included in the Telaria SEC
Documents (the " _Telaria Financial Statements_ ") were prepared in accordance

(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of Telaria and its consolidated

material and to any other adjustments described therein, including the notes
thereto). Since December 31, 2016, no independent public accounting firm of
Telaria has resigned (or informed Telaria that it intends to resign) or been

 Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 6, 2019, (B) for
liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since September 30, 2019 and (C) for
liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with or contemplated by
this Agreement, neither Telaria nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a
consolidated balance sheet of Telaria and its Subsidiaries (or in the notes
thereto) that, individually and in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Telaria.

(iv) Telaria maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (B) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (C) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
TelariaÂ’s properties or assets. Since January 1, 2017, none of Telaria,
TelariaÂ’s independent accountants, the Board of Directors of Telaria or its
audit committee has received any oral or written notification of any (1)
"significant deficiency" in the internal controls over financial reporting of
Telaria, (2) "material weakness" in the internal controls over financial
reporting of Telaria or (3) fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees of Telaria who have a significant role in the
internal controls over financial reporting of Telaria.

 

(v) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Telaria are
reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-
financial) required to be disclosed by Telaria in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that
all such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated
to the management of Telaria, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of Telaria to make the certifications required under
the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 

(vi) Neither Telaria nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Telaria and any
of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements"
(as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where
the purpose or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Telaria or any of
its Subsidiaries in TelariaÂ’s or such SubsidiaryÂ’s published financial
statements or other Telaria SEC Documents.

 

(f) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Telaria for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, and at any time
it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or

in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading, or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement
will, at the date it is first mailed to TelariaÂ’s stockholders or at the time
of the Telaria Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by Telaria with respect
to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by or on behalf of Rubicon Project for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.

to the particular subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being

to the Rubicon Project SEC Documents, and none of the Rubicon Project SEC
Documents when filed and at their respective effective times, if applicable,

that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC and that all such information required to be disclosed is
accumulated and communicated to the management of Rubicon Project, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
enable the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Rubicon
Project to make the certifications required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports.

 

(vi) Neither Rubicon Project nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or
has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Rubicon Project
and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the
Exchange Act)), where the purpose or intended effect of such contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Rubicon Project or any of its Subsidiaries in Rubicon
ProjectÂ’s or such SubsidiaryÂ’s published financial statements or other Rubicon
Project SEC Documents.

necessary, appropriate or desirable arrangements in connection with each
partyÂ’s credit agreement or other documents governing or relating to

Time, it may be necessary for Rubicon Project and/or Telaria to enter into
financing transactions (including the raising of new financing, the
refinancing of existing indebtedness, the retirement of existing indebtedness
and/or producing amendments, modifications or consents in relation to
existing indebtedness) (any such financing transaction mutually agreed to by

connection with any Pre-Merger Financing Transaction, each of Telaria (with
respect to itself and its Subsidiaries) and Rubicon Project (with respect to
itself and its Subsidiaries) agree, to the extent requested by the other,

5.1(e)_, neither Telaria nor Rubicon Project shall be required to disclose any
information pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.1(e)_ to the extent that (A) in
the reasonable good faith judgment of such party, any Applicable Law requires
such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such
information or (B) disclosure of any such information or document would result
in the loss of attorney-client privilege, attorney work product or other
relevant legal privilege; _provided_ that, with respect to _clauses (A)_ and
_(B)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 5.1(e)_, Telaria or Rubicon Project,
as applicable, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (1) develop
an alternative to providing such information so as to address such matters
that is reasonably acceptable to the other party and (2) utilize the
procedures of a joint defense agreement or implement such other techniques if
the parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of
such information without violating Applicable Law or jeopardizing such
privilege.

Section 5.2. _No Solicitation by Telaria_.

 

(a) Telaria shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
officers and directors, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its and
its Subsidiaries other employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants and other representatives (each, a " _Representative_
") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage (including by way of furnishing information), or take any other
action to facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal
the consummation of which would constitute a Telaria Alternative Transaction,
or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations, or cooperate in any
way with any Person (or group of Persons), with respect to any inquiries
regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of which would
constitute a Telaria Alternative Transaction (except to notify a Person (or
group of Persons) that makes any inquiry, offer or proposal of the existence
of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_). Telaria shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing solicitation,
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Telaria Alternative Transaction, or any inquiry or proposal that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Telaria Alternative Transaction, request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished in connection therewith and immediately terminate all physical and
electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such Person or its
Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to
obtaining the Telaria Stockholder Approval, Telaria or any of
its Representatives receives a _bona fide_ written proposal for a Telaria
Alternative Transaction that did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __
_ 5.2(a)_ and the Board of Directors of Telaria determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
that any such proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result
in, a Telaria Superior Proposal, subject to compliance with  _Section_ __ _
5.2(c)_, Telaria and its Representatives may: (A) furnish information with
respect to Telaria and its Subsidiaries to the Person (or group of Persons)
making such proposal (and its Representatives) ( _provided_ that all such
information has previously been provided to Rubicon Project or is provided to
Rubicon Project prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is
provided to such Person) pursuant to an agreement that requires
any counterparty thereto (and any of its Affiliates and Representatives) that
receives non-public information of, or with respect to, Telaria to keep such
information confidential ( _provided_ , _further_ , that the provisions
contained therein (x) with respect to confidentiality and use are no less
favorable to Telaria in the aggregate than the provisions of the
confidentiality agreement, dated as of August 28, 2019, between Telaria
and Rubicon Project (as amended, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") (it
being understood that such agreement need not prohibit the making by such
counterparty of any proposal in respect of a Telaria Alternative Transaction)
and (y) do not prohibit Telaria from satisfying its obligations hereunder);
and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such proposal
with the Person (or group of Persons) making such proposal and its
Representatives. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Telaria Alternative
Transaction_ " means any of (1) a transaction or series of transactions
pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) other than Rubicon Project
and its Subsidiaries (such Person (or group of Persons), a " _Telaria Third
Party_ "), or the direct or indirect stockholders of such Telaria Third Party
or the resulting company, acquires or would acquire, directly or 

 



53

    

 indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the
Exchange Act) of, or would otherwise own or control, directly or indirectly,
more than 20% of the outstanding shares of Telaria Common Stock or securities
(or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, such securities) representing more than 20% or more of the
equity or voting power of Telaria (or the resulting company), (2) a merger,
consolidation, share exchange or similar transaction pursuant to which any
Telaria Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, assets
or businesses of Telaria or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than
20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a
consolidated basis) of Telaria and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (3) any
transaction pursuant to which any Telaria Third Party acquires or would
acquire, directly or indirectly, control of assets (including for this purpose
the outstanding equity securities of Subsidiaries of Telaria and any entity
surviving any merger or combination including any of them) of Telaria or
any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 20% or more of the revenues,
net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of Telaria and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (4) any disposition of assets to a Telaria
Third Party representing more than 20% or more of the revenues, net income or
assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of Telaria and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Telaria Superior
Proposal_ " means any bona fide written proposal (on its most recently
amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a Telaria Third
Party to enter into a Telaria Alternative Transaction (with all references to
20% in the definition of Telaria Alternative Transaction being treated as
references to 50% for these purposes) that (A) was not solicited, initiated,
knowingly encouraged or facilitated in violation of this _Section_ __ _
5.2(a),_ (B) is on terms that the Board of Directors of Telaria determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) to be superior from a financial point of view to TelariaÂ’s
stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking
into account all relevant factors (including financial, regulatory, legal and
other aspects of such proposal, any changes to this Agreement that may be
proposed by Rubicon Project in response to such proposal to enter into
a Telaria Alternative Transaction and the identity of the Person making such
proposal to enter into a Telaria Alternative Transaction), and (C) is
reasonably likely to be completed in accordance with its terms, taking into
account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal,
and is not subject to a diligence or financing condition. Telaria acknowledges
and agrees that, in the event any Representative of Telaria or any of its
Subsidiaries takes any action that if taken by Telaria would be a breach of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_, the taking of such action by such Representative
will be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement by Telaria.

 

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_ or _Section_ __ _
5.2(d)_, neither the Board of Directors of Telaria nor any committee thereof
shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw,
qualify or modify, in each case in a manner adverse to Rubicon Project, the
Telaria Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, or propose publicly to approve,
any Telaria Alternative Transaction, (iii) recommend, or propose publicly to
recommend, any Telaria Alternative Transaction, (iv) fail to include in the
Joint Proxy Statement the Telaria Board Recommendation, (v) fail to publicly
and without qualification recommend against a tender or exchange offer
relating to shares of Telaria Common Stock within ten (10) Business Days after
the commencement thereof (or, if earlier, at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Telaria Stockholders Meeting) or (vi) fail to publicly reaffirm
without qualification the Telaria Board Recommendation within ten (10)
Business Days of Rubicon ProjectÂ’s written request to do so (or, if earlier,
at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Telaria StockholdersÂ’ Meeting)

 



54

    

 following the public announcement of any Telaria Alternative Transaction;
_provided_ , that Rubicon Project shall not be entitled to make such written
request, and the Board of Directors of Telaria shall not be required to make
such reaffirmation, more than once with respect to any particular Telaria
Alternative Transaction unless the proposal in respect of such Telaria
Alternative Transaction is subsequently publicly modified in any material
respect in which case Rubicon Project may make such request once each time
such modification is made (any action or failure to act in _clauses (i)_
through _(vi)_ being referred to as a " _Telaria Recommendation Change_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, prior to obtaining the
Telaria Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of Telaria determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that it has
received a Telaria Superior Proposal that was not solicited, initiated,
knowingly encouraged or facilitated in violation of _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_,
the Board of Directors of Telaria may effect a Telaria Recommendation Change
(other than under _clause (ii)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_ if it would
include entering into an agreement with respect to any Telaria Alternative
Transaction) if, but only if, (A) the Board of Directors of Telaria
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law, (B) Telaria has notified Rubicon Project in
writing that it intends to effect a Telaria Recommendation Change pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b) _(other than under _clause (ii)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_ if it would include entering into an agreement with
respect to any Telaria Alternative Transaction), (C) Telaria has provided
Rubicon Project with, or publicly disclosed, a copy of the proposed definitive
agreements and other proposed transaction documentation between Telaria and
the Person making such Telaria Superior Proposal, and the identity of the
Person making such Telaria Superior Proposal, (D) for a period of four (4)
Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to _clause (B)_ of
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_, Telaria shall have discussed and negotiated in
good faith and made TelariaÂ’s Representatives available to discuss and
negotiate in good faith (in each case to the extent Rubicon Project desires
to negotiate) with Rubicon ProjectÂ’s Representatives any proposed
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the Telaria Superior
Proposal no longer constitutes a Telaria Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that Telaria shall provide written notice to Rubicon
Project of any amendment to any material term or condition of any Telaria
Superior Proposal and the time period set forth in this _clause (D)_ shall
be extended to the later to occur of (I) two (2) Business Days following
delivery of such subsequent notice from Telaria to Rubicon Project and (II)
the expiration of the original four (4)-Business Day period described in this
_clause (D)_ ), and (E) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period,
the Board of Directors of Telaria shall have determined in good faith, (x)
after consultation with outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
and after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to
this Agreement, that the Telaria Alternative Transaction that is the subject
of the notice described in _clause (B)_ above still constitutes a
Telaria Superior Proposal and (y) after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would still be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. Neither the Board of Directors of
Telaria nor any committee thereof shall cause or permit Telaria or any of its
controlled Affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement related to any Telaria
Alternative Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_).

(c) In addition to the obligations of Telaria set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.2(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_, Telaria shall promptly, and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt 

 



55

    

 thereof, advise Rubicon Project in writing of any request for information or
proposal relating to a Telaria Alternative Transaction, the material terms and
conditions of such request or proposal (including any changes thereto) and
the identity of the Person making such request or proposal. Telaria shall (i)
keep Rubicon Project reasonably informed of the status and details (including
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or proposal on a
reasonably current basis and (ii) provide to Rubicon Project as soon as
reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all
correspondence and other written materials received from the Person
making such request or proposal or any of its Representatives, in each case
that describes or contains any such request or proposal.

 

(d) Other than in connection with a Telaria Superior Proposal (which shall
be subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_ and shall not be subject to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(d)_), prior to obtaining the Telaria Stockholder Approval,
the Board of Directors of Telaria may, in response to a Telaria
Intervening Event, take any action prohibited by _clauses (i)_ or _(iii)_ of
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_ in the event that the Board of Directors of Telaria
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law if, but only if, (i) Telaria has notified Rubicon
Project in writing that it intends to effect a Telaria Recommendation Change
(under  _clauses (i)_ or _(iii)_ of _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_) pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(d_) (which notice shall specify the facts and
circumstances providing the basis of the Telaria Intervening Event and for
the determination by the Board of Directors of Telaria to effect a Telaria
Recommendation Change under _clauses_ __ _ (i)_ or _(iii)_ of _Section_ __ _
5.2(b)_ in reasonable detail), (ii) for a period of four (4) Business Days
following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (i) of this _Section_ __ _
5.2(d)_, Telaria shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith and made
TelariaÂ’s Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith
(in each case to the extent Rubicon Project desires to negotiate) with Rubicon
ProjectÂ’s Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement so that the failure to take such action would no longer be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties under Applicable Law of the Board of
Directors of Telaria (it being understood and agreed that Telaria shall
provide Rubicon Project with written notice of any material change to the
relevant facts and circumstances and the time period set forth in this clause
(ii) shall be extended to the later to occur of (A) two (2) Business
Days following delivery of such subsequent notice from Telaria to Rubicon
Project and (B) the expiration of the original four (4)-Business Day period
described above in this _clause (ii)_ ), and (iii) no earlier than the end of
such negotiation period, the Board of Directors of Telaria shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, and
after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement, that the failure to take such action would still be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. The term " _Telaria
Intervening Event_ " means a material event or circumstance that was not known
or reasonably foreseeable to any of the directors or officers of Telaria on
the date of this Agreement (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board of
Directors of Telaria as of the date of this Agreement), which event or
circumstance, or any consequence thereof, becomes known to the Board of
Directors of Telaria prior to the Telaria Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
that in no event shall any inquiry, offer or proposal that constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Telaria Alternative Transaction
constitute a Telaria Intervening Event; _provided_ _further_ , in no event
shall any of the following, either alone or in combination, constitute a
Telaria Intervening Event: (1) any change in and of itself in the market
price or trading volume of the securities of Rubicon Project or Telaria (it

 



56

    

 being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing
to such change may constitute or be taken into account in determining whether
there has been a Telaria Intervening Event), (2) any Change affecting general
business, economic or political conditions, the industries or segments thereof
in which Telaria operates, or the financial, credit or securities markets of
the United States or in any other country in the world; (3) Changes arising

or (6) meeting or exceeding, or failing to meet or exceed, any internal or
other or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions in and of
itself (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise or
contributing to Telaria meeting or exceeding, or failing to meet or exceed,
such projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions may constitute or be
taken into account in determining whether there has been a Telaria Intervening
Event).

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ shall prohibit Telaria
from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from

of its position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders
that the Board of Directors of Telaria determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ ,

a Telaria Recommendation Change shall be subject to the provisions of

in accordance with the rules set forth in _clause (i)_ of this _Section_ __
_ 5.2(e)_, in and of itself, shall not be deemed to constitute a Telaria
Recommendation Change and (y) any public disclosure of or communication
relating to a Telaria Alternative Transaction (but solely to the extent such
disclosure or communication is required to be made by Applicable Law), in and
of itself, shall not be deemed to constitute a Telaria Recommendation Change
so long as any such disclosure or communication includes an express
reaffirmation of the Telaria Board Recommendation).

 

Section 5.3. _No Solicitation by_ _Rubicon Project_.

 

(a) Rubicon Project shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their officers and directors, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause
its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ other employees and Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way
of furnishing information), or take any other action to facilitate, any
inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of which
would constitute a Rubicon Project Alternative Transaction or (ii) participate
in any discussions or negotiations, or cooperate in any way with any Person
(or group of Persons), with respect to any inquiries regarding, or the making
of, any proposal the consummation of which would constitute a Rubicon Project
Alternative Transaction (except to notify a Person (or group of Persons)
that makes any inquiry, offer or proposal of the existence of the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_). Rubicon Project shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated all existing solicitation, discussions or

57

    

 Project Alternative Transaction, or any inquiry or proposal that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Rubicon Project Alternative Transaction,
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished in connection therewith and immediately terminate all
physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such Person
or its Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior
to obtaining the Rubicon Project Stockholder Approval, Rubicon Project or any
of its Representatives receives a _bona fide_ written proposal for a Rubicon
Project Alternative Transaction that did not result from a breach of this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ and the Board of Directors of Rubicon Project
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and
financial advisors) that any such proposal constitutes, or would reasonably
be expected to result in, a Rubicon Project Superior Proposal, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_, Rubicon Project and its Representatives may: (A)
furnish information with respect to Telaria and its Subsidiaries to the Person
(or group of Persons) making such proposal (and its Representatives) (
_provided_ that all such information has previously been provided to Rubicon
Project or is provided to Rubicon Project prior to or substantially concurrent
with the time it is provided to such Person) pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement that requires any counterparty thereto (and any of its Affiliates
and Representatives) that receive non-public information of, or with
respect to, Rubicon Project to keep such information confidential (
_provided_ , _further_ , that the provisions contained therein (x) with
respect to confidentiality and use are no less favorable to Rubicon Project in
the aggregate than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) do
not prohibit Rubicon Project from satisfying its obligations hereunder); and
(B) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such proposal with
the Person (or group of Persons) making such proposal and its
Representatives. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Rubicon Project
Alternative Transaction_ " means, other than the Rubicon Project Share
Issuance, any of (1) a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to

the resulting company, acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly,
beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of, or
would otherwise own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the
outstanding shares of Rubicon Project Common Stock or securities (or options,
rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for, such securities) representing more than 20% or more of the equity or
voting power of Rubicon Project (or the resulting company), (2) a merger,
consolidation, share exchange or similar transaction pursuant to which any
Rubicon Project Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly

assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of Rubicon Project and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (3) any transaction pursuant to which any

treated as references to 50% for these purposes) that (A) was not solicited,
initiated, knowingly encouraged or facilitated in violation of this _Section_
__ _ 5.3(a)_, (B) is on terms that the Board of Directors of Rubicon Project
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel) to be superior from a financial point of view to
Rubicon ProjectÂ’s stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, taking into account all relevant factors (including financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal, any changes to this
Agreement that may be proposed by Rubicon Project in response to such
proposal to enter into a Telaria Alternative Transaction and the identity of
the Person making such proposal to enter into a Telaria Alternative
Transaction), and (C) is reasonably likely to be completed in accordance with
its terms, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal, and is not subject to a diligence or financing
condition. Rubicon Project acknowledges and agrees that, in the event any
Representative of Rubicon Project or any of its Subsidiaries takes any action
that if taken by Rubicon Project would be a breach of this _Section_ __ _
5.3(a)_, the taking of such action by such Representative will be deemed to
constitute a breach of this Agreement by Rubicon Project.

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ or  _Section_ __ _
5.3(d)_, neither the Board of Directors of Rubicon Project nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw, qualify or modify, in each case in a manner adverse to Telaria, the

without qualification the Rubicon Project Board Recommendation within ten (10)
Business Days of Rubicon ProjectÂ’s written request to do so (or, if earlier,
at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Rubicon Project StockholdersÂ’
Meeting) following the public announcement of any Rubicon Project Alternative
Transaction; _provided_ , that Telaria shall not be entitled to make such
written request, and the Board of Directors of Rubicon Project shall not be
required to make such reaffirmation, more than once with respect to any
particular Rubicon Project Alternative Transaction unless the proposal in
respect of such Rubicon Project Alternative Transaction is subsequently
publicly modified in any material respect in which case Telaria may make such
request once each time such modification is made (any action or failure to act
in _clauses (i)_ through _(vi)_ being referred to as a " _Rubicon Project
Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that,
prior to obtaining the Rubicon Project Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of Rubicon Project determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that it has
received a Rubicon Project Superior Proposal that was not solicited,
initiated, knowingly encouraged or facilitated in violation of  _Section_ __
_ 5.3(a)_, the Board of Directors of Rubicon Project may effect a Rubicon
Project Recommendation Change (other than under _clause (ii)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ if it would include entering into an agreement with
respect to any Rubicon Project Alternative Transaction) if, but only if, (A)
the Board of Directors of Rubicon Project determines

 



59

    

 in good faith, after consultation with outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, (B) Rubicon
Project has notified Telaria in writing that it intends to effect a Rubicon
Project Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ (other
than under _clause (ii)_ of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ if it would

Alternative Transaction), (C) Rubicon Project has provided Telaria with, or
publicly disclosed, a copy of the proposed definitive agreements and other
proposed transaction documentation between Rubicon Project and the Person
making such Rubicon Project Superior Proposal, and the identity of the Person

Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to _clause (B)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_, Rubicon Project shall have discussed and negotiated
in good faith and made Rubicon ProjectÂ’s Representatives available to discuss
and negotiate in good faith (in each case to the extent Telaria desires to
negotiate) with TelariaÂ’s Representatives any proposed modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement so that the Rubicon Project Superior Proposal no longer
constitutes a Rubicon Project Superior Proposal (it being understood and
agreed that Telaria shall provide written notice to Rubicon Project of any
amendment to any material term or condition of any Telaria Superior Proposal
and the time period set forth in this _clause (D)_ shall be extended to the
later to occur of (I) two (2) Business Days following delivery of such
new notice from Telaria to Rubicon Project and (II) the expiration of the
original four (4)-Business Day period described in this _clause (D)_ ), and
(E) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the Board of Directors
of Rubicon Project shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and after
considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement, that (x) the Rubicon Project Alternative Transaction that is the
subject of the notice described in _clause (B)_ above still constitutes a
Rubicon Project Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action
would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.
Neither the Board of Directors of Rubicon Project nor any committee thereof
shall cause or permit Rubicon Project or any of its controlled Affiliates to
enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other agreement in respect of a Rubicon Project Alternative
Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section_
__ _ 5.3(a)_).

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of Rubicon Project set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_, Rubicon Project shall
promptly, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt thereof,
advise Telaria in writing of any request for information or proposal relating
to a Rubicon Project Alternative Transaction, the material terms and
conditions of such request or proposal (including any changes thereto) and the
identity of the Person making such request or proposal. Rubicon Project shall
(i) keep Telaria reasonably informed of the status and details (including
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or proposal on a
reasonably current basis and (ii) provide to Telaria as soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence
and other written materials received from the Person making such request or
proposal or any of its Representatives, in each case that describes or
contains any such request or proposal.

 

(d) Other than in connection with a Rubicon Project Superior Proposal
(which shall be subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ and shall not be subject
to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_), prior to obtaining the Rubicon Project
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of Rubicon Project may, in
response to a Rubicon Project Intervening Event, take any action prohibited
by _clauses_

Directors of Rubicon Project determines in good faith, after consultation with

take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law if, but only if, (i) Rubicon Project has notified Telaria in
writing that it intends to effect a Rubicon Project Recommendation Change
(under _clauses (i)_ or _(iii)_ of _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_) pursuant to this

of four (4) Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause
(i) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_, Rubicon Project shall have discussed and
negotiated in good faith and made Rubicon ProjectÂ’s Representatives available
to discuss and negotiate in good faith (in each case to the extent Telaria
desires to negotiate) with TelariaÂ’s Representatives any
proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood and agreed
that Rubicon Project shall provide Telaria with written notice of any material
change to the relevant facts and circumstances and the time period set forth

Business Days following delivery of such subsequent notice from Rubicon
Project to Telaria and (B) the expiration of the original four (4)-Business
Day period described above in this _clause (ii)_ ), and (iii) no earlier than
the end of such negotiation period, the Board of Directors of Rubicon Project
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and after considering the terms
of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that the failure
to take such action would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law. The term " _Rubicon Project Intervening Event_ " means a
material event or circumstance that was not known or reasonably foreseeable to
any of the directors or officers of Rubicon Project on the date of this
Agreement (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the consequences of which
were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors of Rubicon
Project as of the date of this Agreement), which event or circumstance, or
any consequence thereof, becomes known to the Board of Directors of Rubicon
Project prior to the Rubicon Project Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that
in no event shall any inquiry, offer or proposal that constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Rubicon Project Alternative Transaction
constitute a Rubicon Project Intervening Event; _provided_ _further,_ in no
event shall any of the following, either alone or in combination, constitute a
Rubicon Project Intervening Event: (1) any change in and of itself in the
market price or trading volume of the securities of Telaria or (it being
understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such
change may constitute or be taken into account in determining whether there

reasonable good faith judgment of such party, (i) any Applicable Law requires
such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such

result in the loss of attorney-client privilege, attorney work product or
other relevant legal privilege; _provided_ , further, that, with respect to

representation or warranty given by the other party hereto. Any information
provided or made available pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ shall be

substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or

benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors

conflicts of laws thereof.

 

Section 9.9. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,

CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER

Section 9.10. _Specific Enforcement_. The parties acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached, and that monetary

 



87

    

 damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 9.11_, without proof of actual damages (and
each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach.

 

Section 9.11. _Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that
any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
brought by any party or its Affiliates against any other party or its
Affiliates shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, _provided_ , that if (and only if) such court finds it
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then any such legal action or proceeding
may be brought in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or if
(and only if) each of such Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware
and such federal court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any other
Delaware state court. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its
property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of the parties agrees not to commence any action,
suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the courts described above in
Delaware, other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce
any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as
described herein. Each of the parties further agrees that notice as provided
herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and the parties further
waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein for any reason,
(b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i)
the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii)
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by
such courts.

 

Section 9.12. _Headings, etc_. The headings, table of contents and index
of defined terms contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only
and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

 

Section 9.13. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives
its rights under this _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ with respect thereto. Upon a
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or

 



88

    

 incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated
hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 9.14. _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of Rubicon
Project, Merger Sub and Telaria acknowledges that each party to this
Agreement has been represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of
law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed
ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no application
and is expressly waived.
