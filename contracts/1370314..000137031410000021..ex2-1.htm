RECITALS:

  

  

WHEREAS, the Company Board has (i) approved, and declared advisable, this
Agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company
(the "Merger") in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, (ii) approved the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations
hereunder and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company
Stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL; and

  

  

WHEREAS, each of the board of directors of Parent and the board of directors
of Merger Sub have (i) approved, and declared advisable, this Agreement
providing for the Merger and (ii) approved the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, performance of their respective covenants and other obligations
hereunder and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein; and

  

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to the Company's willingness to enter into this Agreement,
Thoma Cressey Fund VIII, L.P. (the "Guarantor") has entered into a limited
guarantee, dated as of the date hereof and in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A (the "Guarantee"), in favor of the Company with respect to the
obligations and liabilities of Parent and Merger Sub arising under, or in
connection with, this Agreement upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein and therein.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally bound, Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I 
 

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

1.1 The Merger

  

  

. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
the applicable provisions of the DGCL, on the Closing Date, Merger Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

  

  

thereupon cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of
the Merger. The Company, in its capacity as the surviving corporation of the
Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation."

 

  

  

1.2 The Effective Time

  

  

. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on
the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the Merger to
be consummated under the DGCL by filing a certificate of merger in customary
form and substance (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary of State") in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (the time of such filing with the
Delaware Secretary of State, or such later time as may be agreed in writing by
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger,
being referred to herein as the "Effective Time").

  

  

1.3 The Closing

  

  

. The consummation of the Merger shall take place at a closing (the "Closing")
to occur at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 300 North LaSalle St.,
Chicago, IL 60654, on the first (1st) Business Day after the satisfaction or
waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of the conditions set forth in
Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted hereunder), of such conditions), or at such other location,
date and time as Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall mutually agree upon
in writing. The date upon which the Closing shall actually occur pursuant
hereto is referred to herein as the "Closing Date".

  

  

1.4 Effect of the Merger

  

  

. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time all of the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

1.5 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws

  

.

  

  

(a) Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, subject to the
provisions of Section 5.10(a), the certificate of incorporation of the Company
(the "Certificate of Incorporation") shall be amended and restated in its
entirety to read identically to the form of the certificate of incorporation
attached hereto as Exhibit B, and, as so amended and restated, shall become
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and such
certificate of incorporation.

  

  

(b) Bylaws. At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of Section
5.10(a), the bylaws of the Company shall be amended to be identical to the
bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and, as so amended, shall become the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
(except that, for the avoidance of doubt, the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be Double-Take Software, Inc.) until thereafter amended in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

1.6 Directors and Officers.

  

  

(a) Directors. The directors of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of Surviving Corporation immediately
after the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

  

  

(b) Officers. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed.

  

  

1.7 Effect on Capital Stock

  

.

this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of any
of the following securities, the following shall occur:

  

  

(i) each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares and
Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and extinguished and automatically
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $10.55 (the
"Per Share Price"), without interest thereon;

  

  

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is held by the Company as
treasury stock or owned by Parent or Merger Sub, or by any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, in each case immediately
prior to the Effective Time ("Owned Company Shares"), shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefore;
and

  

  

(iii) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into one thousand validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (which shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation shall be deemed not to be outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time for purposes of this Agreement), and
thereupon each certificate representing ownership of such shares of common
stock of Merger Sub shall thereafter represent ownership of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) Adjustment to Per Share Price. The Per Share Price shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock, but excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, the granting or other issuance of Company RSU Awards and Company
Options in accordance with this Agreement), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

  

  

Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time, in each case which is effected in accordance with or other
permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

 

  

  

(c) Dissenting Shares.

  

  

(i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, other
than Section 1.7(c)(ii), any shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder
who has properly exercised appraisal rights for such shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively
withdrawn or lost or failed to perfect such appraisal rights ("Dissenting
Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Per
Share Price pursuant to Section 1.7(a), but instead shall be converted into
the right to receive only such consideration as may be determined to be due
with respect to such Dissenting Shares under the DGCL. From and after the
Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to
exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of an equity owner of the
Surviving Company or of a stockholder of Parent.

  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.7(c)(i) if any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock who demands appraisal for such shares in
accordance with the DGCL shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure
to perfect or otherwise) the right to dissent, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder\'s shares shall
no longer be Dissenting Shares and shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the Per Share Price as set forth in
Section 1.7(a), without any interest thereon.

  

  

(iii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal rights of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company which relate to any such demand for appraisal rights
and (B) the opportunity to participate in and control (with the participation
of the Company) all negotiations and proceedings that take place prior to the
Effective Time with respect to demands for appraisal rights under the DGCL;
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, prior to the Effective Time Parent
shall not have the authority to cause the Company to commit to or incur any
obligations with respect to any demands for appraisal rights. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal rights of Company Common Stock or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.

  

  

(d) Company Stock-based Awards.

  

  

(i) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company RSU Award, whether or
not vested, shall be canceled and, other than the Specified RSU Awards,
converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, an amount
(subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the product of
(x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Per Share Price (the
"RSU Consideration"). Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay to
holders of Company RSU Awards (other than holders of the Specified RSU Awards)
the RSU Consideration, without interest thereon, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

  

  

with respect to such payments pursuant to this Section 1.7(d), as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time.

 

  

  

(ii) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company Option, whether or
not vested, shall be cancelled, and (A) in the case of any Company Option
having a per share exercise price less than the Per Share Price, be converted
into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation for each share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, an amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash
equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y)
the amount by which the Per Share Price exceeds the per share exercise price
of such Company Option (the "Option Consideration"), or (B) in the case of any
Company Option having a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the
Per Share Price, without the payment of cash or issuance of other securities
in respect thereof. Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay to
holders of Company Options the Option Consideration, without interest thereon,
less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payments
pursuant to this Section 1.7(d), as soon as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time.

  

  

(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable
efforts to take such actions as may be necessary to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Section 1.7(d), including by delivering to
the holders of Company RSU Awards and the holders of Company Options notices,
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, setting forth such
holders' rights pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

1.8 Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent
for the Merger (the "Payment Agent").

  

  

(b) Exchange Fund. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this Article I, an amount
of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which holders of Company
Common Stock become entitled under this Article I (but not, for the avoidance
of doubt, payments that holders of Company RSU Awards and holders of Company
Options become entitled, which Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, in
accordance with Section 1.7(d)), assuming no Dissenting Shares. Until
disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not permit such cash to be invested
by the Payment Agent (such cash being referred to herein as the "Exchange
Fund"). Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund, which shall be in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be payable to the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

(c) Payment Procedures. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of
record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or
certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

  

  

Common Stock and (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Uncertificated Shares") (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Payment Agent), and/or (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Price
payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this Article I. Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate, by (y) the Per Share Price (less any
applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and the Certificates
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Upon receipt of an "agent's
message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer
of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such holder's transferred Uncertificated Shares,
by (y) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in
respect thereof), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates
and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest
shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price payable upon the surrender of
such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.8.
Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall
be deemed from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to
receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon, payable in respect
thereof pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

 

  

  

(d) Transfers of Ownership. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name
other than that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered
in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of
the Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered is
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such
Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender
and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any
agent designated by Parent) or the Surviving Corporation any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares,
or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by
Parent) that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not
payable.

  

  

(e) Required Withholding. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash amounts
payable

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

  

  

pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock, Company RSU Awards and Company Options such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under U.S. federal or state,
local or non-U.S. Tax laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

  

  

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

  

(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to the Surviving Corporation. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon
demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore
surrendered their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such
shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 1.8 shall thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable
in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws), as general
creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Per Share Price to which
such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions of this Article I.

  

  

1.9 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock

  

  

. From and after the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and
cease to exist, and each holder of Uncertificated Shares or a Certificate
theretofore representing any shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per
Share Price payable therefor in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.7.
The Per Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of this Article I shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of the Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to
reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

  

  

1.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates

  

  

. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Payment Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 1.7; provided, however, that Parent may, in its sole discretion and as
a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the
owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

  

  

bond in such reasonable sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

 

  

  

1.11 Necessary Further Actions

  

  

. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger
Sub, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause its directors and
officers to take all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action
is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

  

  

ARTICLE II

  


 

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

  

Except (i) as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent on the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), or
(ii) as disclosed in any Company SEC Reports filed by the Company with the
SEC, and publicly available, on or after December 31, 2008 and prior to the
date hereof (to the extent it is reasonably apparent that any such disclosure
set forth in the Company SEC Reports would, on its face, qualify the
representations and warranties contained herein, and excluding any matters
required to be disclosed for purposes of Section 2.7 (Company Capitalization),
Section 2.9 (Company SEC Reports), Section 2.12(b) (Absence of Certain
Changes) and Section 2.16 (Intellectual Property) of this Agreement, which
matters shall be specifically disclosed in Sections 2.7, 2.9, 2.12(b) and 2.16
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, respectively, and further excluding from
the Company SEC Reports (1) any items included therein that are incorporated
by reference to Company Reports filed prior to December 31, 2008 and (2) any
risk factor disclosures or other cautionary, predictive or forward-looking
disclosures contained therein), the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  

  

2.1 Organization; Good Standing

  

  

. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under Delaware Law, and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted and to
own, lease or operate its properties and assets. The Company is duly qualified
to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities
make such qualification necessary (to the extent the "good standing" concept
is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States),
except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of the Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws of the Company, each as amended
to date. The Company is not in material violation of the Certificate of
Incorporation or its bylaws.

  

  

2.2 Corporate Power; Enforceability

  

  

. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its covenants and obligations hereunder
and, subject to receiving the Requisite Stockholder Approval, to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

  

  

consummate the Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder and the consummation of the Merger have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no additional
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance
by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder or, subject to the
receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger
Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability (a) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditors' rights generally, and (b) is subject to the rules governing the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
remedies and general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law.

 

  

  

2.3 Company Board Approval; Fairness Opinion; Anti-Takeover Laws

  

  

. The Company Board has (i) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and
the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, (ii) approved the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and
obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and
conditions contained set forth herein and (iii) resolved to recommend that the
Company Stockholders approve the Merger in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL (the "Company Board Recommendation").

  

  

2.4 Requisite Stockholder Approval

  

  

. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock (the "Requisite Stockholder Approval") is the only
vote of the holders of any class or series of Company Capital Stock that is
necessary under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation and the
Company's bylaws to consummate the Merger.

  

  

2.5 Non-Contravention

  

  

. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance
by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder and the consummation
of the Merger, subject to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, do not
and will not (i) violate or conflict with any provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii) violate, conflict with, or result
in the breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or
lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or result in the
termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a
right of termination or acceleration under, any Material Contract, (iii)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 2.6, violate or
conflict with any material law or order applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective properties or assets are
bound, or (iv) result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties
or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of
each of clauses (ii) and (iv) above, for such violations, conflicts, defaults,
terminations, accelerations or Liens that would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

2.6 Requisite Governmental Approvals

  

  

. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, filing or registration
with, or notification to (any of the foregoing being referred to herein as a
"Consent"), any Governmental Authority is required on the part of the Company
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder or the consummation of the Merger, except (i) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, (ii) such filings
and approvals as may be required by any federal or state securities laws,
including compliance with any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act,
(iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any
applicable foreign Antitrust Laws, and (iv) such additional Consents the
failure of which to make or obtain would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

  

2.7 Company Capitalization.

  

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 130,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) 20,000,000 shares of Company
Preferred Stock. As of the close of business on May 13, 2010 (the
"Capitalization Date"): (A) 21,162,565 shares of Company Common Stock were
issued and outstanding, (B) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued
and outstanding, and (C) there were no shares of Company Capital Stock held by
the Company as treasury shares. All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
are validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of any preemptive
rights. Since the close of business on the Capitalization Date, the Company
has not issued any shares of Company Capital Stock other than pursuant to the
exercise of Stock Options granted under a Company Stock Plan and pursuant to
Company RSU Awards.

  

  

(b) The Company has reserved 8,940,815 shares of Company Common Stock for
issuance under the Company Stock Plans, of which 3,698,199 shares of Company
Common Stock have been reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding grants
under Company Stock Plans. As of the close of business on the Capitalization
Date, there were outstanding Company RSU Awards related to 589,699 shares of
Company Common Stock and outstanding Company Options to purchase 3,108,500
shares of Company Common Stock, and, since such date, the Company has not
granted, committed to grant or otherwise created or assumed any obligation
with respect to any Company RSU Awards or Company Options other than as
permitted by this Agreement. All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
have been, and all shares that may be issued pursuant to any Company Stock
Plan will be, when issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof,
duly authorized and validly issued and are (or, in the case of shares that
have not yet been issued, will be) fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. The copies of the Company Stock Plans that are filed as
exhibits to the Company SEC Reports are complete and correct copies thereof as
in effect on the date hereof. Section 2.7(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of the holders of outstanding Company RSU Awards or
Company Options as of the Capitalization Date, including (to the extent
applicable) the date on which each such Company RSU Award or Company Option
was granted, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option, the expiration date of such Company RSU Award or Company
Option, and the price at which such Company Option may be exercised.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 2.7, as of the date hereof there are
(i) no outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interest in, the Company (other than as a result of the vesting of the Company
RSU Awards for 589,699 shares of Company Common Stock and exercise of the
Company Options to purchase 3,108,500 shares of Company Common Stock, each as
set forth in Section 2.7(b)), (ii) no outstanding securities of the Company
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interest in, the Company, (iii) no outstanding options,
warrants or other rights or arrangements to acquire from the Company, or that
obligates or commits the Company to issue, any capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interest in, or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interest in, the Company, (iv) no obligations of the Company to grant, extend
or enter into any subscription, warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable
security or other similar Contract relating to any capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interest (including any voting debt) in, the Company, (v) no
outstanding restricted shares, restricted share units, stock appreciation
rights, performance shares, contingent value rights, "phantom" stock or
similar securities or rights that are derivative of, or provide economic
benefits based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price of, any capital
stock of, or other voting securities or ownership interests in, the Company
(the items in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), together with the
capital stock of the Company, being referred to collectively as "Company
Securities"), (vi) no voting trusts, proxies or other similar agreements or
understandings to which Company is a party or by which the Company is bound
with respect to the voting of any shares of capital stock of the Company,
(vii) no obligations or commitments of any character restricting the transfer
of any shares of capital stock of the Company to which the Company is bound,
and (viii) no other obligations by the Company to make any payments based on
the price or value of any Company Securities. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to any Contract that obligates the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company
Securities, other than the Company's right to withhold shares of Company
Common Stock in connection with the vesting or exercise of Company Stock-Based
Awards. There are no accrued and unpaid dividends with respect to any
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company.

  

  

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any Contract
currently in force relating to the voting of, requiring registration of, or
granting any preemptive rights, anti-dilutive rights, co-sale rights, or
rights of first refusal or other similar rights with respect to any securities
of the Company.

  

  

2.8 Subsidiaries.

  

  

(a) Section 2.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and
accurate list of the name, jurisdiction of organization and capitalization of
each Subsidiary of the Company. Each of the Subsidiaries of the Company is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its respective organization (to the extent the "good standing"
concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United
States). Each of the Subsidiaries of the Company has the requisite corporate
power and authority to carry on its respective business as it is presently
being conducted and to own, lease or operate its respective properties and
assets. Each of the Subsidiaries of the Company is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of
its properties owned

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

  

  

or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary
(to the extent the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any
jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered or
made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws or other constituent documents, as amended to date,
of each of the Subsidiaries of the Company. None of the Subsidiaries of the
Company is in material violation of its certificate of incorporation, bylaws
or other constituent documents.

 

  

  

(b) All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interest in, each Subsidiary of the Company (i) have been duly authorized,
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and (ii) is owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company, free and clear of all Liens and free
of any other restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell
or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity or voting interest)
that would prevent any Subsidiary of the Company from conducting its business
as of the Effective Time in substantially the same manner such businesses are
conducted on the date hereof.

  

  

2.9 Company SEC Reports.

  

  

(a) Since January 1, 2007, the Company has filed all forms, reports and
documents with the SEC that have been required to be filed by it under
applicable laws prior to the date hereof (all such forms, reports and
documents, together with all exhibits and schedules thereto, the "Company SEC
Reports"). Each Company SEC Report complied as of its filing date, or as of
its last date of amendment, in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
each as in effect on the date such Company SEC Report was filed. True and
correct copies of all Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof have
been furnished to Parent or are publicly available in the Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) database of the SEC. The Company has
made available (including via the EDGAR system, as applicable) to Parent all
material correspondence (if such correspondence has occurred since December
31, 2008) between the SEC on the one hand, and the Company and any of the its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand. As of the date hereof, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters from the SEC staff with
respect to any of the Company SEC Reports. To the Knowledge of the Company, as
of the date hereof, none of the Company SEC Reports is the subject of ongoing
SEC review, outstanding SEC comment or outstanding SEC investigation. As of
its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of
this Agreement, on the date of such amended or superseded filing), each
Company SEC Report did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. None of the Company's Subsidiaries is required
to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.

  

  

(b) The Company\'s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
made all certifications required by Rules 13a 14 and 15d 14 under the Exchange
Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act with respect to the
applicable Company SEC

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

  

  

Reports filed prior to the date hereof (collectively, the "Certifications")
and the statements contained in such Certifications are accurate in all
material respects as of the filing thereof.

 

  

  

2.10 Company Financial Statements.

  

  

(a) The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
filed with the Company SEC Reports (i) complied, as of their respective filing
dates with the SEC, in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, (ii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
during the periods and at the dates involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto or as otherwise permitted by Form 10-Q with respect to any
financial statements filed on Form 10-Q), and (iii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements to normal and recurring year-end adjustments). There are
no unconsolidated Subsidiaries of the Company.

  

  

(b) The Company has established and maintains, adheres to and enforces a
system of internal accounting controls that is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Since January 1, 2007,
neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Company's
independent auditors, has identified or been made aware of (A) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls
utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case which has not been
subsequently remediated, or (B) any fraud (whether or not material) that
involves the Company's management or other employees who have a role in the
preparation of financial statements or the internal accounting controls
utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of
the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that information relating to the Company,
including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in the
reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is made known to
the Company\'s Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the
Company by others within those entities. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting the Company's Chief Executive
Officer and its Chief Financial Officer to material information required to be
included in the Company's periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

  

  

(c) The Company is, and since enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has been, in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  

  

2.11 No Undisclosed Liabilities

notes thereto) of the Company in the Company SEC Reports, (b) liabilities
arising under this Agreement or incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (c) liabilities arising under executory

conducted, in all material respects, in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice, and there has not been or occurred (a) any Company Material
Adverse Effect or (b) any action that, if taken during the period from the
date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach
of Sections 4.2(a), 4.2(b), 4.2(d), 4.2(e), 4.2(f), 4.2(h)(iii), 4.2(i),
4.2(j), 4.2(l), 4.2(n), 4.2(p), 4.2(r), or 4.2(t).

be limited by

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

  

  

  

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other

The Company and its Subsidiaries are in possession of and have good title to,
or valid leasehold interests in or valid rights under contract to use, the
Assets that are material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

Subsidiaries uses or occupies or has the right to use or occupy, now or in the
future, any real property in excess of 10,000 square feet (such property, the
"Leased Real Property"). The Company and/or its Subsidiaries enjoy peaceful
and undisturbed possession under all such leases and there are no existing
defaults by the Company beyond any applicable grace period under such leases.
The Leased Real Property identified in Section 2.15(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and subject to the Leases comprises all of the material
real property used in the Company's business. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has complied with the terms of all Leases, and all Leases are in
full force and effect, except for such non compliances or failures to be in
full force and effect that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has made available to Parent and Merger Sub a true and complete copy of each
Lease document. No security deposit or portion thereof deposited with respect
any Lease has been applied in respect of a breach or default under any Lease
which has not been redeposited in full. The other party to each of the Leases

employees who create, develop or modify (or who created, developed or
modified) any Company Intellectual Property for the Company or its
Subsidiaries, to execute a confidentiality and assignment agreement prior to,
or concurrently with, commencement of their respective employment or
engagement with the Company. With respect to employees, such confidentiality
and assignment agreements have been substantially in the standard forms
previously provided to Parent by counsel to the Company in correspondence
which designated such agreements as standard forms. Section 2.16(k)(ii) of the

Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, partners, members,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents or other representatives
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any of the Other Required
Company Filings will not, at the time the applicable Other Required Company
Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub
with respect to information supplied by the Company or any of its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents or other representatives for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any of the Other
Required Company Filings.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.7 Section 203

  

  

. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their
"Affiliates" or "Associates" is, and at no time during the last three years
has been, an "Interested Stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203
of the DGCL.

  

  

3.8 Brokers

  

  

. No agent, broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage,
finder's or other fee or commission payable by the Company in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made
by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

  

  

3.9 Operations of Merger Sub

  

  

. Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated hereby and, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub
will not have engaged in any other business activities and will have incurred
no liabilities or obligations other than as contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

3.10 Financing.

  

  

(a) Parent has provided the Company with true and complete copies of the
commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, from Jefferies Finance LLC
(the "Commitment Letter"), regarding the amounts set forth therein for the
purposes of financing the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and related fees and expenses (the "Financing").

  

  

(b) The Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified, and the
commitments set forth in the Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. The Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered to
the Company on the date hereof, is in full force and effect and constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub and, to the
knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto for so long as it remains in
full force and effect, (i) except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting or
relating to creditors' rights generally and (ii) subject to the rules
governing the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other
equitable remedies and general principles of equity, regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter.
Assuming the Financing Commitment is funded, Parent and Merger Sub will have
at and after the Closing funds sufficient to make all payments contemplated by
this Agreement in connection with the Merger (including payment of all amounts
payable under Article I of this Agreement in connection with or as a result of
the Merger) and to pay all fees and expenses associated therewith. As of the
date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub under any term or condition of the Commitment Letter
other than to the extent that any term or condition requires any action by, or
otherwise relates to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. As of the date
of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe
that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the
Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the date of the
Closing. Parent and/or Merger Sub have fully paid any and all commitment and
other fees that have been incurred and are due and payable on or prior to the
date hereof in

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

  

  

connection with the Commitment Letter. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent's
and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not contingent on Parent's and Merger Sub's
ability to obtain any financing prior to consummating the Merger.

 

  

  

(c) As of the date hereof, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates is a party to any Contracts, or has made or entered into
any formal or informal arrangements or other understandings (whether or not
binding), with any Person (including any Company Stockholder, director,
officer or employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries) concerning any
investments to be made in, or contributions to be made to, Parent or Merger
Sub in connection with the Merger and/or any other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement other than as set forth in the Commitment Letters.

  

  

3.11 Management Arrangements

  

  

. As of the date hereof, except as previously disclosed to the Company Board,
there are no Contracts or any formal or informal arrangements or other
understandings (whether or not binding) between Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any director or officer of
the Company, on the other hand, relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including as to any
investments to be made in, or contributions to be made to, Parent or Merger
Sub), or to the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, businesses
or operations (including as to continuing employment) from and after the
Closing.

  

  

3.12 Solvency

  

  

. Assuming in all respects the truth and accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in Article II hereof, as of the Effective Time and
immediately after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger and the payment of the aggregate merger
consideration pursuant hereto, and payment of all related fees and expenses of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries in
connection therewith, (i) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the
assets of each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will exceed
(A) the value of all liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and such
Subsidiaries, including contingent and other liabilities, and (B) the amount
that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of the Surviving
Corporation and such Subsidiaries on their existing debts (including
contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured, (ii) each
of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged, and (iii) each of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will be able to pay its liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of
the foregoing, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged"
and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities,
as they mature" means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash
from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof,
to meet its obligations as they become due.

  

  

3.13 No Other Company Representations or Warranties

  

  

. Except for the representations and warranties set forth in Article II,
Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) neither the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective Affiliates,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or
advisors, nor any other

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

  

  

Person, has made or is making any other express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective business or operations, including with respect to any information
provided or made available to the Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents,
representatives or advisors, or any other Person, and (b) neither the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, nor or any of their respective Affiliates,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or
advisors, nor any other Person, will have or be subject to any liability or
indemnification obligation or other obligation of any kind or nature to
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors, or any
other Person, resulting from the delivery, dissemination or any other
distribution to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or
advisors, or any other Person, or the use by Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents, representatives or advisors, or any other Person, of any such
information provided or made available to any of them by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors, or any
other Person, including any information, documents, estimates, projections,
forecasts or other forward-looking information, business plans or other
material provided or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents,
representatives or advisors, or any other Person, in "data rooms,"
confidential information memoranda or management presentations in anticipation
or contemplation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 3.13 shall
relieve any Person of liability for fraud or intentional misconduct.

 

  

  

3.14 Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-
Looking Statements and Business Plans

  

  

. In connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company by Parent
and Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors, Parent and Merger
Sub and their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, representatives and advisors have received and may continue
to receive after the date hereof (including, without limitation, pursuant to
Section 5.8 of this Agreement) from the Company and its Affiliates,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and
advisors certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding the
Company and its business and operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby
acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as
well as in such business plans, and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no
claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents,
representatives or advisors, or any other Person, with respect thereto.
Accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge and agree that none of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective
Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents,
representatives or advisors, nor any other Person, has made or is making any
express or implied representation or warranty with respect to such estimates,
projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

  

  

business plans). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 3.14
shall relieve any Person of liability for fraud or intentional misconduct.

cause their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,

information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub), in

announcement of, or to encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition

Contract contemplating an Acquisition Transaction (other than an Acceptable

such Persons' Representatives) and / or (B) furnish any non-public information

the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public
information, or to the personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to any Person (and/or such
Persons' Representatives), in each case that has made or delivered to the
Company a written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that
was not initiated or solicited in breach of Section 4.3(a) if and only if, in
the case of clause (B) above, prior to providing such information or access,
the Company has received from such Person requesting such information,
discussions or access an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement;
provided that the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
make available to Parent any material information concerning the Company and
its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Person that was not previously
made available to Parent, and provided, further, that prior to taking any
action described in clauses (A) or (B) of this Section 4.3(b) above:

  

  

(i) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to
do so would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary obligations under
applicable laws; and

  

  

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

  

  

Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably
likely to result in a Superior Proposal.

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 4.3 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, (x) the Company Board may (whether or not it has
received a Superior Proposal) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change and
/ or (y) if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
from any Person that is not withdrawn and that the Company Board concludes in
good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may authorize
the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, if and only if:

  

  

(i) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure
to do so would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary obligations under
applicable laws;

  

  

(ii) the Company, in the case of clause (y) above, shall have complied with
its obligations under this Section 4.3 (other than any immaterial or
inadvertent breaches thereof that would not be reasonably expected to result
in an Acquisition Proposal);

  

  

(iii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least
three (3) Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period"), to the effect that
the Company Board is prepared absent any revision to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change and/or to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.3(c), which notice shall
describe the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change or
termination, including, in the case of clause (y) above, the identity of the
party making the Superior Proposal and the material terms and conditions
thereof;

  

  

(iv) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or
termination, the Company shall, and shall cause their financial and legal
advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
attempt to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
proposed by Parent, so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to
constitute a Superior Proposal or so as to obviate the need for the Company
Board to make a Company Board Recommendation Change, as applicable; provided,
that in the event of any material revisions to the Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall
be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the
requirements of this Section 4.3 (including this Section 4.3(c)) with respect
to such new written notice; and

  

  

(v) in the case of any action described in clause (y) of Section 4.3(c) above,
the Company shall, substantially concurrently therewith, terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(h), including making payment of the
Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.3(b)(iii).

  

  

(d) The Company will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent
after (i) receipt of an Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of the
Person making

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

  

  

such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal), (ii) any request for information relating to the
Company (including non-public information) or for access to the properties,
books or records of the Company by any third party that has made an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) receipt of an amendment to a previously
disclosed Acquisition Proposal (including the terms of such amendment). The
Company shall within 48 hours inform Parent of any change in the price,
structure or form of consideration or material terms and conditions of such

(whether or not binding) with any Person, or have any discussions or other
communications with any other Person, in any such case with respect to any
actual or potential Acquisition Proposal involving the Company.

  

  

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub agree that each of
Thomas Weisel Partners LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated qualify as an independent financial advisor to the Company for
all purposes of this Agreement.

5.3 Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings.

  

  

(a) As soon as practicable following the date hereof (and in any event the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to do so within fifteen (15)
calendar days), the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, a preliminary
Proxy Statement for use in connection with the solicitation of proxies from
the Company Stockholders for use at the Company Stockholder Meeting. If the
Company determines that it is required to file with the SEC any Other Required
Company Filing under applicable law, the Company shall promptly prepare and
file with the SEC such Other Required Company Filing within a reasonable
amount of time. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement and any Other
Required Company Filing to comply as to form and substance in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of
the SEC and Nasdaq. Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish all information
concerning the Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable) as the Company may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement and any Other
Required Company Filing. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder
Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any
of their respective partners, members, stockholders, directors, officers or
other Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be, so that the Proxy
Statement or Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be, would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the applicable
Other Required Company Filing describing such information shall be promptly
prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable law
or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

  

  

(b) Subject to applicable law, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Company
Stockholders as promptly as practicable following the filing thereof with the
SEC and confirmation from the SEC that it will not comment on, or that it has
no additional comments on, the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company
Filing (the date of such confirmation, the "SEC Clearance Date"). If the SEC
has failed to affirmatively notify the Company within ten (10) days after the
filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC that it will not be reviewing the
Proxy Statement, then the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such confirmation from the SEC

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

  

  

that it will not comment on, or that it has no additional comments on, the
Proxy Statement and the date on which the Company receives such confirmation
shall be the SEC Clearance Date.

 

  

  

(c) Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Company Board
Recommendation Change pursuant to the terms of Section 5.5(a), (i) the Company
and its Affiliates shall not file with the SEC the Proxy Statement or any
Other Required Company Filing or any amendment or supplement thereto, and (ii)
the Company and its Affiliates shall not correspond or otherwise communicate
with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or any Other
Required Company Filing in any such case referenced in the preceding clause
(i) or (ii) without providing Parent and Merger Sub a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment thereon.

  

  

(d) Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Company Board
Recommendation Change pursuant to the terms of Section 5.5(a), the Company
shall advise Parent and Merger Sub, promptly after the Company receives notice
thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for an amendment
or revisions to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, any
receipt of comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement or any
Other Required Company Filing, or any receipt of a request by the SEC or its
staff for additional information in connection therewith.

  

  

(e) Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Company Board
Recommendation Change in accordance with the terms of Section 5.5(a), the
Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement
and, if applicable, any Other Required Company Filings.

  

  

5.4 Company Stockholder Meeting.

  

  

(a) The Company shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
the Company Stockholders (or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the
"Company Stockholder Meeting") as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the date hereof (and in any event, subject to the immediately following
proviso, no later than forty-five (45) calendar days immediately following the
SEC Clearance Date; provided, however, nothing herein shall prevent the
Company from postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting if (i)
there are holders of insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock present
or represented by a proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a
quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting, (ii) the Company is required to
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable law, order
or a request from the SEC or its staff, (iii) the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
a failure to so delay the Company Stockholder Meeting would be reasonably
likely to violate the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law or (iv)
a failure to so delay the Company Stockholder Meeting would be reasonably
likely to violate applicable duties of disclosure or other applicable
disclosure requirements under applicable law.

  

  

(b) The Company shall establish a record date for purposes of determining the
Company Stockholders entitled to notice of and vote at the Company Stockholder
Meeting (the "Record Date"). Once the Company has established the Record Date,
the Company shall not

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

  

  

change such Record Date or establish a different record date for the Company
Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, unless
required to do so by applicable law or in the event that the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that a failure to do so would be reasonably likely to violate the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law. In the event that the date
of the Company Stockholder Meeting as originally called is for any reason
adjourned or postponed or otherwise delayed, the Company agrees that unless
Parent shall have otherwise approved in writing, it shall implement such
adjournment or postponement or other delay in such a way that the Company does
not establish a new Record Date for the Company Stockholder Meeting, as so
adjourned, postponed or delayed, except as required by applicable law or in
the event the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that doing so would be reasonably
likely to violate the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law.

 

  

  

(c) Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Company Board
Recommendation Change pursuant to the terms of Section 5.5(a), the Company
shall solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the approval
of the Merger in accordance with Delaware Law, submit the Merger for approval
of the Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to secure the Requisite Stockholder Vote at
the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall, upon the reasonable
request of Parent, advise Parent at least on a daily basis on each of the last
ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
as to the aggregate tally of the proxies received by the Company with respect
to the Requisite Stockholder Vote. Without the prior written consent of
Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Merger) shall be the only matter (other than procedure
matters) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Company
Stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting. Notwithstanding any Company
Board Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to, and in accordance with Article VII, this Agreement shall be
submitted to the Company Stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Vote.

  

  

5.5 Company Board Recommendation.

  

  

(a) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent or the Merger Sub,
the Company Board Recommendation with respect to the Merger, (ii) adopt,
approve or recommend or propose to adopt, approve or recommend (publicly or
otherwise) an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) after the receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal, fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within
ten (10) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing (provided that
Parent may make such request no more than once with respect to any such
Acquisition Proposal) or (iv) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (i) through (iv), a (a
"Company Board Recommendation Change"); provided, however, that a "stop, look
and listen" communication by the Company Board or any authorized committee
thereof to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange
Act, or any substantially similar communication, shall not be deemed to be a
Company Board Recommendation Change; and provided further, that
notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

  

  

Agreement (including the provisions of Section 4.3 or Section 5.1), at any
time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in accordance with
Section 4.3(c).

 

  

  

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board or any
authorized committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders that the
Company Board or any authorized committee thereof shall have determined to
make in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, however,
that, in either such case, any such statement(s) or disclosures made by the
Company Board or any authorized committee thereof shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the provisions of Article
II.

  

  

5.6 Financing.

  

  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letter (or terms not materially less favorable to Parent or the
Company (including with respect to the conditionality thereof)), including (i)
maintaining in effect the Commitment Letter and negotiating definitive
agreements with respect to the Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions
set forth in the Commitment Letter (or on terms not materially less favorable
to Parent or Merger Sub than the terms and conditions in the Commitment
Letter), (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent
and Merger Sub set forth in such definitive agreements that are within their
reasonable control, and (iii) consummating the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter at or prior to the Closing (and in any event prior to the
Termination Date). In the event that all conditions in the Commitment Letter
have been satisfied or, upon funding will be satisfied, Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause such lenders and the
other Persons providing such Financing to fund on the Closing Date the
Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter.
Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall amend, alter, or waive, or agree to amend,
alter or waive (in any case whether by action or inaction), any term of the
Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of the Company if such
amendment, alteration or waiver reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing
or amends the conditions precedent to the Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing Date or make the
funding of the Financing less likely to occur.

  

  

(b) Until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Article VII and the Effective Time, the Company shall (and the Company
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) provide, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives, to cooperate
with Parent and the Financing Sources to provide financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
requested by Parent or the Financing Sources; provided that (i) the Company
shall not be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or to incur
any other liability in connection

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

  

  

with the Financing, except following the Effective Time, (ii) such cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company.

 

  

  

5.7 Anti-Takeover Laws

  

  

. In the event that any Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

5.8 Access

  

  

. Until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article VII and the Effective Time:

  

  

(a) The Company shall afford Parent and its financial advisors, business
consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable prior notice
provided to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
to the properties, books and records and personnel of the Company as Parent
may reasonably request; provided, however, that the Company may restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that
(A) any applicable law or regulation requires the Company to restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information, (B) access to such
documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege
applicable to such documents or information, or (C) access to a Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound
would violate or cause a default under, or give a third party the right to
terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract; provided that, the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to design and implement
alternative procedures to enable Parent to evaluate any such documents or
information without causing a violation, loss of privilege, breach or default
thereunder or giving any third party a right to terminate or accelerate the
rights thereunder). Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this Section 5.8(a)(i) shall be conducted in a manner that
does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any
property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any access to
the Company's properties shall be subject to the Company's reasonable security
measures and insurance requirements and shall not include the right to perform
invasive testing. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement
shall apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its financial
advisors, business consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents
and representatives in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to
the access contemplated by this Section 5.8(a)(i). No investigation pursuant
to this Section 5.8(a)(i) shall affect any representation or warranty in this
Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the
parties hereto.

  

  

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish to
Parent, to the extent prepared by the Company in the ordinary course of
business, as soon as practicable after the end of each month, a copy of the
monthly internally prepared financial statements of the Company, including
statements of financial condition, results of operations,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

  

  

and statements of cash flow, and all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request.

 

  

  

5.9 Section 16(b) Exemption

  

  

. The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

  

5.10 Directors' and Officers' Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and
all indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any of their respective current or former directors and officers and any
person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Persons"). In
addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other
similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set
forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, and during such six-year period such provisions shall not be repealed,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable
law.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 5.10(a),
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or
pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged
action or omission in such Indemnified Person's capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action
or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time), or (ii) any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Indemnified Person delivers to Parent or the Surviving Corporation a written
notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this Section 5.10(b), then
the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In
the event of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) the
Surviving Corporation

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

  

  

shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time
if, and only if, it receives the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Person to do so (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense
thereof, subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 5.10(b), the
Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the
Indemnified Person's entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect
thereto), (ii) each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her
own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control
the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (iii) the
Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
promptly after statements therefor are received, whether or not the Surviving
Corporation elects to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry and (iv) no Indemnified Person shall be liable for
any settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 5.10(b) or
elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its
Affiliates (including Parent) shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any
claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be
sought by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry.

 

  

  

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the Company's
current directors' and officers' liability insurance ("DandO Insurance") in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance, on terms with respect to
the coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the DandO Insurance;
provided, however, that in satisfying its obligations under this Section
5.10(c), the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid by the
Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such three hundred percent
(300%) amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium") (which premiums the Company
represents and warrants to be as set forth in Section 5.10(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule); provided, however, that that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy for such year with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the
Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the
DandO Insurance at a cost per year covered for such tail policy not to exceed
the Maximum Annual Premium. In the event that the Company elects to purchase
such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such
"tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective
obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of the Surviving
Corporation (and Parent) under the first sentence of this Section 5.10(c) for
so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

  

  

(d) If the Surviving Corporation (or Parent) or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

  

  

all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation (or Parent) set forth in this Section 5.10.

 

  

  

(e) The obligations set forth in this Section 5.10 shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any
Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 5.10(c) (and their heirs
and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 5.10(c) (and their heirs
and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are
beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
Section 5.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third
party beneficiaries of this Section 5.10, with full rights of enforcement
against the Surviving Corporation (and Parent) as if a party thereto. The
rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries
under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 5.10(c)
(and their heirs and representatives)) under this Section 5.10 shall be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons
may have under the charters, bylaws or other equivalent organizational
documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable law (whether at law or in
equity).

  

  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.10 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

  

  

5.11 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide employees of the Company
with benefits and compensation that are comparable to those provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent ("Comparable Plans").

  

  

(b) To the extent that a Comparable Plan is made available to any Continuing
Employee on or following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause to be granted to
such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and, solely for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance pay, benefit entitlement, to the extent credited under an analogous
Employee Plan prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that such
service need not be credited under any equity-based or non-qualified deferred
compensation plan or arrangement or to the extent that it would result in
duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all employee
benefit plans sponsored by the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

  

  

Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Comparable Plans)
(such plans, collectively, the "New Plans") to the extent coverage under any
such New Plan replaces coverage in the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs under a Comparable Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old
Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving
Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all waiting
periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to
be waived in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent waived or
satisfied under the corresponding Old Plan as of the Effective Time, and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee's participation
in the corresponding New Plan begins in the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs to be given full credit under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time to the
extent reflected as a working capital liability on the Company's balance
sheet.

 

  

  

(c) No provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment
for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates to terminate, any Continuing Employee
at any time and for any or no reason, or (ii) require Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to continue any Continuing or Comparable Plan or prevent the
amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time, or
(iii) create any third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in any Person
(including any Continuing Employee or any dependent or beneficiary thereof)
other than the parties to this Agreement.

Subject to Section 7.3(g), the Company\'s receipt of payment of the Parent
Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(d) shall, (A) subject to
Section 7.3(g) and Section 8.8, be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company and its Affiliates against Parent, its Subsidiaries, the Financing
Sources and any of their respective former, current and future directors,
officers, employees, agents, general and limited partners, managers, members,
shareholders, Affiliates and assignees and any former, current or future
director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager,
member, shareholder, Affiliate and assignee of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the "Parent Parties") for any loss or damage suffered as a
result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder, under the Commitment Letter or otherwise and (B)
upon receipt by the Company of the amount of the Parent Termination Fee
(together with any amounts payable pursuant to Section 7.3(g)), none of the
Parent Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to Section
8.8, (1) neither the foregoing nor any other provision in this Agreement shall
be interpreted to limit the Company's remedies with respect to a dispute as to
the amount of the Parent Termination Fee payable pursuant to the definition
thereof, (2) under no circumstances will the Company be entitled to monetary
damages in excess of the amount of the Parent Termination Fee (together with
any amounts payable pursuant to Section 7.3(g)), (3) under no circumstances
will Parent be entitled to monetary damages in excess of the amount of the
Termination Fee and / or Parent Expenses, as applicable (together with any
amounts payable pursuant to Section 7.3(g)), and (4) while the Company may
pursue both a grant of specific performance and the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and all or any
portion of the Parent Termination Fee (but shall be entitled to receive any
amounts payable pursuant to Section 7.3(g)).

 

  

  

(g) Costs of Recovery. The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay
the amount due pursuant to Section 7.3(b) or Section 7.3(c) or Parent fails to
promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section 7.3(d), and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the amount set forth in Section 7.3(b) or Section 7.3(c) or any
portion thereof or a judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in
Section 7.3(d) or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent or
Merger Sub, on the one hand, or Parent shall pay to the Company, on the other
hand, (i) its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection
with such suit and (ii) interest on the amount payable pursuant to such
judgment at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date payment,
with such interest being payable in respect of the period from the date that
payment was originally required to be made pursuant to Section 7.3(b), Section
7.3(c) or Section 7.3(d) of this Agreement, as applicable, through the date of
payment.

8.5 Entire Agreement

  

  

. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among
the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the
Company Disclosure Schedule, constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to

in accordance with its

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event
of (A) any breach or threatened breach by the Company of any of its covenants
or obligations set forth in this Agreement or (B) in the circumstances set
forth in the following sentence, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and the Guarantee by the other (as applicable) and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other under this Agreement and the Guarantee.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including this
Section 8.8(b), the Company shall only be entitled to seek specific
performance to cause Parent to consummate the Merger in the event that (i)
Parent and Merger Sub are required to complete the Closing pursuant to Section
1.3 (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions that have not been satisfied
as a result of Parent or Merger Sub's breach or failure to perform any of
their respective covenants in this Agreement), (ii) the Financing (or any
alternative financing obtained pursuant to Section 5.6) is available to be
funded at Closing, (iii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing in
accordance with Section 1.03 and (iv) the Company has irrevocably committed
that it is willing to complete the Closing if specific performance is granted
to cause Parent to consummate the Merger and the Financing is funded.

  

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and the Guarantee by the
other parties hereto (as applicable) and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and the Guarantee to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the parties under this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that
(x) by the Company's seeking the remedies provided for in Section 8.8(b), it
shall not in any respect waive its right to seek payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, and (y) nothing set forth in this Section 8.8(b) shall
require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any party's
right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section
8.8(b) prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
Article VII, nor shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to
Section 8.8(b) or anything set forth in this Section 8.8(b) restrict or limit
any party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
Article VII or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement or the Guarantee
that may be available then or thereafter. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent or retrain breaches or threatened of this Agreement or
to enforce by specific performance the terms and provisions of this Agreement
or the Guarantee shall not be required to provide any bond or other security
in connection with any such order or injunction.

law, and nothing in this Section 8.10 shall affect the right of any party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable law, (b)

and assets in any action or proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction
of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom
located within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court of

or federal court within the State of Delaware) in the event any dispute or
controversy arises out of this Agreement or the Guarantee or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect thereof, (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, (d) agrees that any actions or proceedings arising in

the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom located

declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court within the State of Delaware), (e) waives any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such
court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court
and agrees not to plead or claim the same and (f) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or the Guarantee, or the

the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or
support any proceeding, suit, litigation, investigation, action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or
the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof).

party or parties hereto contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant

waiver affects(directly or indirectly) the interests or benefits of any of the
Financing Sources, unless each applicable Financing Source shall have

Delaware corporation, HA Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and the Guaranteed Party, pursuant
to which Merger Sub has agreed to merge with and into the Guaranteed Party
(the "Merger"), with the Guaranteed Party surviving the Merger as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein
shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

  

  

1. LIMITED GUARANTEE. To induce the Guaranteed Party to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Guarantor, intending to be legally bound, hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to be responsible for and guarantee the due and punctual performance by Parent and Merger Sub of, and to cause Parent and Merger Sub to perform, all of their obligations under the Merger Agreement that are to be performed by Parent or Merger Sub on or prior to the Effective Time (the "Obligations"), provided that the maximum aggregate liability of Guarantor hereunder shall not in any event exceed the amount of the Parent Termination Fee (the "Cap"), it being understood that in no event shall this Limited Guarantee be enforced without giving effect to the Cap. In addition to the Guaranteed Party\'s other rights under this Limited Guarantee and the Merger Agreement, if Parent becomes obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee and does not do so in full within the time provided in the Merger Agreement, Guarantor will pay the Parent Termination Fee within five Business Days after the date Parent should have paid the Parent Termination Fee. The obligation of Guarantor pursuant to this Limited Guarantee shall terminate and be of no further force or effect immediately upon the earlier of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) three (3) months following any termination of the Merger Agreement; provided that this Limited Guarantee shall not so terminate as to any claim for which notice has been given to Guarantor (which notice shall be deemed given upon notice to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to the Merger Agreement) prior to termination of Guarantor's obligation pursuant to this Limited Guarantee until final resolution and payment in full of such claim. All payments hereunder shall be made in lawful money of the United States, in immediately available funds. The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against the Guarantor to enforce this Limited Guarantee whether or not any other Person is joined as a party thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Guarantor agrees to pay on demand all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Guaranteed Party in connection with the enforcement of its rights hereunder if the Guarantor fails or refuses to make any payment to the Guaranteed Party hereunder when due and payable and it is judicially determined that the Guarantor is required to make such payment hereunder.

  

  

  

2. NATURE OF GUARANTEE. The Guaranteed Party shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Obligations in the event that Parent or Merger Sub become subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of the Guaranteed Party to so file shall not affect the Guarantor's obligations hereunder. In the event that any payment to the Guaranteed Party is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, the 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to the Obligations as if
such payment had not been made (subject to the terms hereof).

  

  

  

3. CHANGES IN OBLIGATIONS, CERTAIN WAIVERS.

  

  

  

a) The Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Party may, in it sole discretion,
at any time and from time to time, without notice to or further consent of the
Guarantor, extend the time of payment or performance of the Obligations, and
may also make any agreement with the Parent or Merger Sub for the extension or
renewal thereof, in whole or in part, without in any way impairing or
affecting the Guarantor's obligations under this Limited Guarantee or
affecting the validity or enforceability of this Limited Guarantee. The
Guarantor agrees that the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be
released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the
failure of the Guaranteed Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce
any right or remedy against Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person
interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) any
change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Obligations or
any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or
modification of any of the terms or provisions of the Merger Agreement made in
accordance with the terms thereof (other than with respect to the amount of
the Parent Termination Fee) or any agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise
executed in connection with any of the Obligations; (iii) the addition,
substitution or release of any Person interested in the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (iv) any change in the corporate
existence, structure or ownership of the Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;
(v) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding
affecting the Parent or Merger Sub; (vi) the lack of enforceability of the
Merger Agreement or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto (in
each case against any Person other than the Guaranteed Party); (vii) the
existence of any claim, set-off or other right that the Guarantor may have at
any time against the Parent, Merger Sub or the Guaranteed Party, or any of
their Affiliates, whether in connection with the Obligations or otherwise; or
(viii) the adequacy of any means the Guaranteed Party may have of obtaining
payment related to the Obligations. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the Guarantor hereby expressly waives any rights and defenses
arising by reason of any applicable Law that would otherwise require any
election of remedies by the Guaranteed Party. The Guarantor waives promptness,
diligence, notice of the acceptance of this Limited Guarantee and of the
Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance,
default, dishonor and protest, notice of any Obligations incurred and all
other notices of any kind, all defenses that may be available by virtue of any
valuation, stay, moratorium Law or other similar Law now or hereafter in
effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of the Parent or Merger
Sub or any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, and all suretyship and guarantor defenses generally. The
Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect
benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and that
the waivers set forth in this Limited Guarantee are knowingly made in
contemplated of such benefits. The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or
hereafter acquire against Parent or Merger Sub that arise from the existence,
payment, performance or enforcement of the Obligations under or in respect of
this Limited Guarantee or any other agreement in connection therewith,
including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement,
exoneration, contribution or indemnification prior to the termination of this
Limited Guarantee. The Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

  

  

is shall not assert, directly or indirectly, in any proceeding that this
Limited Guarantee is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in accordance with its
terms.

 

  

  

  

b) The Guaranteed Party hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not
institute, and shall cause its respective Affiliates not to institute, any
proceeding or bring any other claim arising under, or in connection with, the
Merger Agreement, the transactions contemplated thereby or otherwise relating
thereto, against any of the former, current and future equity holders,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates,
members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees of the Guarantor
or any former, current or future stockholder, controlling person, director,
officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate,
agent or assignee of any of the foregoing (those persons and entities
described in any of the foregoing clauses, each being referred to as a "Non-
Recourse Party"), except for claims against the Guarantor under this Limited
Guarantee and against the Parent or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement.

  

  

  

4. NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE RIGHTS. No failure on the part of the Guaranteed Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Guaranteed Party of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to the Guaranteed Party or allowed it by law or agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by the Guaranteed Party at any time or from time to time. The Guaranteed Party shall not have any obligation to proceed at any time or in any manner against, or exhaust any or all of the Guaranteed Party's rights against Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person liable for any Obligations prior to proceeding against the Guarantor hereunder.

  

  

  

5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants and covenants that:

  

  

  

a) the execution, delivery and performance of this Limited Guarantee have been
