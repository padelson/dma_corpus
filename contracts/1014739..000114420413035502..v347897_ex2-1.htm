WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer desires to acquire and purchase from the Sellers, and the
Sellers desire to sell, transfer and assign to Buyer, the Assets (as defined

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants herein contained, and intending to
be legally bound, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

1D. _Excluded Liabilities_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Buyer shall not assume or be deemed to assume and shall

1G. _Closing Distributions_.

  



  

(i) At the Closing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set

1H. _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  



  

(i) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall prepare and deliver to the Representative (a) an unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Adjustment Calculation Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (b) a
statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the Buyer's calculation
of Closing Net Working Capital. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared
in accordance with the Accounting Principles. The Closing Statement shall be
derived from the Closing Balance Sheet, and shall be prepared in accordance
with the applicable definitions and other requirements set forth in this
Agreement and in a manner consistent with the example set forth in _Exhibit H_
attached hereto. During the sixty (60) days immediately following the
Representative's receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement and any period of dispute thereafter with respect thereto,
Buyer shall (x) assist the Representative in the review of the Closing
Balance Sheet and Closing Statement and provide the Representative and its
representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to the
books and records (including work papers), supporting data, employees and
accountants of the Business to the extent relevant to and for the sole
purpose of their review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement, and (y) reasonably cooperate with the Representative and its
representatives in connection with such review, including providing on a
timely basis all other information necessary in connection with the review of
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement as is requested by the
Representative or its representatives. The Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing
Statement and the resulting calculation of Closing Net Working Capital shall
become final and binding upon the parties hereto sixty (60) days following
the Representative's receipt thereof unless the Representative gives written
notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Buyer prior to
such date; _provided_ that the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement
and the resulting calculation of Closing Net Working Capital shall become
final and binding upon the parties hereto upon the Representative's delivery,
prior to the expiration of the sixty (60) day period, of written notice to
Buyer of its acceptance of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the
nature and amount of any disagreement and the Representative's alternative
calculation of the disputed amounts, in each case, together with reasonably
detailed supporting documentation to the extent the Representative has been
provided sufficient information to specify such matters.

  



  

(ii) If a timely Notice of Disagreement is received by Buyer, then
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (as revised in
accordance with this _Section 1H(ii)_), and the resulting calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital, shall become final and binding upon the parties
hereto on the earlier of (a) the date any and all matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement are finally resolved in writing by the Representative
and Buyer and (b) the date any and all matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement not resolved by the Representative and Buyer are finally
resolved in writing by the Arbiter (as defined below). The Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement shall be revised to the extent
necessary to reflect any resolution by the Representative and Buyer and any
final resolution made by the Arbiter in accordance with this _Section
1H(ii)_. During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery

  



    

3 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

of a Notice of Disagreement or such longer period as the Representative and
Buyer may agree in writing, the Representative and Buyer shall seek in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences which they may have with respect
to any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and all such
discussions related thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and the
Representative) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and
any applicable similar state rule. At the end of such thirty (30) day period
or such longer period as the Representative and Buyer may agree in writing,
the Representative and Buyer shall submit to McGladrey LLP (the " _Arbiter_
") for review and resolution of any and all matters (but only such matters)
which remain in dispute and which were included in the Notice of
Disagreement. Buyer and the Representative shall instruct the Arbiter to,
and the Arbiter shall, make a final determination of the items included in
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (to the extent such
amounts are in dispute) in accordance with Accounting Principles and
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and in a manner
consistent with the example set forth in _Exhibit H_ attached hereto. Buyer
and the Representative will cooperate with the Arbiter during the term of its
engagement. Buyer and the Representative shall instruct the Arbiter not to,
and the Arbiter shall not, assign a value to any item in dispute greater than
the greatest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the
Representative, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such
item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Representative, on the other
hand. Buyer and the Representative shall also instruct the Arbiter to,
and the Arbiter shall, make its determination based solely on submissions by
Buyer and the Representative that are in accordance with the guidelines and
procedures set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of an
independent review). The submissions must be made within fifteen (15) days of
engaging the Arbiter and copies of such submissions shall be provided to each
party. The Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the resulting
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital shall become final and binding on
the parties hereto on the date the Arbiter delivers its final resolution in
writing to Buyer and the Representative (which final resolution shall be
requested by the parties to be delivered not more than forty-five (45) days
following submission of such disputed matters), and such resolution by the
Arbiter shall not be subject to court review or otherwise appealable.
The fees and expenses of the Arbiter pursuant to this _Section 1H(ii)_ shall
be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the
Sellers), on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the aggregate
portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the
aggregate amount actually contested by such party.

  



  

(iii) If the Estimated Purchase Price is less than the Purchase Price
(such shortfall, the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), Buyer shall, within five (5)
Business Days after the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement become final and binding on the parties hereto pursuant to this
_Section 1H_ , make payment of the Shortfall Amount by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to, or as directed by, the Representative (for the
benefit of the Sellers).

  



  

(iv) If the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than the Purchase
Price (such excess, the " _Excess Amount_ "), Buyer and the Representative
shall deliver joint written instructions within five (5) Business Days
after the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement become final and
binding on the parties hereto pursuant to this _Section _

  



    

4 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

 _1H_ , to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to make payment to
Buyer, by wire transfer in immediately available funds of the Excess Amount
from the Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account.

  



  

(v) Buyer agrees that the working capital adjustment provided for in
this _Section 1H_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies for the matters
addressed or that could be addressed therein.

  



  

1I.   _Purchase Price Allocation_.

  



  

(i) Within thirty (30) days following the final determination of the
Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 1H_ , the Representative and the Buyer
shall mutually determine the allocation of the Purchase Price and the Assumed
Liabilities among the Assets, which allocation shall be based on the
methodology set forth on _Schedule 1I_.

  



  

(ii) Neither Buyer nor the Sellers, nor any of their respective
Affiliates, shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or
otherwise) which is inconsistent with the determinations made pursuant to
this _Section 1I_ unless required to do so by applicable Law.

  



  

1J. _Holdback Payment_. If and only if the Aggregate Actual Product
Gross Profit for Year 1 equals or exceeds the amount set forth on
_Schedule 1J_ , Buyer shall pay an amount equal to Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000) (the " _Holdback Amount_ ") to, or as directed by, the
Representative (for the benefit of the Sellers). The Buyer shall pay the
Holdback Amount to, or as directed by, the Representative (for the benefit of
the Sellers) within ninety (90) days after the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, or, if later, on the date that the applicable Holdback
Calculation become final in accordance with _Section 1K_. For the avoidance
of doubt, the parties hereto agree that no amount shall be payable under this
_Section 1J_ if Aggregate Actual Product Gross Profit does not equal or
exceed the amount set forth on _Schedule 1J_ during Year 1.

  



  

1K. _Holdback Determination_. Within forty-five (45) days after the
last day of Year 1, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Representative a
statement setting forth in reasonable detail the computation of the Aggregate
Actual Product Gross Profit for Year 1 (the " _Holdback Calculation_ "),
including all necessary back-up calculations. The Representative shall have
reasonable access to the employees of Buyer and its Subsidiaries and the
books and records and working papers relating to the Business for the
purpose of calculating or objecting to any Holdback Calculation. If the
Representative has any objections to the Holdback Calculation, the
Representative shall, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Holdback
Calculation or, if the Representative requests any books and records or
working papers within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the Holdback
Calculation, within thirty (30) days following the Representative's receipt
of the last of any requested materials, deliver to Buyer a statement setting
forth any objections to the Holdback Calculation (the " _Holdback Objections
Statement_ "). The Holdback Objections Statement shall set forth in
reasonable detail the basis for the items being disputed in good faith. The
Sellers hereby waive the right to assert any objection, other than
allegations of fraud, with respect to any Holdback Calculation that is not
asserted in the Holdback Objections Statement delivered to Buyer. If the
Holdback Objections Statement is not delivered to Buyer in accordance with
this _Section 1K_ , the Holdback Calculation shall be final and binding upon,
and

--- 

 


--- 

    



  

non-appealable by, the parties hereto. If the Representative delivers the
Holdback Objections Statement to Buyer in accordance with this _Section 1K_
, the Representative and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
such objections, but if they do not reach a final resolution within fifteen
(15) days after delivery of the Holdback Objections Statement, the
Representative or Buyer may at any time thereafter, with written notice to
the other party, submit such dispute to the Arbiter and such dispute shall be
resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in
_Section 1H_. The Representative and Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Arbiter to resolve all disagreements as
promptly as practicable. The Holdback Calculation reflecting the
resolution of the Dispute by the Arbiter shall be final and binding upon, and
non-appealable by, the parties hereto and may be entered as a final judgment
in any court of proper jurisdiction. The costs and expenses of the Arbiter
shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer, on the one hand, and fifty
percent (50%) by the Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), on the other
hand.

  



  

1L. _Operation of the Business During Year 1_. During Year 1, Buyer
shall and shall cause its designees, Subsidiaries and Affiliates to
(a) maintain separate books and records for the Business in a manner which
permits determination of the Aggregate Actual Product Gross Profit for the
Business; (b) deliver to the Company, within thirty (30) days after the end of
each fiscal quarter, a calculation of Aggregate Actual Product Gross Profit
for such fiscal quarter; (c) make a good faith, non-discriminatory effort to
conduct sales and service activities in the Acquired Branch business in the
ordinary course of Buyer's business with respect to all home infusion-branch
operations of Buyer; (d) not take or fail to take, any action with the purpose
of avoiding the obligation to make the Holdback Payment; and (e) not sell,
exchange, assign, or otherwise transfer to any Person substantially all of
the assets used in any Non-Overlapping Branch or Overlapping Acquired Branch.

  



  

1M. _Payments to the Representative on behalf of the Sellers_. Any
amounts which, pursuant to this Agreement, are to be paid, distributed or
released to, or as directed by, the Representative (for the benefit of the
Sellers) shall (subject to the Representative's rights pursuant to _Section
11O_ (including to set aside and retain additional funds paid to or received
by it, or to direct payment of additional funds to be paid to the Sellers
pursuant to this Agreement at Closing or thereafter) to satisfy any
Representative Expenses or potential Representative Expenses) be paid, or
directed to be paid, by the Representative to or on behalf of the Sellers as
determined by the Representative.

reasonable notice, to the personnel, properties, books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that are in the possession or under the control

particular agreement), the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all necessary waivers of confidentiality provisions in its

breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, or to satisfy any
condition. At any time, and from time to time on or prior to the Closing
Date, the Company may supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Letter (any
such supplement or amendment, a " _Disclosure Update_ "). No Disclosure

will not be deemed supplemented or amended by any fact or circumstance set
forth in a Disclosure Update which exists as of the Execution Date which such
matter was required to be set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter as of

the Sellers to be true as of the Execution Date and, accordingly, the Buyer

commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an early termination of the

the strategy and process by which the Parties will seek required approvals
under the HSR Act and the Antitrust Laws, and by which the Parties respond to
and resolve any objections or investigations by any Governmental Entity
pursuant to the HSR Act or the Antitrust Laws. In furtherance (but not
limitation) of the foregoing, the Owners and the Sellers shall not, without
the prior written consent of Buyer, enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Agency relating to such Governmental Agency's review or
investigation of this Agreement under the HSR Act or the Antitrust Laws.

  



  

(ii) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Buyer
will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete and file or submit, or
cause to be completed and filed or submitted, notices and filings with
Governmental Entities with respect to the Licenses and Permits and
accreditations as it deems appropriate. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in promptly
seeking to complete and file or submit such notices and filings, as requested
in writing by Buyer, including any notice of termination or withdrawal of
Sellers' Licenses and Permits. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company understands that any notices or filings will require
certain information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries; as such,
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide Buyer with any reasonably
requested assistance related to any regulatory filings that require
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including
without limitation, the assistance described on _Schedule 3H_. All

not apply to the Owners listed on _Schedule 8C_. Instead, the
restrictions set forth in the sections of the agreements identified in
_Schedule 8C_ shall apply with respect to the specified Owners for the time
period set forth in _Schedule 8C_. This _Section 8C_ and _Schedule 8C_ shall
have no effect on the application of the agreements specified in _Schedule

thereto, such agreements shall remain in full force and effect.

  



  

8D. _Modification_. If a court of competent jurisdiction should
declare the covenants contained in _Article 8_ unenforceable because of any
unreasonable restriction of activities, duration and/or geographical area,

express authority to reform the covenants to provide for reasonable
restrictions and/or grant Buyer such other relief at law or in equity
reasonably necessary to protect the interests of Buyer.

  



  

8E. _Injunctive Relief; Other_. Each Seller and each Owner
specifically agrees and acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this

contained herein will not result in unreasonable harm to either of them. Each
Seller and each Owner further acknowledges that a breach of any provision of
this _Article 8_ by him/her/it would cause Buyer to suffer immediate and
irreparable harm, which could not be remedied by the payment of money. In the
event of a breach or threatened breach by any Seller of the provisions of any
covenant contained in this _Article 8_ , Buyer shall be entitled to
injunctive relief to prevent or end such breach, without the requirement to
post bond, and recovery of costs (including attorneys' fees) to enforce the
covenant. Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting Buyer from
pursuing any other remedies available to it for such breach or such threatened
breach, including the recovery of damages.

when the applicable representation or warranty or covenant terminates
pursuant to _Section 10C(i)_ or _Section 10C(ii)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless with respect to Losses
arising prior to the applicable termination date shall not terminate
with respect to any item as to which the Person to be indemnified shall have,
prior to the applicable termination date, previously made a claim by
delivering a written notice (stating in reasonable detail the nature and
amount (if known) of, and factual and legal basis for, any such claim for
indemnification, and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such claim
for indemnification is made) to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with
this Agreement. No Indemnified Party shall have any right to assert any
claims pursuant to this _Article 10_ with respect to any Loss, cause of
action or other claim to the extent it is primarily a possible or potential
Loss, cause of action or claim that such party believes may be asserted rather
than a Loss, cause of action or claim that has, in fact, been filed of record
against such Indemnified Party or one of its Affiliates or paid or incurred by
such Indemnified Party or one of its Affiliates.

  



  

10F. _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

  



  

(i) In order for a Person that has rights of indemnification under
this Agreement (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of a claim or
demand made by any Person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third
Party Claim as promptly as reasonably possible after receipt by such
Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ that failure
to give such notification on a timely basis shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure;
_provided_ _further_ that, for purposes of making claims against the Escrow
Amount, written notice to the Representative shall be deemed written notice to
the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 10F(i)_. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within five
(5) Business Days after the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of
all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

  



  

(ii) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it elects, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so
long as (a) the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing
within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the
Third Party Claim of the Indemnifying Party's election to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim, (b) the Third Party Claim does not predominately
seek an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party,
(c) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the Third Party
Claim (1) is not, in the good faith, reasonable judgment of the Indemnified
Party, likely to establish a precedential custom or practice adverse to the
continuing business interests of the Indemnified Party or (2) in the good
faith, reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, would not reasonably be
expected to materially injure the Indemnified Party's reputation and future
business prospects, and (d) upon a petition by the Indemnified Party, a court
of

  



  

   

41 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

competent jurisdiction has not determined that the Indemnifying Party failed
to diligently prosecute or defend such Third Party Claim; _provided_ that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim relating to any Excluded
Liability.

  



  

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third Party
Claim in accordance with this _Section 10F_ , the Indemnified Party may
retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense (which costs and
expenses shall not be indemnifiable Losses hereunder) and participate in the
defense of the Third Party Claim subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to
control the defense thereof. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does
not assume and control the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall assume and control the defense of such Third Party
Claim and shall reasonably contest such Third Party Claim in good faith.

  



  

(iv) The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party unless such
settlement provides the Indemnified Party with a full and unconditional
release from such Third Party Claim. No Indemnifying Party shall admit or
permit to be admitted any fault, responsibility or liability on behalf of an
Indemnified Party without such Indemnified Party's consent, which consent may
be granted or withheld at Indemnified Party's sole discretion.

  



  

(v) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party
Claim, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the
Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

  



  

(vi) In the event that the Indemnifying Party has not elected to (or
is not able to by operation of _Section 10F(ii)_ ) assume control of the
defense, the Indemnified Party may defend against and shall reasonably contest
such Third Party Claim (and the Indemnified Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with, or obtain consent from, the Indemnifying
Party in connection therewith), but may not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be
unreasonably withheld). The Indemnifying Party will remain responsible for
any Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of,
relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim, in each
case, subject to the limitations provided in this Agreement.

  



  

10G. _Certain Additional Matters_.

  



  

(i) Any indemnification pursuant to this _Article 10_ shall be
effected (a) in the case of an indemnification claim resolved in favor of the
Seller Indemnified Parties, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
from Buyer to an account(s) designated in

  



  

   

42 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

writing by the Representative within thirty (30) days after the determination
thereof and (b) in the case of an indemnification claim resolved in favor of
any Buyer Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
from the Sellers to an account designated in writing by Buyer within thirty
(30) days after the determination thereof; _provided_ that any indemnification
owed by the Sellers to the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this _Article 10_
(other than pursuant to _Section 10A(ii)(b)_ ) shall first be satisfied out
of the Escrow Amount to the extent then available; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Escrow Amount shall not be available to satisfy any claims related
to breach of any covenant requiring performance after the Closing,
including the covenants contained in _Article 8_. Buyer and the
Representative shall promptly provide joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to make payment pursuant to the
preceding sentence if the Escrow Agent has not timely done so pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement. Thereafter, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have direct
recourse, on a joint and several basis, to the Sellers, subject to the terms
and limitations contained in this _Article 10_. If the net assets of
the Sellers readily available to satisfy any such indemnification claim are
insufficient to satisfy the claim in full or the Sellers do not pay such
indemnification claim within thirty (30) days after the final determination
thereof, then after a final determination that any Losses are payable to any
Buyer Indemnified Party hereunder, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have
direct recourse to the Owners to the extent of such shortfall on a separate
basis (and for the avoidance of doubt, not on a joint or several basis) for
such Owner's pro rata portion (based on the percentage of amounts received by
each Owner as reflected on _Exhibit I_ ), subject to the terms and
limitations contained in _Article 10_. Within five (5) Business Days after the
one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall,
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, release to, or as directed by,
the Representative an amount equal to the excess of (i) all remaining Escrow
Amounts in the Escrow Account, _minus_ (ii) the aggregate amount (the "
_Claim Amount_ ") for which claims for indemnification were made against the
Escrow Amount prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date and
not yet resolved. Furthermore, with respect to determinations made after the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, within five (5) Business Days after it
is determined that all or any portion of the Claim Amount is not owed to
Buyer hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, release to, or as directed by, the Representative such portion of
the Claim Amount. Buyer and the Representative shall promptly provide joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to take
the foregoing actions if the Escrow Agent has not timely done so pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(ii) The amount of any and all Losses under this _Article 10_ shall
be determined net of any amounts actually recovered by an Indemnified Party
or any of such Indemnified Party's Affiliates under or pursuant to any
insurance policy, title insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement
arrangement or contract, pursuant to which or under which such Indemnified
Party or such Indemnified Party's Affiliates is a party or has rights so long
as the insurer has no recourse against the Indemnified Party for amounts so
paid. Any Buyer Indemnified Party that may be entitled to indemnification
hereunder shall seek full recovery under any applicable insurance policy,
title insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement arrangement or contract, in
each case, included in the Assets with any third party that may cover a Loss
to the same extent as they would if such Loss

  



  

   

43 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

were not subject to indemnification or other recovery hereunder. In the event
that an insurance or other recovery is made by any Indemnified Party with
respect to any Loss for which any such Indemnified Party has been indemnified
or otherwise recovered hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate net
amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the Person providing the
indemnity or other recovery and if such recovery is made from the Escrow
Account, to the Representative. in either such case so long as the insurer has
no recourse against the Indemnified Party for amounts so paid. With respect
to any matter involving any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities and for
which Buyer has no right or good faith basis for asserting a claim for
indemnification against the Sellers and Owners under _Section 10A_ ,
then when and as requested by the Representative (on behalf of the Sellers)
and at the Sellers' sole cost and expense with respect to such matter, Buyer
shall cooperate with Sellers in making and pursuing a claim on behalf of
Sellers' against any insurance policy included in the Assets.

  



  

(iii) In no event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to recover
or make a claim for any amounts in respect of, and in no event shall "Losses"
be deemed to include, (a)(1) any consequential, punitive, incidental,
indirect, special or exemplary losses, liabilities, damages, or expenses, or
(2) any losses, liabilities damages or expenses for lost profits or diminution
in value or any "multiple of profits," "multiple of cash flow" or similar
valuation methodology used in calculating the amount of Losses, or (b) in the
case of Buyer, any loss, liability, damage or expense to the extent such item
was included in the calculation of the Purchase Price or Closing Net Working
Capital.

  



  

(iv) With respect to (a) any matter involving any Excluded Assets or
Excluded Liabilities and for which Buyer has no right or good faith basis for
asserting a claim for indemnification against the Sellers and Owners under
_Section 10A_ or (b) any matter for which Buyer has a right or good faith
basis for asserting a claim for indemnification (whether or not asserted)
against the Sellers and Owners under _Section 10A_ , then, when and as
requested by the Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) and at the
Sellers' sole cost and expense with respect to such matter, Buyer shall
either enforce rights to indemnification with respect to such matter under
any Assumed Contract relating to any of the Seller's prior acquisitions or, if
effective, reassign to the Sellers such rights under any such Assumed
Contract in order for the Sellers to enforce such rights. In the event that
the Representative makes a request pursuant to clause (b) above, then (1) the
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) shall pay to Buyer the amount
of any Losses to which Buyer is entitled under this Agreement,
notwithstanding _Section 10C(iii)_ and _Section 10C(iv)_ , then (2) the
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) shall be reimbursed for all losses,
costs and expenses (including legal fees), then (3) Buyer shall be entitled
to any remaining amounts.

  



  

(v) Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

disclosing party of such proposed communication. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, after the Closing, the WCP Owners, Buyer and their respective
Affiliates may provide information about the subject matter of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby in connection with any of their fund
raising, marketing, information and reporting activities. The provisions of
this _Section 11A_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

  



  

11B. _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(i) Buyer acknowledges that all information provided to it and its
respective Affiliates' agents and representatives by the Company, the Sellers
and their respective Affiliates, agents and representatives (including
pursuant to _Section 3A_) is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement between or on behalf of the Company and Buyer or one or more of
their respective Affiliates or other beneficial owners (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are hereby incorporated
herein by reference; _provided_ , _however_ , that following the Closing, the
limitations on the Buyer's use of the Sellers' confidential information shall
be of no force or effect but the Buyer shall maintain the confidentiality of
the information pertaining to the Owners.

  



  

(ii) From the date hereof until the second anniversary hereof, each
Seller and each Owner will treat and hold as confidential all of
Buyer's confidential information, refrain from disclosing any of Buyer's
confidential information except in connection with this Agreement and
destroy, at the written request and option of Buyer, all tangible embodiments
(and all copies) of any of Buyer's confidential information in such Seller's
or Owner's possession; _provided_ that any Seller or Owner may disclose the
terms of this Agreement to their respective employees, accountants, advisors
and other representatives as necessary in connection with the ordinary
conduct of their respective businesses. Each Seller and each Owner understands
that such Seller or Owner may be in possession of non-public information
about Buyer and agrees that such Seller or Owner will not knowingly purchase

other period of time in which information disclosed in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein may be reasonably deemed to constitute

information, which such period shall be deemed to extend no longer than
one year after the Closing. Each Seller and Owner acknowledges that, as a
result of such Seller's or Owner's association with the Business, such Seller
and Owner has acquired confidential and proprietary information of special

litigation, investigation or administrative proceeding. In the event that any
Seller or Owner is required (by oral question or request for information or
documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of Buyer's
confidential information, such Seller or Owner shall notify Buyer of the
requirement so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or waive

of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, any Seller or
Owner is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any of Buyer's
confidential information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt,
such Seller or Owner may disclose such confidential information to the
tribunal; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Seller or Owner shall use his,
her or its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the reasonable
request of Buyer and at Buyer's expense, an order or other assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of such confidential
information required to be disclosed as Buyer shall designate.
Buyer's confidential information shall not include any information which (y)
is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure by a Seller or an Owner in breach of this _Section 11B(ii)_ , or
(z) becomes available to a Seller or an Owner on a non confidential basis
from a source other than Buyer.

  



  

11C. _Cooperation_. From and after the Closing, Buyer, on the one
hand, and each of the Sellers and the Owners, on the other hand, shall execute
and deliver such further assignments, endorsements and instruments of
conveyance and transfer as may reasonably be necessary to further effectuate
the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement
to assign any Contract or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder
or resulting therefrom if and for so long as such assignment, without the
consent of a third party thereto, would constitute a breach or other
contravention of such Contract or in any way adversely affect the rights of
the Buyer or the Sellers thereunder. If such consent is not obtained, or if
an attempted assignment

  



  

   

46 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

thereof would be ineffective or would adversely affect the rights of any
Seller thereunder so that the Buyers would not in fact receive all such
rights, Buyer and each Seller will cooperate in a mutually agreeable
arrangement under which Buyer would obtain the benefits and perform and
discharge the obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, or
under which such Seller would enforce for the benefit of Buyer at Buyer's sole
cost and expense, with Buyer being responsible for the performance and
discharge of such Seller's obligations, any and all rights of the Sellers
against a third party.

  



  

11D. _Insurance_. The Sellers shall maintain in full force and
effect their policies of insurance until the Closing Date. The Company shall
purchase (it being understood and agreed that 50% of all amounts paid by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in connection with this _Section 11D_
on or prior to the Closing shall increase the Purchase Price) on or before the
Closing Date four year extended reporting endorsements ("tails") for any and
all policies of insurance maintained on a "claims made" basis and covering
any of the Sellers as of the date hereof with limits consistent with amounts
in effect as of the date hereof and will add Buyer as an additional insured
to said policies. The Company will provide a certificate of insurance
evidencing such tail policy to Buyer at the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company is under no obligation to maintain its policy(ies) of
director and officer liability insurance. If the Company elects to purchase a
tail for any policy(ies) of director and officer liability insurance
coverage, the Company shall purchase such coverage at its sole cost and
expense.

  



  

11E. _Benefit Matters_.

  



  

(i) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall (and shall cause to be

(ii) Prior to the Closing, (A) the board of managers of the Company
will have caused to be passed a resolution stating that the Company
401(k) Plan shall be terminated effective at least one (1) day prior to the
Closing but contingent on the occurrence of the Closing, and (B) the Company
shall not take any actions that would cause the Company 401(k) Plan to lose
its tax-qualified status. Within thirty (30) days of Closing, Buyer shall
permit all employees who were participants in or eligible to participate in
the Company 401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date to participate in a 401(k)
plan maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_
"). Prior to the Closing, the board of directors of Buyer will have caused to
be passed a resolution (a copy of which shall have been provided to Sellers)
stating that Buyer or designee of Buyer shall become the named fiduciary (as
determined under ERISA) of the Company 401(k) Plan following the Closing,
which resolution may also provide that Buyer may delegate such fiduciary
status to a designee to the extent permitted by applicable Laws. Buyer shall
further cause the Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept rollovers of distributions (or
direct rollovers) and outstanding participant loans from the Company 401(k)
Plan. Buyer shall administer, at

  



  

   

47 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Buyer's sole cost and expense, the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan in
compliance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws, and in
such a manner as to permit the distribution of loan promissory notes from the
Company 401(k) Plan and rollover of such promissory notes to the Buyer 401(k)
Plan without causing any default on a Company 401(k) Plan loan.

  



  

(iii) Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause to be granted to all
employees of Buyer or any of its Affiliates who were employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing credit
for all purposes (including eligibility, vesting, and accrual or
determination of amount of benefits) for their service with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing under any benefit or compensation
plan, program, agreement, contract or arrangement maintained by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates. Further, following the Closing, Buyer shall credit all
employees of Buyer or any of its Affiliates who were employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing with the amount
of their extended illness bank benefits in the amount set forth on _Schedule
11E(iii)_ and shall permit all such employees to utilize such benefits in
accordance with the terms of the policy of the Company and its Subsidiaries
that was in effect with respect to such benefits prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

11F. _Employees_.

  



  

(i) Buyer shall make an offer of employment to (i) each Employee
(including Employees on temporary leave of absence, including family
medical leave, military leave, short- or long-term , workers compensation, or
sick leave) (notwithstanding the terms of any other agreement between Buyer
or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and such Employee,
on the other hand) and (ii) each Person listed on _Schedule 11F_ , in each
case at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, or within five (5)
Business Days of the applicable date of hire with respect to any Employee
hired less than ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, which offers shall
include base salary not less than Employee's base salary as of the Execution
Date, subject to exceptions reasonably determined by Buyer in consultation
with the Sellers' CEO, which shall provide that employment with Buyer or one
of its Affiliates will commence effective as of the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any offer of employment shall be contingent upon the Closing
actually occurring. Nothing herein shall obligate Buyer to employ any
Employees for any specific time period. Nothing herein shall be construed to
grant any Employee any rights as a third party beneficiary. If any Employee
fails to meet Buyer's hiring standards, e.g., as a result of drug screening
or background check, or is a former employee of Buyer ineligible for re-
hiring, (a) Buyer will nevertheless offer employment to such individuals for
such minimum period as is necessary to permit eligibility for COBRA benefits
under Buyer's health benefit plans (other than any Assumed Seller Plan); (b)
such Employees will not be granted access to any Buyer systems; and (c) such
Employees will not be eligible for any severance from Buyer.

  



  

(ii) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company and each applicable
Owner shall terminate any existing employment agreement between them
and agree that any such employment agreements shall be of no further force or
effect after the Closing Date.

  



  

   

48 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Furthermore, the Company and each such Owner acknowledge and agree that all
rights and obligations under the specified employment agreements shall
cease as of the Closing Date, including any rights to compensation, severance
and other payments. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company and each of
Dana Soper, Steven Jones and Kenneth Kollmann shall terminate any existing
restrictive covenant agreement between them and agree that such restrictive
covenant agreements shall be of no further force or effect after the Closing
Date.

  



  

(iii) The Sellers shall cause their payroll agent(s) to process
payroll for all Employees for dates of service through the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date and shall pay out to all Employees the
value of any accrued paid time off, but for the avoidance of doubt, not
including any extended illness bank accruals described in _Section 11E(iii)_.

  



  

11G. _SEC Financial Statements and Auditor 's Consents_.

  



  

(i) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Buyer so that Buyer can obtain or prepare, within the
time periods required by applicable securities laws and regulations and
NASDAQ Global Market requirements, and in no event later than the Closing
Date, subject to _Section 11G(ii)_ , any audited and unaudited financial
statements relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and any pro forma or
other financial information (other than audited and unaudited financial
statements) relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries that the Buyer is
required to file with the SEC under applicable securities laws and
regulations, with such financial statements and financial information to be
prepared in accordance with such laws, regulations and
requirements (including unqualified audit reports) (such information, the "
_Required SEC Financial Statements_ "). Buyer shall notify the Company in
writing of (i) Buyer\'s determination of required SEC Financial Statements
under the significance tests of Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X, and (ii)
Buyer\'s non-exclusive summary of the adjustments (to the extent such
adjustments may require the Company\'s cooperation) to the Schedule 5D
Financial Statements that Buyer or Grant Thornton has determined necessary for
the SEC Financial Statements to be prepared in accordance with Regulation
S-X. In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts:

  



  

(a) provide to Buyer the Company's audited consolidated (A) balance
sheets for the Company and its Subsidiaries as of each of December 31, 2012,
2011 and 2010, and (B) related statements of earnings, cash flows and
stockholders' equity and, if applicable, statements of comprehensive income,
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2012, 2011 and 2010, accompanied by the report thereon by Grant Thornton, in
each case to the extent the foregoing would constitute Required SEC Financial
Statements (any such balance sheets, statements of earnings, changes in net
parent investment, cash flows, stockholders' equity, comprehensive income,
reports and opinions, collectively, the " _Audited Financial Statements_ ");

  



  

   

49 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) to request that Grant Thornton deliver an unqualified opinion
with respect to the Audited Financial Statements and providing to
Grant Thornton customary consent letters from the Company as are requested by
Grant Thornton in connection with delivering such opinion;

  



  

(c) to enter into engagement letters with Grant Thornton as
reasonably requested by Grant Thornton;

  



  

(d) to deliver unaudited consolidated balance sheets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2013, and the related unaudited
consolidated statements of operations and cash flows and, if applicable,
statements of comprehensive income of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
the three months ended March 31, 2013 (or for any subsequent interim period
completed after the date of this Agreement within sixty (60) days following
the end of any such interim period), which shall be prepared in
accordance with Regulation S-X, in each case to the extent the foregoing
would constitute Required SEC Financial Statements (the "
_Unaudited Financial Statements_ " and, together with the Audited Financial
Statements, the " _SEC Financial Statements_ "); and

  



  

(e) to deliver any other financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Business that would constitute Required SEC
Financial Statements; _provided_ that the foregoing does not include any
information with respect to any Owner.

  



  

(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in _Section 11G(i)_ , failure to deliver or provide the
information set forth in this _Section 11G_ prior to the Closing Date shall
not be deemed to be a breach of the obligations of the Company and the
Sellers hereunder and therefore, compliance with this _Section 11G_ shall not
constitute a condition to Closing pursuant to _Section 2B(i)_. The Sellers
and the Company hereby agree to consent to the inclusion of such SEC
Financial Statements and information in any filings by Buyer with any
securities regulatory authority or exchange. To the extent required following
the Closing Date, the Sellers and the Company further hereby agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts after the Closing Date (a) to request Grant
Thornton to provide to Buyer (or Buyer's successor) any such auditor's consent
to the inclusion of any such SEC Financial Statements or the information
contained therein, in any filings by or on behalf of Buyer (or
Buyer's successor) with any applicable securities regulatory authority or
securities exchange and (b) to request that Grant Thornton cooperate with
Buyer and its auditors in the preparation of the pro forma financial
statements required under Regulation S-X to reflect, among other things, the
elimination of the Excluded Assets and the Excluded Liabilities.

  



  

Buyer is solely responsible for and shall promptly reimburse the Company upon
written request including a copy of related Grant Thornton invoice for any
costs and expenses of the Company in complying with this _Section 11G_ (it
being understood and agreed that any amounts not reimbursed prior to the
Closing Date shall increase the Purchase Price).

its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly in connection with consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by fifty percent
(50%) by the Sellers, on the one hand, and fifty percent (50%) by the Buyer,
on the other hand, when due, regardless of whether such Taxes are technically
owed by the Sellers, Buyer, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and Buyer
will file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
all such Taxes, fees and charges, and if required by applicable Law, the
Sellers will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. The Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for fifty percent (50%) of
the costs of preparation of any such Tax Returns and similar documentation.

  



  

(ii) At the Closing, each Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a written
statement, in the form prescribed by Section 1.1445-2(b)(2) of the Treasury
Regulations, certifying under penalties of perjury that such Seller is not a
"foreign person" within the meaning of Section 1445 of the Code.

hundred eighty (180) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, whichever is later, Buyer shall preserve and retain all
corporate, accounting, Tax, legal, auditing or other books and records
relating to the conduct of the Business prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(ii) After the Closing Date and in the event that the Representative
has a reasonable business purpose related to the Excluded Assets,
the Excluded Liabilities, its obligations under this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to have access to the
materials referred to in this _Section 11K_ , Buyer shall permit the
Representative and its representatives, advisors, attorneys and accountants
to have reasonable access to, and if reasonable, to inspect and copy, at the
Representative's expense, that portion of the materials referred to in this
_Section 11K_ that the Representative needs access to, consistent with such
reasonable business purpose, and to meet with officers and employees of Buyer
on a mutually convenient basis in order to obtain explanations with respect
to such materials and to obtain additional information

  



  

   

51 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

and to call such officers and employees as witnesses (the cost of which shall
be borne by the Representative (on behalf of the Sellers)). The parties hereto
agree to cooperate so that such access does not unreasonably disrupt the
normal operations of Buyer.

  



  

11L. _Consents_. Buyer acknowledges that certain consents to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to
Contracts (including the Company Material Contracts) being assigned hereunder.
Nevertheless, Buyer acknowledges that such consents may not be obtained,
despite the Sellers' good faith efforts. Buyer agrees that no Seller shall
have any liability whatsoever to Buyer (and Buyer shall not be entitled to
assert any claims) arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
consents that may have been or may be required under any Contract in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of
the termination of or loss of right under any such Contract as a result
thereof. Buyer further agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of
the Sellers contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached solely as a
result of the failure to obtain any consent under a Contract.

Buyer (or its designees) the proceeds of any Accounts Receivable received by
the Sellers in respect of any Accounts Receivable and (ii) Buyer shall
promptly remit to the Representative (or its designees) the proceeds of any
Governmental Receivables. Further, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to facilitate an agreement between the Sellers and a third party
Person experienced in the collection of healthcare receivables pursuant to
which such third party would assist the Sellers in the collection of the
Governmental Receivables. For the avoidance of doubt, no party hereto may
offset or withhold any receivables received by such party that are required to
be paid to another party hereto pursuant to this _Section 11M_ , it being
acknowledged that the obligation to pay over receivables is absolute and
unconditional.

  



  

(ii) Following the Closing, Buyer shall (and shall cause its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries to), permit the Sellers and its representatives,
advisors, attorneys and accountants to have access to and make copies of the
following in Buyer's, its Affiliates' or its Subsidiaries' possession or

and its Affiliates' and Subsidiaries' personnel as shall be reasonably
necessary or appropriate in connection with such response, contest or defense,

diem or hourly charge derived from and no greater than the base salary of any
employee of Buyer performing such work.

  



  

11N. _Designation and Replacement of Representative_. The parties
hereto have agreed that it is desirable to designate the Representative
to act on behalf of the Sellers and the Owners for certain limited purposes,
as specified herein. The Sellers and the Owners have designated WCP Seller
Rep, LLC as the initial the Representative, and execution of this Agreement by
the Sellers and the Owners shall, to the maximum extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements, constitute irrevocable ratification and
approval of such designation by the Sellers and the Owners and authorization
of the Representative to serve in such capacity (including to settle any and
all disputes with Buyer under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement), and
shall also constitute a reaffirmation, approval, acceptance and adoption of,
and an agreement to comply with and perform, all of the acknowledgments and
agreements made by the Representative on behalf of the Sellers and the Owners
in this Agreement and the other documents delivered in connection herewith
(including the Escrow Agreement). The Representative may resign at any time
and the Representative may be removed only by the WCP Owners. The designation
of the Representative is coupled with an interest, and, except as set forth in
the immediately preceding sentence, such designation is irrevocable and shall
not be affected by the death, incapacity, illness, bankruptcy, dissolution or
other inability to act of any of the Sellers or Owners. In the event that the
Representative has resigned or been removed, a new Representative shall be
appointed by the WCP Owners, such appointment to become effective upon the
written acceptance thereof by the new Representative. Written notice of any
such resignation, removal or appointment of a Representative shall be
delivered by the Representative to Buyer promptly after such action is taken.

  



  

11O. _Authority and Rights of Representative; Limitations on
Liability_. The Representative shall have such powers and authority as are
necessary or appropriate to carry out the functions assigned to it under this
Agreement and in any other document delivered in connection herewith
(including the Escrow Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Representative will have no obligation to act on behalf of the Sellers or the
Owners. The Company, Buyer and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on
the actions taken by the Representative without independent inquiry into the
capacity of the Representative to so act. All actions, notices,
communications and determinations by the Representative to carry out such
functions shall conclusively be deemed to have been authorized by, and shall
be binding upon, the Sellers and the Owners. Neither the Representative nor
any of its officers, directors, managers, employees, agents or
representatives shall have any liability to the Sellers or the Owners with
respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Representative in such
capacity (or any of its officers, directors, managers, employees, agents or
representatives in connection therewith), except with respect to the
Representative's willful misconduct. The Representative will at all times be
entitled to rely on any directions received from the Company; provided,
however, that the Representative shall not be required to follow any such
direction, and shall be under no obligation to take any action in its capacity
as the Representative based upon any such direction. The Representative shall
be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other agents and
consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection with exercising its
powers and performing its function hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith
on the part of the Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on
the opinions and advice of such Persons. The Representative (for itself and
its officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and

  



  

   

53 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

representatives) shall be entitled to full reimbursement by the Sellers and
the Owners for all Representative Expenses and to full indemnification by the
Sellers and the Owners against any loss, liability or expenses arising out of
actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Representative
(except for those arising out of the Representative's gross negligence or
willful misconduct). In furtherance of the foregoing, the Representative
shall have the power and authority to set aside and retain additional funds
paid to or received by it, or direct payment of additional funds to be paid
to the Sellers or the Owners, as Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement at
Closing or thereafter, to satisfy such obligations (including to establish
such reserves as the Representative determines in good faith to be
appropriate for such Representative Expenses that are not then known or
determinable). The relationship created herein is not to be construed as a
joint venture or any form of partnership between or among the Representative
or any Seller or Owner for any purpose of U.S. federal or state law,
including federal or state income tax purposes. Neither the
Representative nor any of its Affiliates owes any fiduciary or other duty to
any Seller or Owner.

12A. _Amendment and Waiver_. The failure of any party to insist, in
any one or more instances, on performance of any of the terms and conditions

12C. _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned without the prior written consent of the Representative and Buyer;
provided, however, that Buyer may assign, without the prior written consent
of any other party hereto (whereupon Buyer shall provide written notice
thereof to the Sellers and the Owners), any of its rights, benefits or
obligations under this Agreement to an Affiliate; provided, however, that no
such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement;
provided, further, that, in the case of an assignment by Buyer to an
Affiliate, such assignment shall not be effective vis-a-vis the other parties
to this Agreement unless such Affiliate agrees in writing to assume the
obligations of Buyer under this Agreement on a joint and several basis with
Buyer.

  



  

12D. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Legal Requirements, but if any provision of this Agreement
is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision
shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity,
without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining
provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

12E. _No Strict Construction_. Notwithstanding the fact that this
Agreement has been drafted or prepared by one of the parties, each of Buyer,
the Sellers, the Owners and the Representative confirm that they and their
respective counsel have reviewed, negotiated and adopted this Agreement as
the joint agreement and understanding of the parties hereto and the language
used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the
parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any Person.

  



  

12F. _Captions_. The captions used in this Agreement and
descriptions of the Company Disclosure Letter are for convenience of
reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not
be deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this
Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced and
construed as if no caption or description of the Company Disclosure Letter
had been used in this Agreement.

  



  

12G. _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any other agreements
referred to herein or therein executed and delivered on or after the date
hereof, contain the complete agreement among the parties hereto and supersede
any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or between such
parties, written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof
in any way.

  



  

12H. _Company Disclosure Letter_. The disclosures in the Company
Disclosure Letter shall qualify the representations and warranties set forth
in the corresponding section or subsections of _Article 4_ and _Article 5_
 and any other representations and warranties set forth in _Article 4_ and
_Article 5_ if, and to the extent that, an appropriate cross reference is
contained in such section or subsection or it is readily apparent on the face
of such disclosure that it applies to such other section or subsection.
Certain sections of the Company Disclosure Letter contain disclosures
which include more information than is required by the applicable sections or

  



  

   

58 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

subsections of this Agreement to which such sections or subsections relate and
such additional disclosure shall not be deemed to mean that such information
is required by such sections or subsections of this Agreement (by way of
example, the fact that a section or subsection of this Agreement calls for a
listing of material agreements does not necessarily mean that such agreement
listed on the related section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter
is material). The inclusion of information in the Company Disclosure Letter
shall not be construed as or constitute an admission or agreement that a
violation, right of termination, default, liability or other obligation of
any kind exists with respect to any item, nor shall it be construed as or
constitute an admission or agreement that such information is material to the
any of the Sellers. In addition, matters reflected in the Company Disclosure
Letter are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be
reflected in the Company Disclosure Letter. Such additional matters are set
forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other
matters of a similar nature. Neither the specifications of any dollar amount
in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor
the inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter is
intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no Person shall use
the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such
item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether
any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the
Company Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. Further, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter is intended to
imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in
the ordinary course of business, and no Person shall use the fact of
setting forth or the inclusion of any such items or matter in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described herein or included in the Company Disclosure Letter is or is not
in the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

12I. _No Additional Representations; Disclaimer_.

  



  

(i) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that none of the Sellers or Owners
nor any of their respective Affiliates or representatives, nor any
other Person acting on behalf of the Sellers or the Owners or any of their
respective Affiliates or representatives has made any (and Buyer and its
Affiliates have not relied on any) representation or warranty, express or
implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries or the Business, except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement or as and to the extent required by this Agreement to be set
forth in the Company Disclosure Letter. Buyer further agrees that none of the
Sellers or Owners nor any of their respective direct or indirect Affiliates or
representatives will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer or any
other Person resulting from the distribution to Buyer, or Buyer's use of, any
such information, including the Confidential Information Memorandum prepared
by Harris Williams and Co. (the " _Information Memorandum_ "), and any
information, document or material made available to Buyer or its Affiliates or
representatives in certain "data rooms" and online "data sites," management
presentations or any other form in expectation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

   

59 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it is consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without reliance on any
representation or warranty, express or implied, by the Sellers, the Owners or
any of their respective Affiliates or representatives except for the
representations and warranties of the Sellers and Owners expressly set forth
in _Article 4_ and _Article 5_ hereof.

  



  

(iii) In connection with Buyer's investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, Buyer has received from or on behalf of the Sellers certain
projections, including projected statements of operating revenues and income
from operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and certain business plan
information of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Buyer acknowledges that there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections
and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer is familiar with such
uncertainties, that Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts), and
that Buyer shall have no claim against any Seller or Owner or any other Person
or any escrow amounts with respect thereto. Accordingly, the Sellers and the
Owners make no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and
forecasts), and Buyer has not relied thereon.

  



  

12J. _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement may be
executed in multiple counterparts (including by means of telecopied or
electronically transmitted signature pages), all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same Agreement. This Agreement and any signed
agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and
any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or electronic mail (any such delivery, an " _Electronic
Delivery_ "), shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding
legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person. At the request of any party hereto or to any such agreement or
instrument, each other party hereto or thereto shall re execute original
forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any
such agreement or instrument shall raise (a) the use of Electronic Delivery
to deliver a signature or (b) the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic
Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party
forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense related to
lack of authenticity.

  



  

12K. _Governing Law_. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction, validity and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  



  

12L. _CONSENT TO JURISDICTION_. SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF
_SECTION 1D_ (WHICH SHALL GOVERN ANY DISPUTE ARISING THEREUNDER), THE PARTIES
HERETO AGREE THAT JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN ANY SUIT, ACTION

OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY IN RESPECT OF THE INTERPRETATION AND
ENFORCEMENT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY RELATED AGREEMENT,
CERTIFICATE OR OTHER DOCUMENT DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH SHALL PROPERLY
AND EXCLUSIVELY LIE IN ANY FEDERAL OR STATE COURT LOCATED IN
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS. BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY
IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS FOR ITSELF AND IN
RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. THE
PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT VENUE WOULD BE PROPER IN SUCH COURT,
AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT ANY SUCH COURT IS AN IMPROPER OR
INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. THE
PARTIES HERETO FURTHER AGREE THAT THE MAILING BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED
MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, OF ANY PROCESS REQUIRED BY ANY SUCH COURT
SHALL CONSTITUTE VALID AND LAWFUL SERVICE OF PROCESS AGAINST THEM, WITHOUT
NECESSITY FOR SERVICE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PROVIDED BY STATUTE OR RULE OF COURT.

  



  

12M. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH
HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL OF
ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
OR (II) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF
THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION,
OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT
THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF
THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE
PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

  



  

12N. _Payments under Agreement_. Each party hereto agrees that all
amounts required to be paid hereunder shall be paid in United States currency
and, except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, without
discount, rebate or reduction and subject to no counterclaim or offset, on
the dates specified herein (with time being of the essence).

  



  

12O. _Third-Party Beneficiaries and Obligations_. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and permitted
assigns, any rights, remedies or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement, other than sections which are specifically for the benefit of
Persons expressly described or identified that are not parties hereto or
their respective successors and permitted assigns (including  _Section 1G_ ,
_Section 11O_ , _Section 11I_ , _Section 11J_, this _Section 12O_, and
_Section 12R_ ), each of which is intended to be for the benefit of the
Persons covered thereby or to be paid thereunder and may be enforced by such
Persons.

  



  

   

61

12P. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed by Buyer, the Sellers, or the Owners, as
applicable, in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached by Buyer, the Sellers, or the Owners, as applicable. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by any of Buyer,
the Sellers or the Owners, as applicable, and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof against Buyer, the Sellers or the Owners, as
applicable, in any court having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which the parties hereto are entitled at law or in equity.
Each party hereto hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy and further agrees that the only
permitted objection that it may raise in response to any action for
equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement.

  



  

12Q. _Prevailing Party_. In the event any litigation or other
court action, arbitration or similar adjudicatory proceeding (a "
_Proceeding_ ") is commenced or threatened by any party (the " _Claiming
Party_ ") hereto to enforce its rights under this Agreement against any other
party (the " _Defending Party_ "), if the Defending Party is the prevailing
party in such Proceeding, all fees, costs and expenses including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and court costs, incurred by the
Defending Party in such Proceeding shall be reimbursed by the Claiming Party;
provided, that if the Defending Party prevails in part, and loses in part, in
such Proceeding, the court, arbitrator or other adjudicator presiding over
such Proceeding shall award a reimbursement of the fees, costs and expenses
incurred by the Defending Party on an equitable basis. For purposes hereof,
and without limitation, the Defending Party shall be deemed to have prevailed
in any Proceeding described in the immediately preceding sentence if the
Claiming Party commences any such Proceeding and (i) such underlying claim(s)
are subsequently dropped or voluntarily dismissed without a negotiated
settlement, and/or (ii) the Defending Party defeats any such claim(s)
pursuant to an order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.

  



  

12R. _Lender Protection_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein (including _Section 12L_ and _Section 12M_  of this
Agreement), the parties hereto hereby agree (i) that any claim, suit, action
or proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving any Lead Arranger or
any Lender (each as defined in Buyer's Credit Agreement) or any Affiliate
thereof arising out of or relating to Buyer's Credit Agreement, including the
transactions, the facilities, the commitment letter, the fee letters, or the
performance of services thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of a state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan,
(ii) not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support
anyone else in bringing any such claim, suit, action or proceeding in any
other court, (iii) to waive any right to trial by jury in respect of any such
claim, suit, action or proceeding, (iv) that the Lead Arrangers and the
Lenders (and their respective Affiliates) are third party beneficiaries of any
liability cap or other limitation on remedies or damages in this Agreement,
and (v) that the Lead Arrangers and the Lenders (and their respective
Affiliates) are express third party beneficiaries of the provisions in this
Agreement reflecting the foregoing agreements. The parties hereto agree
that this _Section 12R_ shall not be amended or modified without prior
written consent by the Lead Arranger.
