\- iv -  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of August 27, 2012 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and among MandT Bank Corporation, a New York business corporation (" _M
andT_"), Hudson City Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Hudson_ ") and
Wilmington Trust Corporation, a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly owned
Subsidiary of MandT (" _Merger Sub_ ").

RECITALS 

A. The Boards of Directors of Hudson, MandT and Merger Sub
have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
companies and their shareholders to consummate the strategic business
combination transaction provided for in this Agreement, in which Hudson will,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge
with and into Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ "), with Merger Sub as the surviving
entity in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "
_Surviving Company_ "). 

B. The parties intend the Merger to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), and intend for this Agreement to constitute a
"plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. 

C. The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "
_DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time Hudson shall merge with and into Merger Sub.
Merger Sub shall be the Surviving Company in the Merger and shall continue its
existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. As of the Effective Time,
the separate corporate existence of Hudson shall cease.

Section 1.2 _Closing_. On the terms and subject to conditions set forth
in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, at the offices of Sullivan and
Cromwell LLP, counsel to Hudson, on a date to be specified by the parties,
which date shall be no later than three Business Days after the satisfaction
or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of
the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), unless another date, time or
place is agreed to in writing by MandT and Hudson. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, on or before the Closing Date, MandT shall cause to be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware
Secretary_ "), a Certificate of Merger (the " _Delaware Certificate of
Merger_ ") as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective as of the date and time specified in the Delaware Certificate of
Merger (such date and time, the " _Effective Time_ "). 

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Hudson shall vest in Surviving Company, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of Hudson shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Company. The Surviving Company shall assume the
liquidation account of Hudson at the Effective Time in accordance with 12
C.F.R. § 239.62, and thereafter shall administer the liquidation account in
accordance therewith.

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Company_. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Company shall be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until duly amended in
accordance with the respective terms thereof and applicable law.

Section 1.6 _Directors; Regional Matters_.

 

(a) MandT shall take all appropriate action so that, as of the Effective
Time and subject to and in accordance with the MandT Bylaws, the number of
directors constituting the Board of Directors of MandT (the " _M andT Board_")
shall be increased by one and Hudsons CEO shall be appointed as a director
of MandT with a term expiring at the first annual meeting of MandT shareholders
following the Effective Time.

 

(b) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Company and shall hold office until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed, or their earlier

serve until the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date as paid members of
a regional advisory board in accordance with the terms set forth in Section
1.6(c) of the Hudson Disclosure Schedule, the function of which will be to

former market area and to maintain and develop customer relationships.

 

Section 1.7 _Officers_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the officers
of the Surviving Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
officers of the

 



\- 2 -   Surviving Company and shall hold office until their respective successors

Section 1.8 _Bank Merger_. Immediately following the Merger, Hudson City
Savings Bank, a federal savings association and wholly owned Subsidiary of
Hudson (" _Hudson Bank_ "), will merge (the " _Bank Merger_ ") with and into
Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, a bank chartered under the laws of
the State of New York and a wholly owned Subsidiary of MandT (" _M andT Bank_").
MandT Bank shall be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and shall continue
its corporate existence under the name Manufacturers and Traders Trust
Company, and, following the Bank Merger, the separate existence of Hudson
Bank shall cease. The parties agree that the Bank Merger shall become
effective immediately following the Effective Time. The Bank Merger shall be
implemented pursuant to a subsidiary plan of merger, in a form to be
specified by MandT in consultation with Hudson (the " _Subsidiary Plan of
Merger_ "). In order to obtain the necessary state and federal Regulatory

accomplished prior to the filing of applications for Regulatory Approval:
(i)(A) Hudson shall cause Hudson Bank to approve the Subsidiary Plan of
Merger, (B) Hudson, as the sole shareholder of Hudson Bank, shall approve the

Merger and (C) MandT shall cause the Subsidiary Plan of Merger to be duly
executed by MandT Bank and delivered to Hudson. Prior to the Effective Time,
Hudson shall cause Hudson Bank, and MandT shall cause MandT Bank, to execute such
certificates of merger and articles of combination and such other documents
and certificates as are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective (" _Bank
Merger Certificates_ ") immediately following the Effective Time. MandT shall
take all appropriate action so that, as of the Effective Time and subject to
and in accordance with the organizational documents of MandT Bank, the number
of directors constituting the Board of Directors of MandT Bank shall be
increased by one and Hudsons CEO shall be appointed as a director of MandT
Bank.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; 

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of MandT, Hudson or the holder of
any of the following securities:

(a) All shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Hudson
(the " _Hudson Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that are owned, directly or indirectly, by Hudson or MandT
(other than (i) shares of Hudson Common Stock held in trust accounts, managed
accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary

 



\- 3 -   or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties, which
shall include any shares of Hudson Common Stock held in a rabbi or other
trusts for purposes of funding a Hudson Benefit Plan (any such shares, "
_Trust Account Common Shares_ "), (ii) shares of Hudson Common Stock held,
directly or indirectly, by Hudson or MandT in respect of a debt previously
contracted (any such shares, " _DPC Common Shares_ ") and (iii) the ESOP
Initial Financed Shares (as defined below)) (collectively, excluding clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii), the " _Exception Shares_ ", it being understood and
agreed that the Exception Shares shall include (A) the ESOP Subsequent
Financed Shares (as defined below) and (B) the number of Pledged ESOP Initial
Financed Shares (as defined below) having a value equal to the ESOPs
indebtedness collateralized thereby), shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no stock of MandT or cash (including cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Hudson Common Stock) shall be delivered in exchange therefor, except
that the cancellation of the ESOP Subsequent Financed Shares and the
applicable Pledged ESOP Initial Financed Shares shall be in consideration for
the repayment and/or forgiveness in full of the ESOPs indebtedness
collateralized thereby. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _ESOP
Initial Financed Shares_" shall be shares of Hudson Common Stock owned by the
Hudson Savings Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the " _ESOP_ ") that either
(A) have been allocated to participants in the ESOP or committed as of
the Effective Time for release and allocation to participants in the ESOP or
(B) were acquired prior to January 1, 2001 and pledged (and not committed for
release as of the Effective Time) as collateral for the debt incurred at the
time of acquisition of such shares (the " _Pledged ESOP Initial Financed
Shares_ "), and the " _ESOP Subsequent Financed Shares_ " shall be those
shares of Hudson Common Stock owned by the ESOP that were acquired
after January 1, 2001 and pledged (and not committed for release as of the
Effective Time) as collateral for the debt incurred at the time of acquisition
of such shares.

(b) Subject to Section 2.1(d), each share of Hudson Common Stock
(whether or not subject to restriction), including Trust Account Common
Shares, DPC Common Shares and ESOP Initial Financed Shares, but excluding all
Exception Shares and Dissenting Shares, outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this Article II, into the right to receive, at the election of the holder
thereof as provided in and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.3 and
2.4(f), either (i) a number of shares of common stock, par value $0.50 per
share, of MandT (the " _M andT Common Stock_") equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "
_Per Share Stock Consideration_ ") or (ii) an amount in cash equal to the
product of the Per Share Stock Consideration and the Closing Price (the " _Per
Share Cash Consideration_ ") ((i) and (ii) together, in the aggregate for all
such shares of Hudson Common Stock, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The
calculations required by this Section 2.1(b) shall be prepared jointly by MandT
and Hudson prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "
_Exchange Ratio_ " means 0.08403, as may be adjusted pursuant to Section
2.1(d), and (ii) " _Closing Price_ " means the average, rounded to the
nearest one ten-thousandth of the closing sale prices of MandT Common Stock on
the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") as reported by _The Wall Street
Journal_ for the ten trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 



\- 4 -  (c) All of the shares of Hudson Common Stock converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II are
hereinafter defined as " _Old Shares_." Old Shares shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form (each, an "
_Old Certificate_ "), in each case formerly representing Old Shares, shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except
the right to receive, as applicable, without interest, upon exchange of such
Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II (i) any dividends with
respect to Hudson Common Stock with a record date prior to the Effective Time
but unpaid as of the Effective Time and (ii) the consideration to which he or
she may be entitled pursuant to this Article II.

 

(d) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, MandT
Common Stock or Hudson Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased,
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment
shall be made to the Exchange Ratio to provide the holders of Hudson Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event; _provided_ , that nothing in this Section 2.1(d) shall be
construed to permit Hudson or MandT to take any action with respect to their
respective securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.2 _Appraisal Rights_. Each issued and outstanding share of
Hudson Common Stock the holder of which has perfected his right to dissent
under the DGCL and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the
Effective Time (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or
represent a right to receive the per share Merger Consideration hereunder,
and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by
the DGCL. Hudson shall give MandT prompt notice upon receipt by Hudson of any
such demands for payment of the fair value of such shares of Hudson Common
Stock, any withdrawals of such notice and any other instruments provided
pursuant to applicable law (any shareholder duly making such demand being
hereinafter called a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ "). Hudson shall not, except
with the prior written consent of MandT, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment, or
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or
the taking of any other action by such Dissenting Shareholder as may be
necessary to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL. Hudson shall give MandT
the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any such demands. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting
Shares shall be made by the Surviving Company. If any Dissenting Shareholder
shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
his, her or its right to such payment at or prior to the Effective Time, such
holders shares of Hudson Common Stock shall be converted into a right to
receive cash or MandT Common Stock in accordance with the applicable provisions
of this Agreement. If such holder shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment after the Effective
Time (or the Election Deadline), each share of Hudson Common Stock of such
holder shall be treated as a No Election Share. 

 



\- 5 -  Section 2.3 _Election Procedures_.

 

(a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials in such form as MandT and Hudson shall mutually agree (the "
_Election Form_ ") shall be mailed 35 days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date or on such other date as MandT and Hudson shall mutually agree (the "
_Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of Hudson Common Stock as of the
close of business on the fifth Business Day prior to the Mailing Date (the "
_Election Form Record Date_ ").

 

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to specify
(A) the number of shares of such holders Hudson Common Stock with respect to
which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration ("
_Stock Election Shares_ "), (B) the number of shares of such holders Hudson
Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration (" _Cash Election Shares_ ") or (C) that such holder makes
no election with respect to such holders Hudson Common Stock (" _No Election
Shares_ "). Any Hudson Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent
has not received an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 30th day following the Mailing Date (or
such other time and date as MandT and Hudson may mutually agree) (the "
_Election Deadline_ ") shall also be deemed to be No Election
Shares. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any
election that may be made with respect to any share to be cancelled pursuant
to Section 2.1(a) with respect of the ESOP indebtedness shall be disregarded
for purposes of Section 2.3(f).

(c) MandT shall make available one or more Election Forms as may
reasonably be requested from time to time by any person who becomes a holder
(or beneficial owner) of Hudson Common Stock between the Election Form Record
Date and the close of business on the Business Day prior to the
Election Deadline, and Hudson shall provide to the Exchange Agent all
information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

(d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the
Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form
by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed
only if accompanied by one or more Old Certificates (or customary affidavits
and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such certificates or
the guaranteed delivery of such certificates) representing all shares of
Hudson Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed
transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be
revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form only by
written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline.
In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline,
unless a subsequent properly completed Election Form is submitted
and actually received by the Exchange Agent by the Election Deadline, the
shares of Hudson Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become
No Election Shares and MandT shall cause the Old Certificates to be promptly
returned without charge to the person submitting the Election Form upon
written request to that effect from the holder who submitted the Election
Form.

 



\- 6 -   Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the
Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any
election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to
disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith
decisions of MandT regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive.
Neither MandT nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify
any person of any defect in an Election Form.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement,
the total number of shares of Hudson Common Stock that will be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1
(which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to include the Dissenting Shares)
shall equal the sum of (i) 204,338,066 shares of Hudson Common Stock and (ii)
the product of (A) 40% and (B) the number of shares of Hudson Common Stock
that are issued, from and after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time, pursuant to the exercise of Hudson Stock Options and Hudson Other Stock
Awards outstanding as of the date hereof (such number of shares of Hudson
Common Stock, the " _Target Cash Conversion Amount_ ").

(f) Within 10 Business Days after the Effective Time, MandT shall cause
the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the holders of Hudson Common
Stock of rights to receive MandT Common Stock or cash in the Merger in
accordance with the Election Forms as follows:

 

(i) _Cash Oversubscribed_. If the total number of the Cash
Election Shares (which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to include the
Dissenting Shares) is greater than the Target Cash Conversion Amount, then:



     | A. | all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, 
---|---|--- 
 



     | B. | the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash
Election Shares, by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of
shares to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration (" _Stock Designated
Shares_ ") such that the aggregate number of shares of Hudson Common Stock
that will be paid the Per Share Cash Consideration equals the Target Cash
Conversion Amount, and all Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, and 
---|---|--- 



     | C. | the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares
will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration. 
---|---|--- 
 

(ii) _Cash Undersubscribed_. If the total number of the Cash
Election Shares (which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to include the
Dissenting Shares) is less than the Target Cash Conversion Amount, then:



 



\- 7 -  right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, 
---|---|--- 
 



     | B. | the Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the No
Election Shares, by a random selection process, and then (if necessary) from
among the Stock Election Shares, by a pro rata selection process, a
sufficient number of shares to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration ("
_Cash Designated Shares_ ") such that the aggregate number of shares of Hudson
Common Stock that will be paid the Per Share Cash Consideration equals the
Target Cash Conversion Amount, and all Cash Designated Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | C. | the Stock Election Shares and the No Election Shares that are
not Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Stock Consideration.  
---|---|--- 

(iii) _Cash Subscriptions Sufficient_. If the number of Cash
Election Shares (which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to include the
Dissenting Shares) is equal to the Target Cash Conversion Amount, then
subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall not apply and all Cash Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration and all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration.

 

The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall consist
of such equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually determined by MandT
and Hudson.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, a sufficient number of Cash Election Shares may be converted into
the right to receive Per Share Stock Consideration to the extent necessary to
secure the tax opinions required by Sections 7.2(d) and 7.3(d).

 

Section 2.4 _Exchange Procedures_.

(a) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no
event later than 10 days thereafter, and continuing until the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, MandT shall make available on a timely basis
or cause to be made available to an exchange agent agreed upon by MandT and
Hudson (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") (i) cash in an amount sufficient to allow
the Exchange Agent to make all payments that may be required pursuant to this
Article II and (ii) certificates, or at MandTs option, evidence of shares in
book entry form, representing the shares of MandT Common Stock ("
_New Certificates_ "), each to be given to the holders of Hudson Common Stock
in exchange for Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II. Upon such
anniversary, any such cash or New Certificates remaining in the possession of
the Exchange Agent (together with any earnings in respect thereof) shall be
delivered to MandT. Any holder of

 



\- 8 -   Old Certificates who has not theretofore exchanged his or her Old
Certificates pursuant to this Article II shall thereafter be entitled to look
exclusively to MandT, and only as a general creditor thereof, for the
consideration to which he or she may be entitled upon exchange of such Old
Certificates pursuant to this Article II. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any holder
of Old Certificates for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than ten
days thereafter, MandT shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to
each person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of
record of Hudson Common Stock and who theretofore has not submitted such
holders Old Certificates with an Election Form, a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
such certificates to the Exchange Agent) containing instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Old Certificates in exchange for the consideration
to which such person may be entitled pursuant to this Article II. After
completion of the allocation procedure set forth in Section 2.3 and upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of an Old Certificate for cancellation
together with such letter of transmittal or Election Form, as the case may be,
duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the
holder of such Old Certificate shall promptly be provided in exchange
therefor, but in no event later than ten Business Days after due surrender, a
New Certificate and/or a check in the amount to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Article II, and the Old Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest will accrue or be paid with respect to any
property to be delivered upon surrender of Old Certificates.

 

(c) If any cash payment is to be made in a name other than that in
which the Old Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it
shall be a condition of such exchange that the person requesting such exchange
shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the making of such
payment of the Per Share Cash Consideration in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the Old Certificate surrendered, or required for any
other reason relating to such holder or requesting person, or shall establish
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been
paid or is not payable. If any New Certificate representing shares of MandT
Common Stock is to be issued in the name of other than the registered holder
of the Old Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
representing shares of MandT Common Stock in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the Old Certificate surrendered, or required for any
other reason relating to such holder or requesting person, or shall establish
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 



\- 9 -  (d) No dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time with respect to MandT Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender
such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender
of an Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares of MandT Common Stock represented by the New
Certificate.

(e) At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of Old Shares.

 

(f) If any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Old
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by MandT or the
Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount
as MandT or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, MandT or the
Exchange Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old
Certificate, pay or cause to be paid the consideration deliverable in respect
of the Old Shares formerly represented by such Old Certificate pursuant to
this Article II.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither
certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of MandT Common Stock shall be
issued in the Merger. Each holder who otherwise would have been entitled to a
fraction of a share of MandT Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash
(without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share
interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into
account all shares of Hudson Common Stock owned by such holder at the
Effective Time) by the Closing Price. No such holder shall be entitled to
dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional
share.

Section 2.5 _Stock Options_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, all outstanding and unexercised employee
and director options to purchase shares of Hudson Common Stock (each, a "
_Hudson Stock Option_ "), whether vested or unvested at the Effective Time,
shall then cease to represent an option to purchase Hudson Common Stock and
will be converted automatically into options to purchase MandT Common Stock;
_provided_ , that with respect to each Hudson Stock Option that is subject to
performance-based vesting conditions, the performance-based vesting conditions
applicable to such Hudson Stock Option shall be deemed satisfied at the
Effective Time. The following shall apply with respect to each Hudson Stock
Option after the Effective Time:

(i) the number of shares of MandT Common Stock purchasable upon exercise
of each Hudson Stock Option will equal the product of (x) the number
of shares of Hudson Common Stock that were purchasable under the Hudson Stock
Option immediately before the

 



\- 10 -   Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to
the nearest whole share; and

(ii) the exercise price per share of MandT Common Stock for each Hudson
Stock Option will equal (x) the per share exercise price of the Hudson
Stock Option in effect immediately before the Effective Time divided by (y)
the Exchange Ratio, rounded up, if necessary, to the nearest cent.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the exercise price and the
number of shares of MandT Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Hudson
Stock Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with any applicable
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and (ii) in the case of any Hudson
Stock Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and
the number of shares of MandT Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option
shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such
adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section
424(a) of the Code. 

(c) MandT will assume each Hudson Stock Option as adjusted in
accordance with Section 2.5(a) above. Except as specifically provided above,
following the Effective Time, each Hudson Stock Option shall continue to be
governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as were
applicable under such Hudson Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to the applicable award agreement. As used in this Agreement,
the term " _Hudson Stock Plans_ " means the plans set forth in Section 2.5(c)
of the Hudson Disclosure Schedule.

Section 2.6 _Hudson Deferred Stock Units_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each deferred stock unit of Hudson which
becomes vested solely based on the continued service of the holder thereof,
granted under any of the Hudson Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Hudson DSU_ ") shall cease to
represent a right or award with respect to shares of Hudson Common Stock and
shall be automatically converted, at the Effective Time, into an award with
respect to MandT Common Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , the following shall
apply at the Effective Time: the number of shares of MandT Common Stock subject
to the Hudson DSU shall be equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Hudson Common Stock subject to the Hudson DSU immediately before the Effective
Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. 

(b) MandT will assume each Hudson DSU as adjusted in accordance
with Section 2.6(a) above. Except as specifically provided above, following
the Effective Time, each Hudson DSU shall continue to be governed by the same
terms and conditions (including vesting) as were applicable under such Hudson
DSU immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the applicable award
agreement.

 



\- 11 -  Section 2.7 _Hudson Performance Deferred Stock Units_. 

(a) Each deferred stock unit award of Hudson which becomes vested in
part based on the achievement of performance conditions granted under the
Hudson Stock Plans, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the " _Hudson Performance DSU_ "), shall cease to represent a right or
award with respect to shares of Hudson Common Stock and shall (i) with
respect to each Hudson Performance DSU granted prior to the date hereof the
performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such Hudson Performance DSU
shall be deemed satisfied at the Effective Time (it being understood that
with respect to each such Hudson Performance DSU that is subject to multiple
levels of pay-out depending on the level of performance achieved, performance
shall be deemed achieved at target level for the applicable performance
measurement period and the number of shares earned with respect to such Hudson
Performance DSU shall be fixed at target level as of the Effective Time), and,
as of the Effective Time: (A) a portion of each then outstanding Hudson
Performance DSU award granted prior to the date hereof shall vest in an amount
determined by multiplying (x) the number of Hudson Performance DSUs underlying
the applicable Hudson Performance DSU award (taking into account the deemed
performance described above) by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days that have elapsed during the performance measurement period
through the Effective Time and the denominator of which is the total number
of days in the performance measurement period; and (B) each Hudson
Performance DSU that vests in accordance with Section 2.7(a)(i)(A) above
shall, subject to MandTs receipt of an award surrender agreement from the
holder thereof acknowledging the treatment of the Hudson equity awards in
accordance with this Agreement, be automatically converted into the right to
receive a payment in cash as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than ten Business Days thereafter)
equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration less applicable taxes and
withholding; and (ii) each Hudson Performance DSU that does not vest pursuant
to Section 2.7(a)(i)(A) above including each Hudson Performance DSU granted
after the date hereof shall be automatically converted into a right to receive
that number of shares of MandT Common Stock as is equal to the Exchange Ratio.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.7 to the contrary, the payment in
respect of the vested portion of the Hudson Performance DSUs at the Effective
Time as provided in Section 2.7(a)(i)(B) shall be delayed to a later date or
event as shall comply with Section 409A of the Code as determined to
be necessary by Hudson based on written advice of counsel to Hudson, provided
that any such later date or event shall be communicated in writing to MandT as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof and in any event prior to
the Effective Time.

(b) MandT will assume each Hudson Performance DSU that is
converted pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(ii) above. Except as specifically
provided above, following the Effective Time, each Hudson Performance DSU
shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including
vesting) as were applicable under such Hudson Performance DSU immediately
prior to the Effective pursuant to the applicable award agreement.

 



\- 12 -  Section 2.8 _Hudson Other Stock Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or
accrued, to receive shares of Hudson Common Stock or cash payments measured
by the value of a number of shares of Hudson Common Stock including, a
deferred share of Hudson Common Stock, granted under any of the Hudson Stock
Plans, the Hudson Officers Deferred Compensation Plan, the Hudson Directors
Deferred Compensation Plan or otherwise that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Hudson Stock Options, Hudson DSUs and Hudson
Performance DSUs) (each, a " _Hudson Other Stock Award_ ") shall be deemed to
be converted into the right to acquire or receive benefits measured by the
value of (as the case may be) the number of shares of MandT Common Stock equal
to the product of (i) the number of shares of Hudson Common Stock subject to
the Hudson Other Stock Award immediately before the Effective Time and (ii)
the Exchange Ratio.

(b) MandT will assume each Hudson Other Stock Award as adjusted in
accordance with Section 2.8(a) above. Except as specifically provided
above, following the Effective Time, each Hudson Other Stock Award shall
continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Hudson Other Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 2.9 _Required Hudson Action; Effect on M andT Common Stock; Required
MandT Action_.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Hudson
and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Hudson, as
applicable, shall adopt resolutions and take any other necessary action to
effectuate the provisions of Sections 2.5 through 2.8. Each share of MandT
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain
outstanding. Before the Effective Time, MandT will take all corporate action

any obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that provides for any
post-employment or post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits for
retired, former or current employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof,
except as required by Section 4980B of the Code. To the extent that Hudson and

corporation" or "controlled corporation" in any distribution occurring during
the last 30 months that was purported or intended to be governed by Section
355 of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law).

 

Section 4.14 _Reorganization_. MandT has not taken or agreed to take any
action, and is not aware of any fact or circumstance, that would prevent or
impede, or could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede, the Merger from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

 

Section 4.15 _Accounting and Internal Controls_.

 

(a) The records, systems, controls, data and information of MandT and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of MandT or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom). MandT and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. MandT has designed
and implemented disclosure controls and procedures (within the meaning of
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to MandT and its Subsidiaries is made known to
its management by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

(b) MandTs management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness
of its internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended
December 31, 2011, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. MandT has Previously Disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date hereof, to its auditors and the audit committee of its board
of directors: (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting and (B) any
fraud that involves management or other employees who have a significant role
in its internal controls over financial reporting.

(c) Since January 1, 2010, (A) neither MandT nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to MandTs knowledge, any director, officer, auditor,
accountant or representative of it or any of its

 



\- 43 -   Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or written claim regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods
(including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of MandT or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or written claim that MandT or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (B) no attorney
representing MandT or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by it or
any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of
securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by it or any of
its officers or directors to its board of directors or any committee thereof
or to any of its directors or officers.

Section 4.16 _Derivatives_. Except as would not reasonably be
likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect
on MandT, all Derivative Contracts, whether entered into for its own account, or
for the account of one or more of its Subsidiaries or their respective
customers, were entered into (i) in accordance with prudent business
practices and all applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory policies
and (ii) with counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the
time; and each Derivative Contract constitutes the valid and legally binding
obligation of it or one of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, enforceable
in accordance with its terms (subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exceptions), and is in full force and effect. Except as would not reasonably
be likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect
on MandT, neither MandT nor its Subsidiaries, nor to MandTs knowledge any other
party thereto, is in breach of any of its obligations under any Derivative
Contract.

Section 4.17 _Financing_. MandT has, or will have available to it prior
to the Closing Date, all funds necessary to satisfy all of its obligations
hereunder.

Section 4.18 _No Additional Representations_.

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made by MandT and
Merger Sub in this Article IV, none of MandT, Merger Sub or any other person
makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to MandT,
its Subsidiaries, Merger Sub or their respective businesses, operations,
assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or otherwise) or prospects, and MandT
and Merger Sub hereby disclaim any such other representations or warranties.
In particular, without limiting the foregoing disclaimer, none of MandT, Merger
Sub or any other person makes or has made any representation or warranty to
Hudson or any of its affiliates or representatives with respect to (i) any
financial projection, forecast, estimate, budget or prospect information
relating to MandT, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or
(ii) except for the representations and warranties made by MandT and Merger Sub
in this Article IV, any oral or written information presented to Hudson or
any of its affiliates or representatives in the course of their due diligence
investigation of MandT, the negotiation of this Agreement or in the course of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



\- 44 -  (b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, MandT and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that neither Hudson nor any
other person has made or is making any representations or warranties relating
to Hudson whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given by
Hudson in Article III hereof, including any implied representation or warranty
as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding Hudson
furnished or made available to MandT or any of its representatives. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, MandT and Merger Sub acknowledge
that, no representations or warranties are made with respect to any
projections, forecasts, estimates, budgets or prospect information that may
have been made available to MandT or any of its representatives.

(a) MandT and Hudson shall promptly (and in any event within 45 days
after the date hereof) prepare and file with the SEC the Registration
Statement, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a

have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after such filing, and each of MandT and Hudson shall
thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to its shareholders. MandT
shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state
securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Hudson shall furnish all
information concerning Hudson and the holders of Hudson Common Stock as may
be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

 

(b) The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties
or Governmental Entities; _provided_ , _however_ , that MandT and MandT Bank, as
applicable, shall file applications (i) with the Federal Reserve under the BHC
Act and the Bank Merger Act, and (ii) with the New York State Department of
Financial Services under applicable laws, in each case no later than twenty
(20) Business Days following the date of this Agreement. Hudson and MandT shall
have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each
will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws, all the
information relating to Hudson or MandT, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly
as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third

(c) Each of MandT and Hudson shall, upon request, promptly furnish to

filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of MandT, Hudson or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with or
in contemplation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of MandT and Hudson agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries,
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement will, at the time
the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any,
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Joint
Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to shareholders and at the time of Hudsons meeting of its
shareholders to consider and vote upon approval of this Agreement, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not
misleading. Each of MandT and Hudson further agrees that if it becomes aware
that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the
Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement to be false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly
inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the

and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of businesses or assets of MandT, Hudson and
their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained
in this Agreement shall require MandT to take any actions specified in this
Section 6.1(d) that would reasonably be likely to have a material and adverse
effect on MandT and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, giving effect to the
Merger (measured on a scale relative to Hudson and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole) (a " _Burdensome Condition_ ").

 

(e) MandT agrees to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving Company, at or prior to the
Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees, and other
instruments required for the due assumption of Hudsons outstanding debt,
guarantees, securities, and other agreements to the extent required by the
terms of such debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements.

 

(f) Each of MandT and Hudson shall promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or
approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to

 



\- 51 -   believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory
Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be
materially delayed.

 

Section 6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, Hudson
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives of
MandT, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior
to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records,
and, during such period, Hudson shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
make available to MandT (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state
banking laws (other than reports or documents that Hudson is not permitted to
disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as MandT may reasonably request. Upon the
reasonable request of Hudson, MandT shall furnish such reasonable information
about it and its business as is relevant to Hudson and its shareholders in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither
Hudson nor MandT, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall be required
to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or its
Subsidiaries or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

 

(b) All nonpublic information and materials provided pursuant to this
Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
entered into between the parties as of June 29, 2012 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation by a party hereto or its representatives shall
affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representations, warranties or
covenants of the other party set forth in this Agreement.

Section 6.3 _Shareholder Approvals_.

 

(a) The Board of Directors of Hudson has resolved to recommend to
Hudsons shareholders that they approve this Agreement, and will submit to
its shareholders this Agreement and any other matters required to be approved
by its shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement. In
furtherance of that obligation, Hudson will take, in accordance with
applicable law and the Hudson Articles and Hudson Bylaws, all action necessary
to convene a meeting of its shareholders, as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act by the
SEC, for the purpose of obtaining the Hudson Shareholder Approval (the "
_Hudson Shareholder Meeting_ "). The Board of Directors of Hudson will use all
reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders the

 



\- 52 -   Hudson Shareholder Approval, including by communicating to its shareholders
its recommendation that they adopt and approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. However, if the Board of Directors of
Hudson, after consultation with (and based on the advice of) outside counsel,
determines in good faith that, because of the receipt by Hudson of an
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Hudson concludes in
good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, it would more likely than not
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue
to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to Hudsons
shareholders, the Board of Directors of Hudson may submit this Agreement to
its shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving
this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in
which event the Board of Directors of Hudson may communicate the basis for
its lack of a recommendation to the shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement
or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by
law; _provided_ that Hudson may not take any actions under this sentence
until after giving MandT at least three Business Days to respond to any such
Acquisition Proposal or other circumstances giving rise to such particular
proposed action (and after giving MandT notice of the latest material terms and
conditions and the identity of the third party in any such Acquisition
Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable
detail such other circumstances) and then taking into account any amendment
or modification to this Agreement proposed by MandT. In determining whether to
change its recommendation, the Board of Directors of Hudson shall take into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by MandT and any
other information provided by MandT in response to such notice. Any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3(a), including with respect to the
notice periods referred to in this Section 6.3(a). Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Hudson of its obligation to submit this
Agreement to its shareholders to a vote.

 

(b) The Board of Directors of MandT has resolved to recommend to
MandTs shareholders that they approve the issuance of MandT Common Stock in
connection with the Merger, and will submit to its shareholders the proposed
issuance of MandT Common Stock and any other matters required to be approved by
its shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement. MandT
shall duly take, in accordance with applicable law and the governing
organization documents of MandT, all action necessary to call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act by the SEC, for the purpose of obtaining the MandT Shareholder
Approval (the " _M andT Shareholder Meeting_"). The Board of Directors of MandT
will use all reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders the MandT
Shareholder Approval, including by communicating to its shareholders its
recommendation that they approve the issuance of MandT Common Stock in
connection with the Merger. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to relieve MandT of its obligation to submit this Agreement to its

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the 18-month anniversary of the Effective Time, MandT shall provide employee
benefit and compensation plans for the benefit of employees who are actively
employed by Hudson and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (" _Covered
Employees_ ") while employed by MandT or any of its Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time that provide employee benefits and compensation opportunities
which are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits and
compensation opportunities that are provided by Hudson and its Subsidiaries
to Covered Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the
value of the benefits provided under the ESOP prior to the Closing Date which
shall not be considered in determining whether benefits are no less favorable
in the aggregate during the period noted above; it being understood that
eligibility to participate in a tax-qualified savings plan with an employer
matching contribution shall be available to the Covered Employees pursuant to
the terms of the applicable plan of MandT

 



\- 54 -   as in effect from time to time). Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, MandT shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to
maintain the Severance Pay Plan of Hudson City Savings Bank without amendment
(except as required by applicable law, including tax law) following the
Effective Time (the " _Hudson Severance Plan_ ") and provide each Covered
Employee whose employment is terminated (other than a Covered Employee who is
terminated under circumstances that constitute a termination for "cause" or
under other circumstances not entitling them to severance under the Hudson
Severance Plan or who is otherwise party to an individual agreement that
provides for severance pay) during the one-year period following the Effective
Time with the severance payments and benefits to which the Covered Employee
would have been entitled under the Hudson Severance Plan immediately prior
to the Effective Time, subject to the terms of the Hudson Severance Plan,
including the requirement to sign a waiver and release. In addition, MandT
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, (i) provide eligible former
employees of Hudson and its Subsidiaries who retired prior to the Effective
Time and who participate as of the Effective Time in the retiree medical and
life insurance plans maintained by Hudson and identified in Section 3.11(g) of
the Hudson Disclosure Schedule (the " _Hudson Retiree Welfare Plans_ ") with
the ability to continue to participate in the Hudson Retiree Welfare Plans in
accordance with the terms of such plans as in effect from time to time during
the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the fifth
anniversary of the Effective Time, (ii) provide each Covered Employee who
retires on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs and who is eligible to participate in the Hudson Retiree Welfare
Plans on the date of his or her retirement from MandT with the ability to
participate in the Hudson Retiree Welfare Plans in accordance with the terms
of such plans as in effect from time to time from his or her applicable
retirement date until the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time, (iii) deem
Covered Employees who as of immediately prior to the Effective Time satisfy
the eligibility requirements of the Hudson Retiree Welfare Plans (but who
do not retire on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs) (the " _Eligible Hudson Covered Employees_ ") to have
satisfied the eligibility requirements of the MandT Bank Retiree Medical Plan
and the MandT Bank Retiree Life Insurance Plan, in each case, as in effect from
time to time, and (iv) recognize service credit with Hudson or any of its
Subsidiaries for Covered Employees who are not Eligible Hudson Covered
Employees and who are not eligible to participate in the Hudson Retiree
Welfare Plans in accordance with either of clauses (i) or (ii) of this
sentence, for purposes of meeting the eligibility requirements of the MandT Bank
Retiree Medical Plan and the MandT Bank Retiree Life Insurance Plan, in each
case, as in effect from time to time, to the same extent such service credit
was recognized for such purposes by Hudson immediately prior to the Effective
Time. After the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time, MandT shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Company to provide the retirees of Hudson and its
Subsidiaries identified in clause (i) and the retired Covered Employees
identified in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence with access
to enroll in the MandT Bank Retiree Medical Plan and the MandT Bank Retiree Life
Insurance Plan as in effect on the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time (if
any) in accordance with the terms of such plans as in effect from time to
time, _provided_ that such retirees shall be deemed to satisfy the eligibility
requirements of such plans and shall receive credit for their service with
Hudson and its Subsidiaries (to the same extent such service was
recognized by Hudson prior to such retirees

 



\- 55 -   retirement from Hudson) for purposes of any employer subsidy as in effect on
the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time under the terms of the MandT plans
(if any) in accordance with the terms of such plans as in effect from time to
time.

(b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to
participate in a MandT Benefit Plan, MandT shall cause such employee benefit plan
to (i) recognize the service of such Covered Employee with Hudson or its
Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) for purposes of eligibility,
vesting, level of benefits and benefit accrual (other than for purposes of
benefit accruals or levels of credit under any MandT Benefit Plan that is a
defined benefit pension plan), under such MandT Benefit Plan, to the same
extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time
under a comparable Hudson Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
that such service credit shall not be recognized (A) for purposes of any plan
or arrangement under which similarly-situated employees of MandT and its
Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or that is grandfathered
or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation, or (B)
if such recognition of service would operate to duplicate any benefits of a
Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service; and (ii) with
respect to any MandT Benefit Plan that provides medical, dental or vision
benefits in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate, for the
plan year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate, (A)
cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods
under such MandT Benefit Plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee
and his or her covered dependents to the extent such limitation would have
been waived or satisfied under the Hudson Benefit Plan in which such Covered
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B)
recognize any health expenses incurred by such Covered Employee and his or her
covered dependents in the year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later,
the year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate) for
purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense
requirements and any lifetime maximums under any such MandT Benefit Plan.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, subject to the requirements of
applicable law, MandT shall honor all obligations to current and former
employees of Hudson and its Subsidiaries under the Hudson Benefit Plans,
including all employment, change of control or severance agreements entered
into by Hudson or its Subsidiaries or adopted by the Board of Directors of
Hudson, in each case consistent with the terms of the applicable Hudson
Benefit Plan; _provided_ , that with respect to each employment agreement and
change of control agreement entered into by Hudson or its Subsidiaries and
identified on Section 3.11(a) of the Hudson Disclosure Schedule (each, an "
_Executive Agreement_ "), (1) the bonus component of any severance calculation
performed pursuant to each such Executive Agreement for Executive Vice
Presidents and above shall be no less than the bonus component that would have
resulted in respect of a termination of employment on the date hereof as
identified on Section 6.5(c) of the Hudson Disclosure Schedule, and (2) the
provisions in the Executive Agreements that allow Hudson to elect to cancel a
terminating employees outstanding stock options and shares of restricted
stock in exchange for a cash payment equal to the spread value of the
stock options and the value of the restricted stock shall not be applicable.

 



\- 56 -  (d) Hudson and each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall,
effective no later than immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the
Closing, adopt such resolutions and/or amendments to the ESOP, the ESOP trust
or the ESOP Loan documents (if any) (and take any other required action)
to (i) effectuate the mechanics relating to the repayment and/or forgiveness
of the ESOP Loans contemplated by Section 2.1(a) of this Agreement and to
provide for the treatment of the Exception Shares held in the ESOP trust in
accordance with Article II of this Agreement and (ii) terminate the ESOP
(with distributions to occur upon receipt of a favorable determination letter
from the IRS in respect of such termination). No later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, Hudson shall provide MandT with (A) certified
copies of the resolutions and/or amendments adopted by the Board of Directors
(or the appropriate committee thereof) of Hudson or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, authorizing that the ESOP has been terminated, and (B) executed
amendments to the ESOP, the ESOP trust and the ESOP Loan documents, as
applicable, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to MandT to effectuate
such termination and any other amendments as set forth above.

(e) Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall be construed to limit the right
of MandT or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date,
Hudson and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Hudson Benefit Plan or
other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination
is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this
Section 6.5 be construed to require MandT or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
following the Closing Date, Hudson and its Subsidiaries) to retain the
employment of any particular employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries for
any fixed period of time following the Closing Date. This Agreement shall
inure exclusively to the benefit of, and be binding upon the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns, and no current or former
Employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for
any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer on any person other than
the parties hereto or their respective successors and assigns any rights,
remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, MandT shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law (and shall
also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law provided the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former director,
officer and employee of Hudson and its Subsidiaries or fiduciaries of Hudson
or any of its Subsidiaries under Hudson Plans (in each case, when acting in
such capacity) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



\- 57 -  (b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six years
following the Effective Time, MandT will provide or purchase directors and
officers liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former
officers and directors of Hudson or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as of
the Effective Time) (providing only for Side A coverage for Indemnified
Persons where the existing policies also include Side B coverage for Hudson)
with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts
or events occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), which insurance will contain at least the
same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Person as that coverage currently provided by
Hudson; _provided_ that in no event shall MandT be required to expend, on an
annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premiums
paid as of the date hereof by Hudson for any such insurance (the " _Premium
Cap_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that if any such annual expense at any time
would exceed the Premium Cap, then MandT will cause to be maintained policies of
insurance which provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. At the option of MandT, prior to the Effective Time
and in lieu of the foregoing, Hudson shall purchase a tail policy for
directors and officers liability insurance on the terms described in the
prior sentence (including subject to the Premium Cap) and fully pay for such
policy prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification under
Section 6.6(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, will promptly notify MandT; _provided_ that
failure to so notify will not affect the obligations of MandT under Section
6.6(a) unless and to the extent that MandT is actually and materially prejudiced
as a consequence.

(d) If MandT or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or
merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its
assets to any other entity, then and in each case, MandT will cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of MandT will assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

 

Section 6.7 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the
Effective Time, MandT and Hudson shall each take all such steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Hudson Common
Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of
Hudson Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

Section 6.8 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Hudson agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
its Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents, advisors, representatives,
investment bankers and affiliates (" _Representatives_ ") not to, initiate,
solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals
with respect to, or engage or participate in any negotiations concerning, or
provide

 



\- 58 -   any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any
discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_
that, in the event Hudson receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ Acquisition
Proposal and the Board of Directors of Hudson concludes in good faith that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a
Superior Proposal, Hudson may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic
information and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent
that the Board of Directors of Hudson concludes in good faith (and based on
the advice of outside counsel) that failure to take such actions would be more
likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; _provided_ that prior to providing any nonpublic
information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso or
engaging in any negotiations or substantive discussions, it shall have entered
into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less
favorable to Hudson than the Confidentiality Agreement. Hudson will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any persons
other than MandT with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will, subject to
applicable law, (x) enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating
to an Acquisition Proposal and (y) promptly request and confirm the return or
destruction of any confidential information provided to any person (other
than MandT and its Affiliates) pursuant to any such confidentiality or similar
agreement. Hudson will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) advise MandT
of any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
or any request for nonpublic information or inquiry that would reasonably be
expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal and the material terms thereof
(including the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal, and,
if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed contracts), and will keep MandT promptly apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and conditions
of any such request, inquiry or Acquisition Proposal or any material changes
or developments in the status or terms thereof) on a current basis. Hudson
agrees that it shall simultaneously provide to MandT any confidential or
nonpublic information concerning Hudson or any of its Subsidiaries that may
be provided to any other person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal
which has not previously been provided to MandT.

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Hudson or its
Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that such
Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant
to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 

As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means a tender or
exchange offer, proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business
combination involving Hudson or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any
proposal or offer to acquire in any manner more than 20% of the voting power
in, or more than 20% of the fair market value of the business, assets or
deposits of, Hudson or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any sale of whole loans and
securitizations in the ordinary course and any _bona fide_ internal
reorganization. 

 



\- 59 -  As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited 
_bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal (with the percentages set forth in
the definition of such term changed from 20% to 50%) that the Board of
Directors of Hudson concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a
financial point of view to its shareholders than the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (i) after receiving the advice of its
financial advisors (who shall be a nationally recognized investment banking
firm), (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such
transaction on the terms set forth therein, (iii) after taking into account
all legal (with the advice of outside counsel), financial (including the
financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal (including any expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
closing) and any other relevant factors permitted under applicable law and
(iv) after taking into account any revisions to the terms of this
Agreement contemplated by Section 6.3(a).

Section 6.9 _Takeover Laws_. No party will take any action that would
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be subject to
requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them will take all
necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the
continued exemption of) those transactions from, or if necessary challenge
the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or
hereafter in effect.

Section 6.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Hudson and MandT will give
prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it
that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse
Effect with respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a material breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the
aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII; _provided_ , that an
unintentional failure to give such notice shall not separately constitute a
failure of any condition in Article VII or a basis to terminate this Agreement
unless the underlying fact, event or circumstance would independently result
in such failure or provide such basis. 

Section 6.11 _Shareholder Litigation_. Hudson shall give MandT the
opportunity to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of
any shareholder litigation against Hudson and/or its directors or Affiliates
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without MandTs prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 6.12 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give MandT, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the operations of Hudson or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Hudson, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of MandT or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each
of Hudson and MandT shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its
Subsidiaries respective operations.

 



\- 60 -  Section 6.13 _Transition_. Commencing following the date hereof, and in
all cases subject to applicable law, Hudson shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, cooperate with MandT and its Subsidiaries to facilitate the
integration of the parties and their respective businesses and
operating systems effective as of the Closing Date or such later date as may
be determined by MandT. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from
the date hereof through the Closing Date and consistent with the performance
of their day-to-day operations and the continuous operation of Hudson and its
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, Hudson shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the employees, officers and
representatives of Hudson and its Subsidiaries to provide information, data
and support, including information, data and support from their outside
contractors and vendors, and to assist MandT in performing all tasks, including
equipment installation, reasonably required to result in a
successful integration at the Closing or such later date as may be determined
by MandT.

Section 6.14   _Portfolio Restructuring_. During the period commencing
on the later of (i) the date of receipt of all Requisite Regulatory Approvals
and (ii) the date on which each of the Hudson Shareholder Approval and
MandT Shareholder Approval is obtained and until the Closing, the parties shall
cooperate in good faith, subject to applicable law and the terms and
conditions of any Hudson Regulatory Agreements, to restructure Hudsons
investment securities portfolio, mortgage portfolio and debt capital
structure effective immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 6.14 shall permit Hudson to
undertake any action that would otherwise be prohibited pursuant to the terms
of Section 5.2. Hudsons representations, warranties and covenants contained
in this Agreement shall not be deemed to be untrue or breached in any respect
for any purpose as a consequence of any action which may be jointly
undertaken pursuant to this Section 6.14.

Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding approval thereof by the shareholders of Hudson or MandT:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of MandT and Hudson;

 

(b) by either MandT or Hudson:

 

(i) if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory
Approval has denied approval of the Merger and such denial has become final
and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall
have issued a final and nonappealable order, injunction or decree permanently
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(ii) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the
first anniversary of the date hereof (such date, the " _Outside Date_ "),
unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe
the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement;

(iii) if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or
agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this
Agreement on the part of Hudson, in the case of a termination by MandT, or on
the part of the MandT, in the case of a termination by Hudson, which breach,
either individually or in the aggregate with other breaches by such party,
would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure
of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be, and
which is not cured within the earlier of the Outside Date and 60 days
following written notice to the party committing such breach or by its nature
or timing cannot be cured within such time period (provided that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein);

 

(iv) if the Hudson Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained
at the Hudson Shareholder Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement
thereof at which a vote on the adoption of this Agreement was taken; or

 



\- 64 -  (v) if the MandT Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at
the MandT Shareholder Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof at
which a vote on the adoption of this Agreement was taken; or

(c) by MandT, if (i) prior to such time as the Hudson Shareholder
Approval is obtained, Hudson or the Board of Directors of Hudson (A)
submits this Agreement to its shareholders without a recommendation for
approval, or otherwise withdraws or materially and adversely modifies (or
discloses its intention to withdraw or materially and adversely modify) its
recommendation as contemplated by Section 6.3(a), or recommends to its
shareholders an Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger, or (B) materially
breaches its obligations (x) to call a shareholder meeting pursuant to Section
6.3, (y) to prepare and mail to its shareholders the Joint Proxy Statement
pursuant to Section 6.1(a) or (z) under Section 6.8; or (ii) a tender offer or
exchange offer for 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Hudson Common
Stock is commenced (other than by MandT or a Subsidiary thereof), and the Board
of Directors of Hudson recommends that the shareholders of Hudson tender their
shares in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise fails to recommend that
such stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within the 10
Business Day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b) or (c)
of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such termination to the other
party in accordance with Section 9.5, specifying the provision or provisions
hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected.

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of
this Agreement by either Hudson or MandT as provided in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Hudson,
MandT, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors
of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever under this
Agreement, or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except that (i) Sections 6.2(b), 8.2, 8.3, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9,
9.10, 9.11, 9.12, 9.14 and 9.15 shall survive any termination of this
Agreement, and (ii) neither Hudson nor MandT shall be relieved or released from
any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or knowing breach of any
provision of this Agreement (which, in the case of Hudson, shall include the
loss to the holders of Hudson Common Stock of the economic benefits of the
Merger, including the loss of the premium offered to the shareholders of
Hudson).

 

Section 8.3 _Termination Fee_.

(a) In the event that:

 

(i) (x) prior to the Effective Time and after the date hereof, any
person shall have made an Acquisition Proposal, which proposal has been
publicly disclosed and not withdrawn or has been made known to senior
management of Hudson, or any person shall have publicly announced or made
known to senior management of Hudson an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal, (y) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by either party pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii) without the Hudson
Shareholder Approval having been 

 



\- 65 -   obtained or Section 8.1(b)(iv) or by MandT pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) and
(z) within 18 months after the termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been consummated or any definitive agreement with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal shall have been entered into (provided that for
purposes of the foregoing, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.8(b) except that the references to
"20%" in the definition of an "Acquisition Proposal" in Section 6.8(b) shall
be deemed to be references to "50%"); or

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by MandT pursuant to Section 8.1(c); 

then Hudson shall pay MandT a fee, in immediately available funds, in the amount
of $125,000,000 (the " _Hudson Termination Fee_ ") (A) in the case of a
Hudson Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.3(a)(i), immediately
following the earlier of the execution of a definitive agreement with respect
to, or the consummation of, any Acquisition Proposal, and (B) in the case of
a Hudson Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.3(a)(ii), as promptly
as reasonably practicable after termination (and, in any event, within three
Business Days thereof). In no event shall Hudson be obligated to pay MandT the
Hudson Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either party
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(v) and MandT shall be in material breach of its
obligations under Section 6.3(b), then MandT shall pay Hudson a fee, in
immediately available funds, in the amount of $125,000,000 (the " _M andT
Termination Fee_") as promptly as reasonably practicable after termination
(and, in any event, within three Business Days thereof). In no event shall MandT
be obligated to pay Hudson the MandT Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(c) Hudson and MandT acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither party would enter into
this Agreement. The amounts payable by Hudson pursuant to Section 8.3(b)
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty and shall be the sole
monetary remedy of MandT in the event of termination of this Agreement specified
in such section. In the event that either party fails to pay when due any
amounts payable under this Section 8.3, then (i) such party shall reimburse
the other party for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and
reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such
overdue amount, and (ii) such party shall pay to the other party interest on
such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date that such
overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that
such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal
to the prime rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such
payment was required to be made.

remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

  



\- 71 -  Section 9.12 _Disclosure Schedule_. Before entry into this Agreement,
Hudson delivered to MandT a schedule (a " _Hudson Disclosure Schedule_ ") and
MandT delivered to Hudson a schedule (a " _M andT Disclosure Schedule_"), in each

necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained in Article III or Article IV, as
applicable, or to one or more covenants contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
(i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to
a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect and (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not
be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Previously Disclosed_ " means, as applicable, information set
forth (i) by Hudson in the applicable section of the Hudson Disclosure
Schedule, or any other section of the Hudson Disclosure Schedule (so long as
it is reasonably clear from the context that the disclosure in such other
section of the Hudson Disclosure Schedule is also applicable to the section of
this Agreement in question) or (ii) by MandT in the applicable section of the
MandT Disclosure Schedule, or any other section of the MandT Disclosure Schedule
(so long as it is reasonably clear from the context that the disclosure in
such other section of the MandT Disclosure Schedule is also applicable to the
section of this Agreement in question).

 

Section 9.13 _Expenses_. Except (i) with respect to costs and expenses
of printing and mailing the Joint Proxy Statement and all filing and other
fees paid to the SEC in connection with the Merger, which shall be borne
equally by Hudson and MandT, (ii) all filing and other fees in connection with
any filing under the HSR Act, which shall be borne by MandT, and (iii) as
otherwise provided in Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger, this Agreement, and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated.

Section 9.14   _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or
portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner
as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or
portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and
this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction
as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any
provision had never been contained herein.
