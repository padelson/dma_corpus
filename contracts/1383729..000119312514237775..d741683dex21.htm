v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of June 16, 2014 by and among SanDisk Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Flight Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Fusion-io,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). All capitalized terms that
are used in this Agreement but not defined herein shall have the respective
meanings ascribed thereto in Annex A.

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, in order to effect the foregoing acquisition, Parent and the Company
have agreed that Merger Sub shall commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ")
to acquire all of the outstanding Company Shares at a price of eleven Dollars
and twenty five cents ($11.25) per Company Share, net to the holder thereof in
cash, without interest (such amount, or any higher amount per Company Share
that may be paid pursuant to the Offer, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Offer Price_ "), all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;

 

WHEREAS, in order to complete the foregoing acquisition, as soon as
practicable following the completion of the Offer, Merger Sub will be merged
with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with the DGCL and
each Company Share (other than Company Shares owned by the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub or Dissenting Company Shares) that is not tendered and
accepted pursuant to the Offer will thereupon be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, and the
Company will survive the Merger as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, all
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, the parties intend for the Merger to be effected under Section 253 or
Section 251(h) of the DGCL pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;

WHEREAS, each of the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub
has approved the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub,
respectively, of this Agreement, the performance by Parent and Merger Sub,
respectively, of their respective covenants and agreements contained herein
and the consummation of the Offer and the Merger upon the terms and subject
to the conditions contained herein;

WHEREAS, the Company Board has unanimously (i) determined that it is in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable,
to enter into this Agreement, (ii) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, taken
together, are at a price and on terms that are fair to, and in the best
interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders, (iii) approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer
and the Merger, and the Support Agreements (as defined below), which
approval, to the extent applicable, constituted approval under the provisions
of Section 203 of the DGCL as a result of which this Agreement   and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the
Merger) as well as the Support Agreements and the transactions contemplated
thereby, are not and will not be subject to the provisions of, or any
restrictions under, the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, and (iv)
resolved to recommend that the Company Stockholders accept the Offer, tender
their Company Shares to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer;

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter
into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company, in their respective
capacities as stockholders of the Company, are entering into Support
Agreements with Parent (each, a " _Support Agreement_ " and collectively, the
" _Support Agreements_ ") pursuant to which the signatories thereto are
agreeing to, subject to the terms and conditions of such agreements, tender
their Company Shares into the Offer and to take (and refrain from taking)
certain other actions in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to prescribe certain
conditions with respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, as
well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

(not including, for the avoidance of doubt, the business and operation of the
Surviving Corporation and any of its Subsidiaries); (B) any of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.1(a)_ (Organization

of such date (other than any such representation or warranty that is made only

specified date), except solely in the case of this clause (C), if one or more
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties set forth in paragraph (a)
(other than the last sentence of paragraph (a)), paragraph (b) (other than the
third sentence of paragraph (b)) or paragraph (d) of _Section 3.5_ would not
cause the consideration otherwise payable to the holders of Company Securities
by Parent and/or Merger Sub in the Offer and the Merger to increase by
$5,000,000 or more; or (D) any of the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in this Agreement (other than the Specified Representations,

disregarding any "materiality" and "Company Material Adverse Effect"
qualifications set forth in all such representations or warranties, shall not
have been true and correct as of the date of this Agreement or shall not be

immediately prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer; provided, that for
purposes of this _Section 1.1(b)(v)_, clause (ii) of the Company Material

4 (vi) the Company shall not have delivered to Parent and Merger Sub a

6 (F) imposes conditions to the Offer that are in addition to the Offer
Conditions set forth in _Section 1.1(b)_; or

(G) extends the Offer other than in a manner pursuant to, and in
accordance with, _Section 1.1(e)_.

(ii) The Offer Price shall be automatically adjusted to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend

of the Offer, then Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to)
extend the Offer for one (1) extension period of five (5) Business Days;

(C) in the event that the Minimum Condition is the only Offer Condition that
is not satisfied or waived as of any then scheduled expiration of the Offer,
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer for
two (2) successive extension periods of ten (10) Business Days each in order
to further seek to satisfy the Minimum Condition;

 



7 (D) in the event that any of the Offer Conditions (other than the

case immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise) (" _Canceled Company Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

Effective Time and held by stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor
of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly and
validly exercised and perfected their statutory rights of appraisal in
respect of such Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, " _Dissenting_

 



15   _Company Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to
receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.6_. Such
stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by
stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares
under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that formerly
evidenced such Company Shares in the manner provided in _Section 2.7_.

 

(B) The Company shall give Parent (1) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (2) the opportunity and right (at
Parents election) to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law in respect of
Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for
payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

(b) _Exchange Fund_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) the aggregate Merger Consideration with the
Payment Agent, for payment to the Company Stockholders pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_ (such cash amount being referred to herein as
the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates
(the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Company Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding Company Shares (other than Canceled Company
Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Payment Agent)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to the

 



16  provisions of this _Article II_. Upon (i) surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or (ii)
receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence,
if any, of the transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the
case of a transfer of Book-Entry Shares, the holders of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Payment Agent to pay, in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of each Company Share formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ , and the
Certificates so surrendered or Book-Entry Shares so transferred shall
forthwith be canceled. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as
the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on
the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of such Certificates or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.7_. Until so
surrendered or transferred, outstanding Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article II_.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
Company Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than that in
which the surrendered Certificate or transferred Book-Entry Shares
are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the
Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate or transferred Book-Entry Shares are
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such
Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender
and transfer or such Book-Entry Shares are properly transferred and the Person
requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by
Parent) any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment
of Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, or established to the satisfaction of Parent
(or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer or other similar Taxes
have been paid or are otherwise not payable.

(e)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this _Article II_ ;
provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect
to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(f) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Merger Sub, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under U.S. federal or state, local or
non-U.S. law. To the extent that such amounts are

 



17  so deducted or withheld and remitted to the applicable Governmental
Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

(h) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares on the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent (or its designee) upon demand, and any Company
Stockholders who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or
transferred their Book-Entry Shares evidencing such Company Shares for
exchange pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 2.7_ shall thereafter
look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company
Shares evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares solely to Parent,
as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Merger
Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions
of this _Article II_.

 

2.8 _Necessary Further Action_. In the event that, at any time from and after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors
and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall take all such lawful and
necessary action on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub to accomplish the
foregoing. From and after the Effective Time, the directors and officers of
the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the
Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of
the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

text of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other

and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

3.1 _Organization and Good Standing_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under Delaware Law. The Company has the requisite corporate power
and authority to carry on its business as it is presently being conducted and
to own, lease or operate its properties and assets. The Company is duly
licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the
nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent the
"good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside
the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has set forth in Section 3.1(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule a true and complete list of each jurisdiction in which it
is qualified to do business.

(b) The Company has made available to Parent (i) true, correct and complete
copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other constituent
governing documents, as amended to date, of the Company, and (ii) true,
correct and complete copies in all material respects of the minutes (or,
in the case of draft minutes, the most recent drafts thereof) of all
meetings, and any action taken by written consent, of the Company
Stockholders, the Company Board and each committee of the Company Board,
excluding any minutes related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case occurring at any time during the three (3)
years prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company is not in violation of
its certificate of incorporation or bylaws in any material respect.

3.2 _Authorization and Enforceability_.

 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and, assuming the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated in accordance with Section 251(h) or Section 253 of
the DGCL, and assuming the accuracy of Parents and Merger Subs
representation and warranty set forth in _Section 4.6_, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and to perform its obligations hereunder.

 



19 (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger) have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no additional
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions, assuming the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated in accordance with
Section 251(h) or Section 253 of the DGCL, and assuming the accuracy of
Parents and Merger Subs representations and warranties set forth in _Section
4.2_ and _Section 4.6_, contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the
Merger).

 

(c) The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Company Shares is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of
Company Capital Stock that, absent Section 251(h) of the DGCL, would have been
necessary under applicable Law and the Companys certificate of incorporation
and bylaws to adopt, approve or authorize this Agreement and consummate
the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby in their capacity as
stockholders of the Company.

(d) At a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the Company Board has, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, (i) unanimously determined that it is in the best interests
of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into
this Agreement, (ii) unanimously determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, taken
together, are fair to, and in the best interests of the Company and
the Company Stockholders, (iii) unanimously resolved that this Agreement and
the Merger be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL and that, assuming the
accuracy of Parents and Merger Subs representation and warranty set forth
in  _Section 4.6_, the Merger shall be consummated as soon as practicable
following the Acceptance Time and that the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger) as well as the Support Agreements and the
transactions contemplated thereby, are not subject to the provisions of, or
any restrictions under, the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, and (iv)
unanimously resolved to recommend that the Company Stockholders accept the
Offer, and tender their Company Shares to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer
(the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "). Prior to making the determinations
and effecting the approvals set forth in this _Section 3.2(d)_, the Company
has received the opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP to the effect that, based
upon and subject to the various qualifications and assumptions set forth
therein, on the date of such opinion, the consideration to be paid to the
holders of the Company Shares (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates)
pursuant to the Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.

(e) Assuming that the representations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in
_Section 4.6_ are accurate, the Company Board has taken all necessary actions
so that the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of
the DGCL and any other similar applicable anti-takeover Law are not
applicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger) or the Support Agreements or the
transactions contemplated thereby. No other state takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation applies or purports to apply to the Offer, the Merger,
the Support Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and
no "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other similar
anti-takeover statute or regulation or any anti-takeover provision in the
Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws is applicable to the Company
Shares, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



20 (f) At a meeting duly called and held at which all members of the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board (the " _Compensation Committee_ ") were
present, the Compensation Committee (i) duly and unanimously adopted
resolutions approving as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, (A) each Company Stock Plan, (B) the
treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs in accordance with the terms set
forth in this Agreement, the applicable Company Stock Plan and any applicable
Employee Plan, (C) the terms of _Section 6.9_, and (D) each other Employee
Plan that under the terms of this Agreement is required to be set forth in
Section 3.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule which resolutions have not
been rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way, and (ii) has taken all other
actions necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to
the foregoing arrangements. Each member of the Compensation Committee is an
"independent director" within the meaning of the requirements of Rule
14d-10(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(g) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger
Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability (i) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of
equity.

 

3.3 _Required Governmental Consents_. No consent, approval, Order or
authorization of, or filing or registration with, or notification to (any of
the foregoing being a " _Consent_ ") any Governmental Authority, is required
on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Offer and the Merger), except (a) the filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and such filings
with any other Governmental Authorities to satisfy the applicable Laws of
states and foreign jurisdictions in which the Company and its Subsidiaries are
qualified to do business, (b) such filings and approvals as may be required by
any federal or state securities Laws, including compliance with any
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, (c) Consents required under, and
compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and applicable
foreign Antitrust Laws and (d) such other Consents, the failure of which to
obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

3.4  _Conflicts_. The execution, delivery or performance by the Company of
this Agreement, the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) and the compliance by
the Company with any of the provisions hereof do not and will not (a)
violate, conflict with or result in the breach of or constitute a default
under any provision of the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other
constituent governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(b) subject to obtaining such Consents set forth in Section 3.4(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, violate, conflict with, or result in the breach
of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or 

 



21  lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or result in the
termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a
right of termination or acceleration under, any Material Contract, (c)

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of each of clauses

currently conducted, all of which rights (other than with respect

afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or take any other action intended to

make or has made any proposal or transaction that constitutes or may
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Transaction, (iii) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of

any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) terminate, amend, waive or fail to enforce any
rights under any "standstill" or other similar agreement between the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and any Person (other than Parent), provided,

provide a consent under any "standstill" to permit a party to make a
confidential Acquisition Proposal in compliance with the requirements of this
Agreement, including _Section 6.1(d)_, or (v) waive the applicability of all
or any portion of Section 203 of the DGCL in respect of any Person (other
than Parent and its Affiliates) in relation to any Acquisition Proposal or

(c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_, prior to
the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may, directly or indirectly through
advisors, agents or other intermediaries, (A) engage or participate in
discussions or negotiations with any Person that has made (and not withdrawn)
a _bona fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor of nationally
recognized standing and its outside legal counsel) constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) furnish to any Person
that has made (and not withdrawn) a _bona fide_ ,

 



56  written Acquisition Proposal any non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement the
terms of which are no less favorable to the Company than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (which confidentiality agreement shall not
include any provisions that would prevent or restrict the Company or the
Company Representatives from providing any information to Parent to which
Parent would be entitled under any provision of this Agreement and shall not
be required to include a direct or indirect standstill); provided, however,
that in the case of any action taken pursuant to the foregoing clauses (A) or
(B), (1) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have breached
or violated in any material respect the terms of this _Section 6.1_ or
_Section 6.2_ with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, any other
Acquisition Proposal made by the same Person or an Affiliate of such Person,
or otherwise in favor of such Person or an Affiliate of such Person (2) the
Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company
Stockholders under Delaware Law, (3) prior to taking any of the actions set
forth in clauses (A) or (B), the Company gives Parent written notice
containing the information set forth in _Section 6.1(d)_, and of the
Companys intention to take such actions and (4) contemporaneously with
furnishing any non-public information to such Person, the Company furnishes
such non-public information to Parent (to the extent such information has not
been previously furnished by the Company to Parent). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge
and hereby agree that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 6.1_ by any Company Representative shall constitute a breach of this
_Section 6.1_ by the Company.

 

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
6.1(b)_, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in all
cases within twenty four (24) hours of its receipt, advise Parent in writing
of (i) any _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information
that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Transaction or (iii) any inquiry that would reasonably be expected
to lead to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, in each case,
including the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Transaction, request or inquiry (unless such Acquisition Proposal
is in written form, in which case the Company shall give Parent a copy
thereof), and the identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent promptly and
reasonably informed of the status, (including all material amendments or
proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. In
addition to the foregoing, the Company shall provide Parent with at least
twenty-four (24) hours (or such lesser notice as the Company Board or
committee receives) prior written notice of a meeting of the Company Board at
which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, an inquiry relating to a potential
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, or a request to provide
nonpublic information to any Person in relation to an Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Transaction.

6.2 _Company Board Recommendation_.

 

(a) Unless the Company Board shall have withheld, withdrawn, amended,
qualified or modified the Company Board Recommendation in accordance with
this _Section 6.2_, the Company Board shall (i) make the Company Board
Recommendation and (ii) include the Company Board Recommendation (with respect
to the Offer) in the Schedule 14D-9 and permit Parent to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents.

 



57 (b) Subject to the terms of this _Section 6.2_, neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) fail to make, withhold, withdraw, amend,
qualify or modify, or propose to refuse to make, withhold, withdraw, amend,
qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, endorse or
recommend an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, (iii) fail to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, or (iv)
resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any of the foregoing actions (any
action described in the preceding clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) being
referred to herein as a " _Company Board Recommendation Change_ "); provided,
however, that, none of the following shall be deemed to be a Company Board
Recommendation Change: (A) a "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Company Board pursuant to and in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange
Act, provided that it also includes an express reaffirmation of the Company
Board Recommendation, or (B) the approval or delivery of either (1) a
Subsequent Determination Notice or (2) an Intervening Event Notice.

(c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in this _Section 6.2_, the
Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal described in the following clause (i) at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, if (i) the Company Board has received a _bona
fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal that
has not been withdrawn, (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has breached or violated in any material respect the provisions of _Section
6.1_ or this _Section 6.2_ with respect to such Acquisition Proposal or any
Person making such Acquisition Proposal (whether or not related to such
Acquisition Proposal), (iii) the Company Board has determined in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel and after considering any
counter-offer or proposal made by Parent pursuant to clause (v) below), that,
in light of the foregoing Superior Proposal, the failure by the Company Board
to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected
to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders
under Delaware Law, (iv) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company Board shall have given Parent at least four (4) Business
Days prior written notice that the Company intends to take such action (a "
_Subsequent Determination Notice_ "), which notice shall attach such Superior
Proposal and state expressly the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal and all the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal in
reasonable detail and the opportunity to meet with representatives of the
Company Board and its outside legal counsel to discuss a modification of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be effected and (v) Parent shall not have made, within four (4)
Business Days after its receipt of the Companys Subsequent Determination
Notice, an irrevocable counter-offer or proposal capable of being accepted by
the Company that the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized standing and
its outside legal counsel) is at least as favorable to Company Stockholders as
such Superior Proposal (it being understood and hereby agreed that
every subsequent material revision or material modification to any such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Subsequent Determination Notice pursuant
to the preceding clause (iv) and a new two (2) Business Day "matching" period
under the preceding clauses (iv) and (v) following the initial four (4)
Business Day "matching" period). The Company shall keep confidential any such
counter-offers or proposals made by Parent to revise 

 



58  the terms of this Agreement, other than in the event of any amendment to
this Agreement and to the extent required to be disclosed in any SEC Reports
or applicable Law or stock exchange listing requirement.

(d) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.2(b)_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, the Company Board may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change at any time prior to the Acceptance Time in response to
an Intervening Event if (i) an Intervening Event has occurred, (ii) the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure
by the Company Board to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to
the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law, (iii) prior to effecting such
Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall have given Parent
at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice thereof (an "
_Intervening Event Notice_ "), which notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the material facts underlying the Company Boards determination that an
Intervening Event has occurred and the rationale and basis for such Company
Board Recommendation Change (it being understood and agreed that any material
change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening Event shall
require a new written notice by the Company to Parent in compliance with this
clause (iii) and a new three (3) Business Day period under clause (iv) below)
and the opportunity to meet with the Companys outside legal counsel, all with
the purpose and intent of enabling Parent and the Company to discuss in good
faith a modification of the terms and conditions of this Agreement so as to
obviate the need to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change on the basis
of such Intervening Event so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
effected, and (iv) following the expiration of such three (3) Business Day
period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) and after giving consideration to any
offer or proposal from Parent, that, in light of such Intervening Event, the
failure by the Company Board to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to
the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law.

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and
disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions
of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, provided that, in each case,
any statement(s) made by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a), Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts to Complete_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done (and to assist and cooperate with
the other party or parties hereto in doing), all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Offer and the Merger) as expeditiously as reasonably practicable in accordance
with the terms hereof, including using reasonable best efforts to (a) subject
to _Section 6.4(b)_, cause the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Section
1.1(b)_ and the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Section 2.2(b)_ to be
satisfied or fulfilled as soon as reasonably practicable, (b) obtain all
necessary or appropriate consents, 

 



59  waivers and approvals under any Material Contracts requested to be obtained
by Parent so as to maintain and preserve the benefits under such Material
Contracts following the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger), (c) subject to _Section 6.4(b)_, obtain
all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, Orders and
authorizations from Governmental Authorities, the expiration or termination
of any applicable waiting periods, making all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations and filings
with Governmental Authorities, if any) necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger), and (d)
execute or deliver any additional instruments reasonably necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement.

6.4 _Regulatory Approvals_.

 

(a) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.3_, as soon as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) following the
date hereof, each of Parent and the Company shall file with the FTC and the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger) as required by the HSR Act, and Parent shall file comparable pre-
merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any Governmental
Authority that is required by the Antitrust Laws of the
Specified Jurisdiction. Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to promptly (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the
making of such filings, (ii) supply the other with any information or
documents that may be required in order to effectuate such filings, and (iii)
comply with any request for additional information made by the FTC, the DOJ or
the competition or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction. Each
party hereto shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the
case may be, of any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer
and the Merger). If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request
for additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger), then such party shall use reasonable
best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable
and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request. Neither Parent nor the Company shall commit or
agree (or permit their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to commit or
agree) with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll or extend any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws, without
the prior written consent of the other (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). Parent shall have the right to direct, lead, and make
final decisions regarding all communications with any Governmental Authority
and strategy relating to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws of any
other jurisdiction in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
consistent with its obligations hereunder, subject to prior good faith
consultation with the Company.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries may not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order to (i) sell, license, assign,
transfer, divest, hold

 



60  separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, (ii) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
change the assets, business or portion of business of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in any manner, or (iii) impose any restriction, requirement or
limitation on the operation of the business or portion of the business of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries; provided that, if requested by Parent, the Company
will become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any such requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or order so long as such requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order is only binding on the Company
in the event the Closing occurs.

6.5 _Anti-Takeover Statutes_. Without limiting the generality of the
provisions of _Section 6.4_, in the event that any state anti-takeover or
other similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Offer and the Merger), the Company, at the direction of the Company Board,
shall use reasonable best efforts to take action to make such state anti-
takeover or other similar statute or regulation inapplicable so that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger) may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger).

6.6 _Access to Books, Records, Properties and Personnel_. At all times during
the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article VII_  and the Acceptance Time, the Company shall afford
Parent and its accountants, legal counsel and other representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the
properties, books and records and personnel of the Company; provided,
however, that no information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any
investigation conducted pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall affect or be
deemed to modify or waive (i) any right or claim of the Parent or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to any representation or warranty of
the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company set forth herein, or (ii) any
condition to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or the
remedies available to the parties hereunder; and provided further, that the
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any
information provided to Parent pursuant to this  _Section 6.6_. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or
to disclose information where such access or disclosure would contravene any
law, rule, regulation, Order, judgment, decree, or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement or would reasonably be expected to
violate or result in a loss or impairment of any attorney-client or work
product privilege. The parties will use reasonable best efforts to
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 



61 6.7 _Notification Obligations_.

 

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall give reasonably prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub

Proceedings have commenced, or to the Companys Knowledge, threatened,

transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that no such
notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or

of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties
hereunder; and provided further, that the terms and conditions of the

to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or the remedies
available to the parties hereunder; and provided further, that the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information
provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.7(b)_.

 

(c) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Effective
Time, Parent shall give reasonably prompt notice to the Company (i) upon
becoming aware (A) that any representation or warranty made by it or Merger
Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, or (B) of any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in

 



62  the case of clauses (A) and (B) if as a result of such breach the closing

commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its directors
by any Company Stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company)

informed regarding any such litigation.

regarding the defense or settlement of any litigation filed against the
Company or any of its directors or officers in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), shall reasonably consider Parents views with respect to such
litigation and shall not settle any such litigation without the prior written
consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

6.9 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Unvested Company Options._ At the Offer Closing, each outstanding Company
Option that is unvested, unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately
before the Offer Closing, has an exercise price of less than the Offer Price
(each an " _Unvested Company Option_ "), and is held by a Person who is, as of
immediately prior to the Offer Closing, an employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, in each case, as of immediately before the Offer
Closing shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically at the Offer
Closing into that number of Parent Options equal to (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) the product of (A) the number of shares of Company
Shares subject to such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Offer
Closing, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, each with an exercise price
applicable to the Parent Option (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal
to the per share exercise price applicable to the Unvested Company Option as
of immediately

 



63  before the Offer Closing divided by the Exchange Ratio; provided, however,
that in no case shall the exchange of a Company Option be performed in a
manner that is not in compliance with the adjustment requirements of Sections
409A and 424(a) of the Code. The term, vesting schedule and all of the other
provisions applicable to such assumed Company Options shall remain unchanged,
subject only to any adjustments required for administrative convenience to
conform such vesting schedule to the vesting schedules otherwise specified by
Parents equity incentive plans and that are not adverse to the holder thereof
and any adjustments to performance metrics or goals applicable to such
assumed Company Options.

(b) _Vested Company Options_. At the Offer Closing, each Company Option that
is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately before the Offer
Closing and which is vested and exercisable as of immediately before the Offer
Closing and each Company Option that is held by any Person who is not as of
immediately prior to the Offer Closing an employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (after giving effect to any vesting that occurs on account of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or pursuant to an Employee
Plan in effect as of the date hereof) and that has a per share exercise price
less than the Offer Price (each a " _Vested Company Option_ ") shall be
cancelled in exchange for a cash payment from Parent as soon as practicable
(but in any event within fifteen (15) days) following the Offer Closing to
the holder thereof equal to the number of shares of Company Shares with
respect to which such option is vested and exercisable as of immediately
before the Offer Closing (after giving effect to any vesting that occurs on
account of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or pursuant to an
Employee Plan) multiplied by the excess, if any, of (1) Offer Price, over (2)
the per share exercise price for such option. On and after the Offer Closing
the Vested Company Options shall terminate and cease to be outstanding.

(c) _Other Company Options_. Effective as of the Offer Closing, each Company
Option (or portion thereof) that is outstanding, unvested and unexercised as
of the Offer Closing and which is not an Unvested Company Option assumed by
Parent and converted automatically pursuant to _Section 6.9(a)_ or a Vested
Company Option cancelled pursuant to _Section 6.9(b)_, shall be cancelled
without the payment of any consideration therefor.

 

(d) _Company RSUs_. Effective as of the Offer Closing, each Company RSU that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Offer Closing (after giving
effect to any vesting that occurs on account of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or pursuant to any Employee Plan) shall be assumed by Parent
as a Parent RSU. Each Company RSU so assumed by Parent pursuant to this 
_Section 6.9(d)_ shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms
and conditions (including vesting terms) set forth in the applicable Company
Stock Plan and the Company RSU agreements relating thereto, as in effect
immediately prior to the Offer Closing, except that such assumed Company RSU
shall cover that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product of the number of Company Shares underlying such Company RSU
immediately prior to the Offer Closing multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, with
the result rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock.

(e)  _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Effective as of no later than
immediately preceding the Offer Closing, the Company shall have terminated the
Company ESPP and shall have provided such notice of termination as may be
required by the terms of the Company ESPP. As soon as practicable following
the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if

 



64  appropriate, any committee administering the Companys ESPP) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to provide
that, with respect to the ESPP: (i) each individual participating in the
Purchase Period (as defined in the ESPP) in progress as of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Final Purchase Period_ ") shall not be permitted (A) to
increase the amount of his or her rate of payroll contributions thereunder
from the rate in effect when the Final Purchase Period commenced, or (B) to
make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or following the date
of this Agreement; (ii) no individual who is not participating in the ESPP as
of the date of this Agreement may commence participation in the ESPP following
the date of this Agreement; (iii) the Final Purchase Period shall end on the
earlier to occur of September 1, 2014 and a date that is at least five (5)
calendar days prior to the initial scheduled expiration of the Offer; (iv)
each ESPP participants accumulated contributions under the ESPP shall be used
to purchase Company Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESPP as of the
end of the Final Purchase Period; and (v) the ESPP shall be suspended
immediately following the end of the Final Purchase Period and shall terminate
prior to the Offer Closing. During the suspension period no further rights
shall be granted or exercised under the ESPP.

(f) _Implementation_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section 6.9_
under the Company Stock Plans, all Company Option agreements, all Company RSU
agreements, the Company ESPP and any other plan or arrangement of the Company,
including delivering all required notices and making any determinations
and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof. Parent shall
take all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to have available for
issuance or transfer a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
delivery upon exercise of the assumed Company Options and assumed Company
RSUs.

(g) _Form S-8_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no
event later than ten (10) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent
shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (if
available for use by Parent) registering the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all assumed Company Options and
settlement of assumed Company RSUs, in each case that are eligible to be
registered on Form S-8.

 

6.10 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k)
plan(s) shall not be terminated, the Company shall terminate any and all
401(k) plans maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliates, in each case
effective as of the day immediately preceding the date the Company becomes a
member of the same Controlled Group of Corporations (as defined in Section
414(b) of the Code) as Parent (the " _401(k) Termination Date_ "). The
Company shall provide Parent evidence that the 401(k) plan(s) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the
Company Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable.
The Company shall also take such other actions in furtherance of terminating
any such 401(k) plans as Parent may reasonably request. If the 401(k) plan of
the Company is terminated pursuant hereto as of the 401(k) Termination Date,
Parent shall permit employees of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries who
are employed as of the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") to roll
over their account balances (including loan notes) to a 401(k) plan of Parent
or an Affiliate.

 



65 (b) For the twelve (12) month period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide (or cause any of its Subsidiaries to provide) employee benefits
to each Continuing Employee who remains employed by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee
benefits (excluding equity and equity-based compensation) provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent. To the extent employee benefits are
provided under the employee benefit plans of Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
(the " _Parent Employee Plans_ "), from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to, or to cause one of its Subsidiaries to,
cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length
of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance pay entitlement); provided, however, that such service need not
be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or
benefits with respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Continuing Employee shall
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all Parent Employee Plans to the extent coverage under any such Parent
Employee Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Employee Plan in which such
Continuing Employee satisfied any applicable waiting time requirements and
participates immediately before the Effective Time; and (ii) for purposes of
each Parent Employee Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision
and/or disability benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Parent shall (and
Parent shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to) use reasonable best efforts to
(x) cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of
insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of
such Parent Employee Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents solely to the extend waiver under the applicable
Employee Plan and (y) use reasonable best efforts to cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents under an applicable Employee Plan on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding Parent Employee Plan begins to be given
full credit under such Parent Employee Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Parent
Employee Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time. 

(c) Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Company Board
Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 6.2_, the Company shall
consult in good faith with Parent, and give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent in respect thereof, prior to
sending any written communications (including electronic communications) to
any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries regarding this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer
or the Merger). In addition, except in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, the Company shall not make any material
representations or material commitments to any employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that would bind Parent or the Company following the
Closing, solely in their capacity as employees, without the prior written
consent of Parent.

(d) The Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) comply with all
applicable provisions of the Transfer Regulations and other similar country-
specific legal

 



66  standards or applicable Laws in respect of all Continuing Employees. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the preceding sentence, the Company shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) comply with all required obligations
under the Transfer Regulations and other similar country-specific legal
standards or applicable Laws, or as otherwise requested by Parent, to notify
and/or consult with the Continuing Employees or the applicable employee
representatives, unions, works councils or other employee representative
bodies, if any, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed of such
notifications and/or consultations. " _Transfer Regulations_ " means the
Council Directive 77/187/EEC of 14 February 1977 on the approximation of the
laws of the Member States of the European Union relating to the safeguarding
of employees rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or
parts of businesses, as amended, and the legislation and regulations of any
Member States of the European Union implementing the foregoing.

(e) This _Section 6.10_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section
6.10_ express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
_Section 6.10_ or is intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an
amendment to or modification of the Employee Plans or any other employee
benefit plan or arrangement of the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates or limit in any way the right of the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Employee Plan or
any other employee benefit plans or arrangements. Nothing in this _Section
6.10_ shall limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at
any time following the Effective Time.

 

6.11 _Company Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor
and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under their respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws
(and other similar organizational documents) and all indemnification
agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective current or former directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or
agents (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") in effect on the date of this
Agreement and disclosed in Section 6.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(the " _Indemnification Agreements_ ") for a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time. During such period, Parent shall not, nor shall it permit
the Surviving Corporation to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify
such provisions for indemnification in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of any individual who at any time on or prior to the
Effective Time was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of
Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of actions or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), unless such modification is required by Law; provided,
however _,_ that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made either
prior to the Effective Time or within such six (6)-year period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until
disposition of any and all such claims. Any Indemnification Agreements shall
be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without any further
action, and shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

  



67 (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering
each person covered by the DandO Insurance as of the date of this Agreement, on
terms with respect to the coverage and amounts no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than those of the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this
Agreement; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation may, at its
option, substitute therefor policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries containing terms with respect to coverage
and amounts no less favorable, in the aggregate, to such persons than the DandO
Insurance, provided further, however, that in satisfying its obligations under
this _Section 6.11(b)_ Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of two hundred fifty percent
(250%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal
year (such two hundred fifty percent (250%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual
Premium_ ") (which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set
forth in Section 6.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), provided, that
if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail"
prepaid policy (the " _Tail Policy_ ") on the DandO Insurance on terms and
conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the DandO Insurance and for
an amount not to exceed two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the amount
paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year. In the event
that the Company does not purchase the Tail Policy, Parent may purchase a Tail
Policy on the DandO Insurance on terms and conditions no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than the DandO Insurance. In the event that the Company purchases
such a Tail Policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such Tail Policy in full force and effect
and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all
other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first
sentence of this _Section 6.11(b)_ for so long as such Tail Policy shall be
maintained in full force and effect.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation set forth in this _Section 6.11_.

 

(d) Except as required by applicable Law, the obligations under this _Section
6.11_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party (or any other person who
is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in
_Section 6.11(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior
written consent of such affected Company Indemnified Party or other person who
is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in
_Section 6.11(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the Company
Indemnified Parties or other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section 6.11(b)_ (and their
heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries 

 



68  of this _Section 6.11_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party
thereto. The rights of the Company Indemnified Parties (and other persons who
are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in
_Section 6.11(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section
6.11_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
that such persons may have under the certificate or articles of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and
all Indemnification Agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

6.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of Company Shares
(including derivative securities with respect to such shares) that are treated
as dispositions under such rule and result from the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby by each director or officer of the
Company who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company.

 

6.13 _Compensation Committee Approval of New Compensation Arrangements_. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company (acting through its Compensation
Committee) will take all steps that may be necessary or advisable to cause
each compensation arrangement entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on or after the date of this Agreement to be approved by the
Compensation Committee (comprised solely of "independent directors"
determined within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d) promulgated under the Exchange
Act) as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) promulgated under the
Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

 

6.14 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

6.15 _Public Disclosure and Other Communications_. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall consult with each other, and to the extent reasonably
practicable, agree, before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger), and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except (A) as may be required by applicable Law or any listing
agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case, to the extent
reasonably practicable and as permitted by applicable Law, reasonable best
efforts to consult with the other party hereto shall be made prior to any such
release or public statement or (B) in connection with any actions by the
Company or Company Board permitted by  _Section 6.2(c)_, _6.2(d)_ or
_6.2(e)_ or in connection with any actions by Parent or Merger Sub in response
to or as a result of any actions by the Company or Company Board permitted by
_Section 6.2(c)_, _6.2(d)_  or _6.2(e)_. The press release announcing this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be jointly
agreed by Parent and the Company.

written notice of such termination to the other party or parties hereto):

(a) by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company;

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Offer shall have expired or been
terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Offer
without Merger Sub (or Parent on Merger Subs behalf) having accepted for
payment any Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section

resulted (i) in any of the Offer Conditions having failed to be satisfied, or
(ii) in the expiration or termination of the Offer in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the Offer without Merger Sub (or Parent on Merger
Subs behalf) having accepted for payment any Company Shares tendered pursuant

constitutes a material breach of this Agreement;

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if the Acceptance Time shall not have
occurred on or before October 16, 2014 (the " _Termination Date_ "); provided
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.1(c)_ shall not be available to any party hereto whose action or failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the principal cause of or
resulted (i) in any of the Offer Conditions having failed to be satisfied on
or before the Termination Date, or (ii) in the expiration or termination of
the Offer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Offer without
Merger Sub (or Parent on Merger Subs behalf) having accepted for payment any
Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, and in either such case, such

or inaccuracy, individually or in the aggregate with other such breaches,
violations or inaccuracies, would reasonably be expected to prevent the
consummation of the Offer prior to the Termination Date; provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that such breach or failure
to perform by Parent or Merger Sub, or such inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of Parent or Merger Sub, are curable by Parent
or Merger Sub, then the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this

Company to Parent of such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy, as

(e) by Parent, in the event (i) Parent and Merger Sub are not then in material
breach of this Agreement and (ii) the Company shall have breached or
otherwise violated any of its material covenants or agreements, or other
material obligations, under this Agreement, in each case such that the Offer
Conditions set forth in _Section 1.1(b)(iv)_ would not reasonably be
expected to be satisfied as of the time of such breach (assuming for purposes
that the time of such breach was the scheduled expiration of the Offer), or
(iii) that any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
this Agreement shall have become inaccurate such that the conditions set
forth in _Section 1.1(b)(iii)_ would not be satisfied as of the time such
representation and warranty became inaccurate (assuming for such purposes that
the time of such inaccuracy was the scheduled expiration of the Offer);
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that such
breach by the Company, or such inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the Company, are curable by the Company, then Parent shall not
be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)_
until the earlier to occur of (A) thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of
written notice from Parent to the Company of such breach, failure to perform
or inaccuracy, as applicable, or (B) the termination by the Company of its
efforts to cure such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy, as applicable,

period);

(f) by Parent in the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
have breached in any material respect the provisions of _Section 6.1_ or

Proposal);

(g) by Parent in the event that (i) the Company Board or any committee
thereof shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change for any
reason (whether or not in compliance with the terms of _Section 6.1_ or
_Section 6.2_) or (ii) the Company Board shall fail to (A) publicly
recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange
offer for Company Shares within ten (10) Business Days after commencement of
such offer (and at all times thereafter during which any such tender offer or
exchange offer is pending), (B) reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within such ten (10) Business Day-period (and at all times thereafter during
which any such tender offer or exchange offer is pending) or (C) issue a
press release reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation within five (5)
Business Days following Parents written request to do so following the date
any Acquisition Proposal that is not a tender offer or exchange offer for
Company Shares or any material modification thereto is first made public or

either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority in the United
States or any other jurisdiction in which Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries has material business or operations shall have (a)
enacted, issued, promulgated, entered, enforced or deemed applicable to any of
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) any
applicable Law that has the effect of making the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger)
illegal or prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of the Offer
or the Merger, or (b) issued or granted any judgment, Order or injunction,
that has the effect of making any of the Offer or the Merger illegal or which
has the effect of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of any

the Merger) and such judgment, Order or injunction has become final and non-
appealable.

7.3 _Notice and Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) A party hereto that desires to validly terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.1_ (other than pursuant to  _Section 7.1(a)_) or _Section
7.2_ shall give notice of such termination to the other party hereto, which,
if a valid termination pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, shall be
effective immediately upon the delivery of written notice of such termination
to the other party.

(b) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect
without liability of any party or parties hereto, as applicable (or any
stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, affiliate, consultant or
other representative of such party or parties) to the other party or parties
hereto, as applicable, except (i) for the terms of _Section 6.15_, this
_Section 7.3_, _Section 7.4_, and _Article VIII_ (and any definitions
contained in any such Section and Article), each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) that nothing herein shall relieve any
party or parties hereto, as applicable, from liability for any material
and willful breach of, or fraud in connection with, this Agreement.

7.4 _Termination Fees_.

 

(a) In the event that (i) following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, a Competing
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or shall have become
publicly known, (ii) this Agreement is

 



72  thereafter terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(c)_,
and (iii) within twelve (12) months following the termination of this
Agreement, either a Competing Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the
Competing Acquisition Proposal referenced in the preceding clause (i)) is
consummated or the Company enters into a definitive acquisition agreement with
respect to a Competing Acquisition Proposal which is subsequently consummated
(whether or not the Competing Acquisition Proposal referenced in the preceding
clause (i)), then the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee), within
two (2) Business Days after the consummation of such Competing Acquisition
Proposal, a fee in the amount of $42,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee Amount_
") payable in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by Parent. " _Competing Acquisition Proposal_ "
shall have the same meaning as "Acquisition Proposal" but for this purpose
substituting 50% for all references to 15% and 85% in the related definition
of Acquisition Transaction.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(f)_ or _Section 7.1(g)_ the Company shall pay to Parent (or
its designee), within two (2) Business Days after such termination, the
Termination Fee Amount in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing by Parent.

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.1(h)_, and as a condition to the effectiveness of such
termination, the Company shall substantially simultaneously with the
occurrence of such termination pay to Parent (or its designee) the Termination
Fee Amount in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated in writing by Parent.

(d) The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that the provisions of this 
_Section 7.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger), and that, without such
provisions, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
the Company shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to
this _Section 7.4_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a
claim that results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall
promptly reimburse Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including its
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such
suit, together with interest at a rate per annum equal to the prime lending
rate prevailing during the period as published in The Wall Street Journal. In
the event that a Termination Fee Amount is paid pursuant to _Section 7.4(b)_
and _Section 7.4(c)_, Parent shall have the right, exercisable by written
notice to the Company within two (2) Business Days after the receipt of
payment of such Termination Fee Amount, to refund such Termination Fee Amount
to the Company, and in the event that the Company actually receives a full
refund of the entire Termination Fee Amount from Parent within two (2)
Business Days after the delivery of such notice to the Company, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to all remedies available as
contemplated by _Section 7.3(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, if, after receiving the Termination Fee Amount, Parent fails
to exercise its right to refund the Termination Fee Amount in accordance with
the time periods provided for in this _Section 7.4(d)_, the Termination Fee
Amount will be deemed liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the circumstances in which the Termination
Fee Amount is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunity
forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which amount would

 



73  otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and in the event that
Parent shall receive payment of the Termination Fee Amount as described in
this _Section 7.4_ (and has not refunded such amount pursuant to the terms
of this _Section 7.4(d)_), the Company shall have no further liability to
Parent or Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall have no further
liability to the Company, under this Agreement or otherwise in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that for the
avoidance of doubt, this provision shall not limit the liability of any party
under the Confidentiality Agreement. The parties hereto agree that in
no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee Amount on
more than one occasion.
