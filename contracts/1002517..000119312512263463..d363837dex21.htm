performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">10.7 <B><I>Governing Law; Venue</I></B> </FONT></P>

execution of this Agreement and, therefor, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedule hereto shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein unless the Disclosure Schedule identifies the exception with reasonable particularity and describes the
relevant facts in reasonable detail. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a document or other item shall not be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made
herein (unless the representation or warranty has to do with the existence of the document or other item itself). The parties intend that each representation, warranty and covenant contained herein shall have independent significance. If any party
has breached any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity)
that the party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or covenant. In addition, each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that any purchase price adjustment as
a result of the application of any provision of this Agreement, the Related Agreements or any of the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby does not prejudice or limit in any respect whatsoever any party&#146;s rights to indemnification
under any other provision of this Agreement, the Related Agreements or any other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby, except to the extent that such a recovery would result in a duplication of damages. All references to dollars or
&#147;$&#148; shall refer to U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. </FONT></P>
