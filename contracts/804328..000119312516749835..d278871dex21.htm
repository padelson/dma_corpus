 _THE OFFER_

Section 2.01 _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that nothing shall have occurred that would give rise to a right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 8, Buyer shall commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the 1934 Act) the Offer as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no
event later than the fifteenth (15th) Business Day following the date of this
Agreement. The obligations of Buyer to accept for payment, and pay for, any
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to the satisfaction or
waiver (to the extent permitted under this Agreement) of the conditions set
forth in Annex I (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The date on which Buyer
commences the Offer is referred to as the " _Offer Commencement Date_ ".

 

(b) In accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject
to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent such waiver is not prohibited by
applicable Law) of the Offer Conditions, Buyer shall, at or as promptly as
practicable following the Expiration Time (but in any event within two (2)
Business Days thereafter), accept for payment (the time of acceptance for
payment, the " _Acceptance Time_ ") and, at or as promptly as practicable
following the Acceptance Time (but in any event within three (3) Business Days
(calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the 1934 Act)
thereafter), pay (by delivery of funds to the depositary for the Offer) for
all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
as of the Acceptance Time (the " _Closing_ ,"); _provided_ , _however_ , that
if, but for this proviso, the Closing would have occurred on a Specified
Quarter End Date, then, if elected by Buyer, the Closing shall take place on
the first Business Day following the latest Specified Quarter End Date for a
particular fiscal quarter, or on such other date to be specified by the
Parties; _provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer shall confirm in writing to the
Company, at the time of such election, that all Offer Conditions were
satisfied on the date the Closing would have occurred but for the immediately
preceding proviso and that all such Offer Conditions (other than any Offer
Condition the waiver of which would be prohibited by Law and except where the
Companys Willful Breach after delivery of such notice proximately caused the
failure of such Offer Condition to be satisfied) shall be deemed to be
satisfied as of such first Business Day. The date on which the Closing occurs
is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". The Offer
Consideration payable in respect of each Share pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be paid, net of any applicable Tax withholding with respect to
the Offer Consideration pursuant to Section 2.09, to the seller in cash,
without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement.

(c) Buyer expressly reserves the right at any time to, in its
sole discretion, waive, in whole or in part, any of the Offer Conditions and
to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer; _provided_
that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Buyer shall not:

 

(i) waive or change the Minimum Condition (except to the extent permitted
under paragraph (A) of Annex I);

 



18 (ii) decrease the Offer Consideration;

 

(iii) change the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer;

 

(iv) decrease the number of Shares sought in the Offer;

 

(v) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Time, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement; or

 

(vi) impose additional Offer Conditions or otherwise amend, modify or
supplement any of the Offer Conditions or terms of the Offer in a manner
adverse to the holders of Shares.

(d) The Offer shall initially expire at 9:00 a.m. (New York City time), or at
such other time as the Parties may mutually agree, on the date that is the
later of (i) twenty-one (21) Business Days (calculated in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the 1934 Act) following the commencement of the Offer and
(ii) such date that is six (6) Business Days after the date of the EGM (such
initial expiration date and time of the Offer, the " _Initial Expiration Time_
") or, if the Offer has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with
Section 2.01(e), the date and time to which the Offer has been so extended
(the Initial Expiration Time, or such later expiration date and time to which
the Offer has been so extended, the " _Expiration Time_ ").

 

(e) Subject to Article 8, Buyer may or shall, as applicable, extend the Offer
from time to time as follows:

 

(i) for the minimum period as required by any rule, regulation, interpretation
or position of the SEC, the staff thereof or the NASDAQ Global Select Market
(the " _NASDAQ_ ") applicable to the Offer; or

(ii) if, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time, any of the Offer Conditions
has not either been (A) satisfied or (B) waived by Buyer (to the extent such
waiver is not prohibited under this Agreement and applicable Law), then Buyer
shall extend the Offer on one or more occasions in consecutive periods of up
to ten (10) Business Days each (with each such period to end at 5:00 p.m. (New
York City time) on the last Business Day of such period) (or such other
duration as may be agreed to by Buyer and the Company) in order to permit the
satisfaction of such Offer Condition(s); _provided_ , _however_ , that if
Buyer determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that at any then-scheduled Expiration Time occurring during the
first one hundred eighty (180) days following the date hereof, the Offer
Condition set forth in paragraph (B) of Annex I is not reasonably likely to be
satisfied within such ten (10) Business Day extension period, then Buyer shall
be permitted to extend the Offer on such occasion for up to twenty (20)
Business Days; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that (x) Buyer shall not be
required to extend the Offer to a date later than the End Date (as the End
Date may be extended pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i)) and (y) if the sole
then-unsatisfied Offer Condition is the Minimum Condition, Buyer shall not be
required to extend the Offer on more than two (2) occasions in consecutive 

 



19  periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each (with each such period to end
at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the last Business Day of such period) (or
such other duration as may be agreed to by Buyer and the Company).

(f) Following the Acceptance Time, Buyer shall (and the Offer Documents shall
so indicate) provide a subsequent offering period (" _Subsequent Offering
Period_ ") in accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the 1934 Act of
not less than ten (10) Business Days (calculated in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the 1934 Act). In the event that prior to the
expiration of the Subsequent Offering Period, Buyer has elected to effectuate
the Asset Sale, Buyer shall (and the Offer Documents shall so indicate) extend
the Subsequent Offering Period for at least five (5) Business Days to permit
any remaining Minority Shareholders to tender their Shares in exchange for the
Offer Consideration (such extension, the " _Minority Exit Offering Period_ ").

 

(g) The Offer may not be terminated prior to the Initial Expiration Time or
the then-scheduled Expiration Time (as the same may be extended pursuant to
Section 2.01(e)) unless this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 8.01. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section
8.01, Buyer shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
following such valid termination) terminate the Offer and not acquire any
Shares pursuant thereto. If the Offer is terminated in accordance with this
Agreement by Buyer prior to the acceptance for payment and payment for Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer, Buyer shall promptly return, and shall cause
any depositary acting on behalf of Buyer to return, in accordance with
applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof. Nothing
in this Section 2.01(g) shall affect any termination rights under Article 8\.

(h) As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, Buyer shall (i)
file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "), which shall contain or incorporate
by reference an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and
other appropriate ancillary offer documents required to be included therein
(such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the
Offer will be made, together with any amendments or supplements thereto and
including exhibits thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the
Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares to the extent required
by applicable United States federal securities Laws and any other applicable
Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to Buyer all information concerning
the Company required by the 1934 Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents.
Each of Buyer and the Company agrees promptly to correct any information
provided by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule TO
and the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become (or shall have become known to be) false or misleading in any
material respect. Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents
as so corrected to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the
extent required by applicable United States federal securities Laws and any
other applicable Law. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents
each time before any such document is filed with the SEC, and Buyer shall
include in such document (and any amendments thereto) all comments reasonably
proposed by the Company and its counsel. Buyer shall provide the Company and
its counsel with (A) any 

 



20  comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that Buyer or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff or other
Governmental Authorities with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications and
(B) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of Buyer to those
comments and to provide comments on that response (which response shall
include all comments reasonably proposed by the Company and its counsel),
including by participating with Buyer or its counsel in any discussions or
meetings with the SEC or other Governmental Authorities to the extent such
participation is not prohibited by the SEC or other Governmental Authorities.

Section 2.02 _Company Action_.

 

(a) The Company hereby approves and consents to the Offer and the other
Signing Transactions. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within
five (5) Business Days prior to the Offer Commencement Date) furnish Buyer
with (i) a list of its shareholders and mailing labels containing the names
and addresses of its record holders of Shares, (ii) any available listing
and computer file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of
Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories
and (iii) copies of all lists of shareholders, security position listings and
computer files in the Companys possession or control regarding the
beneficial owners of Shares, in each case, true and correct as of the most
recent practicable date, and shall provide to Buyer such additional
information (including updated lists of shareholders, mailing labels and
lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as Buyer may
reasonably request in connection with the Offer. In the event that the Company
is prohibited from providing such information, (A) it shall request
permission from the applicable shareholders to provide such information to
Buyer or (B) if the information requested is not received at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall deliver
to such shareholders all information that would otherwise be required to be
provided by Buyer to such shareholders of the Company in connection with the
Offer, and, notwithstanding this Article 2, Buyer shall not have any
obligation to deliver such information to such shareholders under this
Agreement. Except as required by applicable Law, and except for such steps as
are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Offer, (i) Buyer and its Affiliates and
Representatives shall hold in confidence the information contained in such
labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with
the Transactions, and (ii) if this Agreement is terminated, Buyer
shall deliver to the Company and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its Affiliates and Representatives to deliver to the Company all copies
and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their possession.

 

(b) On the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall, concurrently with the
filing of the Schedule TO, file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable United States
federal securities Laws and any other applicable Law, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") that, subject to Section 5.03(d), shall reflect the
Company Recommendation. Buyer shall promptly furnish to the Company all
information concerning Buyer or any of its applicable Affiliates required by
the 1934 Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company and
Buyer agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for inclusion
or 

 



21  incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that
it shall have become (or shall have become known to be) false or misleading in
any material respect. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the extent required by
applicable United States federal securities Laws and any other applicable
Law. Buyer and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 each time before it is filed with the SEC,
and the Company shall include in such document (and any amendments thereto)
all comments reasonably proposed by Buyer and its counsel. The Company shall
provide Buyer and its counsel with (i) any comments or other communications,
whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time
to time from the SEC or its staff or other Governmental Authorities with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments or
other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
Companys response to those comments and to provide comments on that response
(which response shall include all comments reasonably proposed by Buyer and
its counsel), including by participating with the Company or its counsel in
any discussions or meetings with the SEC or other Governmental Authorities to
the extent such participation is not prohibited by the SEC or other
Governmental Authorities.

Section 2.03 _Outstanding Equity Awards_.

(a) _Vested Company RSUs and Company PSUs_. At the Closing, each Company RSU
and Company PSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing
and either (i) vested in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company
Equity Plan and award agreement evidencing such Company RSU or Company PSU, as
applicable, as of immediately prior to the Closing or (ii) subject to
accelerated vesting solely as a result of the completion of the Transactions
in accordance with the terms thereof, will, without any action on the part of
Parent, Buyer, the Company, the holder thereof, or any other Person, be
canceled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
Offer Consideration by (y) the total number of Shares subject to such Company
RSU or Company PSU.

(b) _Unvested Company RSUs_. At the Closing, each Company RSU that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing and not covered by Section
2.03(a) will, without any action on the part of Parent, Buyer, the Company,
the holder thereof, or any other Person, be converted into an equity award
subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such Company RSU
(including the same vesting schedule and terms regarding acceleration and
forfeiture upon termination of employment or service) immediately prior to the
Closing with respect to a number of shares of common stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) of Parent equal to (i) the number of Shares subject
to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Closing, multiplied by (ii) the
Equity Award Adjustment Ratio. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Equity
Award Adjustment Ratio_ " shall mean (x) the Offer Consideration divided by
(y) the average closing price of the common stock of Parent on NASDAQ for the
twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately
preceding the date of the Closing, rounded to the nearest one ten thousandth.
With respect to any fractional share that was rounded down in respect of any
Company RSU, the holder shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the Offer
Consideration by (y) such fractional share.

 



22 (c) _Unvested Company PSUs_. At the Closing, each Company PSU that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing and not covered by Section
2.03(a), will, without any action on the part of Parent, Buyer, the Company,
the holder thereof, or any other Person, be converted into an equity award
with respect to a number of shares of common stock (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) of Parent equal to (x) the number of Shares subject to
such Company PSU immediately prior to the Closing, multiplied by (y) the
Equity Award Adjustment Ratio. Each such converted award will thereafter be
subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the related
Company PSU immediately prior to the Closing, except that as of the Closing
the performance metrics shall no longer apply and the award shall be subject
solely to service-based vesting on the applicable dates on which it would
have vested in accordance with the terms thereof in effect prior to the
Closing had the applicable performance criteria (including any "catch-up"
performance criteria) been fully achieved, subject to acceleration and
forfeiture upon termination of employment or service in accordance with the
applicable terms of the award. With respect to any fractional share that was
rounded down in respect of any Company PSU, the holder shall be entitled to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the Offer Consideration by (y) such fractional share.

 

(d) _Vested Company Options_. At the Closing, each Company Option that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing and either (i) vested in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Equity Plan and award
agreement evidencing such Company Option as of immediately prior to the
Closing or (ii) subject to accelerated vesting solely as a result of
the completion of the Transactions in accordance with the terms thereof,
will, without any action on the part of Parent, Buyer, the Company, the holder
thereof, or any other Person, be canceled and converted into and will become a
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(x) the excess, if any, of the Offer Consideration over the applicable per
Share exercise price of such Company Option multiplied by (y) the number of
Shares subject to such Company Option. Following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents of
any holders of any Company Option described in clause (i) or (ii) of the
preceding sentence necessary to effectuate the treatment of such Company
Options as described in this Section 2.03(d).

(e) _Unvested Company Options_. At the Closing, each Company Option that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing and is not covered by
Section 2.03(d), will, without any action on the part of Parent, Buyer, the
Company, the holder thereof, or any other Person, be converted into an
option to purchase, subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to
such Company Option (including the same vesting schedule and terms regarding
acceleration and forfeiture upon termination of employment or service)
immediately prior to the Closing, a number of shares of common stock (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) of Parent equal to (w) the number of Shares
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Closing, multiplied by
(x) the Equity Award Adjustment Ratio, with an exercise price per share
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (y) the exercise price per
Share for which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Closing, divided by (z) the Equity Award Adjustment Ratio. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, to the extent applicable, the exercise price
and the number of shares of Parent common stock purchasable pursuant to the
Company Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with
the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case of any Company
Option to which

 



23  Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of shares
of Parent common stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined
subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.

(f) The payments in respect of Company Equity Awards described in this
Section 2.03 will be subject to Section 2.09. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, (i) with respect to any Company Equity Award that constitutes
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, to
the extent that payment of the amounts described in this Section 2.03 would
otherwise cause the imposition of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the
Code, such payment shall instead be made at the earliest time permitted under
the Company Equity Plan and applicable award agreement that will not result
in the imposition of such Tax or penalty and (ii) with respect to Company
Equity Awards held by individuals subject to Taxes imposed by the Laws of a
country other than the United States, the Parties shall cooperate in good
faith prior to the Closing with the goal of minimizing the Tax impact of the
provisions set forth in this Section 2.03.

 

(g) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing (but no later than the
second payroll date after the Closing), the applicable holders of vested
Company Equity Awards will receive the payments described in Section 2.03(a)
and Section 2.03(d) from the Company or its applicable Subsidiary or Affiliate
(which amounts Buyer shall deposit or cause to be deposited, to the extent
that the Companys (or its applicable Subsidiarys or Affiliates) cash as of
the Closing is insufficient to fund the payment of such amounts, with the
Company or its applicable Subsidiary or Affiliate, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, at or promptly following the Closing), through
its payroll system or payroll provider, of all amounts required to be paid to
such holders in respect of such vested Company Equity Awards that are canceled
and converted pursuant to Section 2.03(a) or Section 2.03(d). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any such payment owed to a holder of such a vested Company
Equity Award cannot be made through the Companys (or its applicable
Subsidiarys or Affiliates) payroll system or payroll provider, then the
Company (or its applicable Subsidiary or Affiliate) will issue a check for
such payment to such holder promptly following the Closing Date.

 

(h) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the Closing, the Company, the Company Board and the
Nominating and Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the "
_Compensation Committee_ "), as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
amendments as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 2.03. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to provide that the Company will not be required to deliver Shares
or other shares in the share capital of the Company to any Person pursuant to
or in settlement of Company Equity Awards after the Closing; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company shall only be required to use
commercially reasonably efforts to obtain any applicable consents or
acknowledgements from the holders of any Company Equity Awards that may be
necessary to effectuate the provisions of this sentence and (ii) in no event
shall the Companys failure to obtain any such consents or acknowledgements
after using such commercially reasonable efforts be deemed to be a breach of
this Agreement.

(i) At the Closing, Buyer shall (or shall cause one of its Affiliates to)
assume the Company Equity Plan and all obligations of the Company under the
Company Equity

 



24  Plan. The agreements evidencing any Company Equity Award that is converted
pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.03). Buyer
shall (or shall cause one of its Affiliates to) take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent
common stock for delivery upon exercise or settlement of such assumed awards.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, to the extent necessary,
Buyer shall (or shall cause one of its Affiliates to) file a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form)
with respect to the shares of Parent common stock underlying such assumed
awards and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such assumed awards remain outstanding.

Section 2.04 _Extraordinary General Meeting_.

(a) No later than ten (10) weeks following the Offer Commencement Date, the
Company shall hold an extraordinary general meeting (the " _EGM_ ") to:

(i) provide information regarding the Offer;

 

(ii) adopt a resolution to, subject to (A) the Acceptance Time having occurred
and (B) the number of Shares validly tendered in accordance with the terms of
the Offer (including Shares tendered during the Subsequent Offering Period, as
it may be extended by the Minority Exit Offering Period) and not properly
withdrawn, together with the Shares owned by Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
representing at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding Shares (the "
_Asset Sale Threshold_ "), approve the asset sale as contemplated by the Asset
Sale Documentation (the " _Asset Sale_ ") as required under section 2:107a of
the DCC;

(iii) adopt a resolution to, subject to (A) the Acceptance Time having
occurred, (B) the Asset Sale Threshold having been achieved but the
Compulsory Acquisition Threshold not having been achieved and (C) the Asset
Sale having been completed, (1) dissolve ( _ontbinden_ ) the Company in
accordance with section 2:19 of the DCC and (2) appoint as liquidator
Stichting Vereffening NXP, a foundation ( _stichting_ ) to be incorporated
under Dutch Law and approve reimbursement of the liquidators reasonable
salary and costs (provided that such reimbursement will be subject to the
approval of the Independent Directors) and (3) appoint an Affiliate of the
Company as the custodian of the books and records of the Company in accordance
with section 2:24 of the DCC;

 

(iv) adopt one or more resolutions effective upon the Acceptance Time to
provide full and final discharge to each member of the Company Board for
their acts of management or supervision, as applicable, up to the date of the
EGM; _provided_ that no discharge will be given to any director for acts as a
result of fraud ( _bedrog_ ), gross negligence ( _grove schuld_ ), or willful
misconduct ( _opzet_ ) of such director;

 



25 (v) adopt one or more resolutions effective upon the Closing to appoint
the Buyer Directors to replace the resigning members of the Company Board
(the " _Governance Resolutions_ ");

 

(vi) adopt a resolution to, subject to Closing and effective the day
immediately following the Closing Date, amend the articles of association of
the Company to align the financial year of the Company with the financial year
reckoned by Buyer; and

 

(vii) adopt a resolution to, subject to the Shares having been delisted from
the NASDAQ, (A) convert the Company from a public limited liability company (
_naamloze vennootschap_ ) to a private company with limited liability (
_besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid_ ) and (B) amend the
Companys articles of association in connection with the matters described in
clause (A).

(b) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare
appropriate materials for the EGM (together with any amendments and
supplements thereto and any other documents required, the " _EGM Materials_ ")
relating to the matters set forth in Section 2.04(a). Subject to Section
5.03(d), the Company shall include the Company Recommendation in the EGM
Materials. Buyer shall promptly furnish to the Company all information
concerning Buyer and any of its Affiliates required to be set forth in the EGM
Materials. The Company shall provide Buyer and its counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the EGM Materials (and any amendments
thereto) each time prior to dissemination to the shareholders of the Company
and the Company shall include in the EGM Materials all comments reasonably
proposed by Buyer and its counsel. The Company shall provide Buyer and its
counsel, to the extent not prohibited under applicable Law, with (i) any
comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that the Company or
its counsel may receive from time to time from Governmental Authorities with
respect to the EGM Materials promptly after receipt of those comments or other
communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
Companys response to those comments and to provide comments on that response
(which response shall include all comments reasonably proposed by Buyer and
its counsel), including by participating with the Company or its counsel in
any discussions or meetings with Governmental Authorities to the extent such
participation is not prohibited by the applicable Governmental Authority.

(c) The Company shall consult with Buyer regarding the date of the EGM (or
any Subsequent EGM) and, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Section 8.01, shall not cancel the EGM (or any Subsequent EGM) without
the prior written consent of Buyer;  _provided_ that the Company may, on no
more than one (1) occasion, following reasonable consultation with Buyer, and,
to the extent requested in writing by Buyer, the Company shall cancel and
reconvene the EGM solely to the extent reasonably necessary (x) to ensure
that any supplement or amendment to EGM Materials that the Company Board,
after consultation with outside counsel, reasonably determines is necessary to
comply with applicable Law is made available to the Companys shareholders in
advance of the EGM (and any Subsequent EGM) or (y) to solicit additional
proxies in favor of the approvals set forth in Section 2.04(a). In the event
the EGM is cancelled and reconvened pursuant to the foregoing proviso, 

 



26  the Company shall duly give notice of and reconvene the EGM on a date
scheduled by mutual agreement of the Company and Buyer, acting reasonably, or,
in the absence of such agreement, as soon as practicable following the date
of such cancellation but, in any event, no later than the day that is thirty-
five (35) days following the date of such cancellation (or, in the case of a
Subsequent EGM, a date that shall be prior to the date of the Expiration
Time).

(d) The Company shall ensure that the EGM (and any Subsequent EGM) is called,
noticed, convened, held and conducted in compliance in all material respects
with all applicable Law. The adoption of the matters set forth in Section
2.04(a) shall be the only matters that the Company shall propose to be acted
on by the shareholders of the Company at the EGM (and any Subsequent EGM),
unless otherwise reasonably proposed by the Company and approved in advance in
writing by Buyer (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent
that, at the EGM, the Asset Sale Resolutions and/or the Governance
Resolutions have not been adopted, the Company shall, following consultation
with the Buyer, duly call and give notice of another EGM (the " _Subsequent
EGM_ "), which shall take place at a date reasonably acceptable to Buyer and
not later than a date that shall be prior to the date of the Expiration Time.

(f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to the
Companys rights to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01,
the Company agrees that (i) its obligation to duly call, give notice of,

27 (b) Each Independent Director shall resign from, and the Company shall take
such other action necessary to ensure that each such Independent Director
ceases to be a director of, the Company Board upon the earliest of (i) such
time after the Acceptance Time as Buyer owns one hundred percent (100%) of the
issued and outstanding Shares, (ii) the Second Step Distribution being paid
in full and (iii) completion of the liquidation of the Company.

the discharge of any director for acts as a result of fraud ( _bedrog_ ),
gross negligence ( _grove schuld_ ), or willful misconduct ( _opzet_ ) of such
director.

 

(f) Notwithstanding any other required vote, the affirmative vote of the
Independent Directors will also be required for approving:

of the shareholdings of the Minority Shareholders, other than (A) pursuant to

Shareholders have been offered an opportunity to subscribe pro rata in
accordance with their then existing shareholding in the Company (
_voorkeursrecht_ ), (B) the Asset Sale and Second Step Distribution or (C) the
Compulsory Acquisition; and

(ii) any other form of unequal treatment that prejudices or could reasonably

reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to
afford Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access on reasonable advance
notice and in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the operations of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during normal business hours

 



63  to the officers, senior employees, Representatives, auditors, properties,
offices and other facilities and the books and records of the Company and the
Subsidiaries of the Company, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Buyer copies (including in
electronic form) of books, records and other financial, operating and other
data and information as Buyer may reasonably request in writing;  _provided_
, _however_ , that such access shall not permit Buyer and its Representatives
to conduct any invasive environmental testing or sampling at any of the
properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not be obligated to disclose any information (i) if providing such
access or disclosing such information would cause significant competitive harm
to the Company or its Subsidiaries if the Transactions are not consummated,
(ii) if providing such access or disclosing such information would violate any
applicable Law (including antitrust and privacy Laws) or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, or (iii) that, would, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company on advice of outside counsel, result in
the loss of attorney-client privilege with respect to such information or
would constitute a waiver of any other privilege or trade secret protection
held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts (A) to allow for such access or
disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-
client privilege or waiver of any other privilege or trade secret protection
or (B) to develop an alternative to providing such information so as to
address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the Company.
The Company shall advise Buyer in such circumstances that it is unable to
comply with Buyers reasonable requests for information pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, and the Company shall reasonably describe the
reasons why such information is being withheld. The Company shall be entitled
to have Representatives present at all times during any inspection by Buyer
pursuant to this Section 5.02(a). No notice, access, review or investigation
pursuant to this Section 5.02 or information provided, made available or
delivered to Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.02 or otherwise shall affect any
representations or warranties of the Company or conditions or rights of Buyer
contained in this Agreement. No investigation after the date of this
Agreement shall affect or be deemed to modify or supplement any representation
or warranty made by the Company herein.

(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement will be
subject to the provisions of the confidentiality agreement dated as of July 4,
2016, by and between River BV and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed
terminated as of the Closing.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Buyer, directly or
indirectly, rights to control the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before

respective directors and officers not to, and the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their respective Representatives not to, and shall not publicly announce any
intention to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly facilitate, knowingly induce or encourage (including by providing
information, cooperation or assistance) any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes or

 



64  would reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) other than informing Persons of the provisions contained in this Section
5.03, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Alternative Acquisition Proposal or (iii) execute
or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract (whether or not
binding) with respect to an Alternative Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors and officers to, and shall direct each of the
Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations with
any Person conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any
Alternative Acquisition Proposal, and shall not modify, amend or terminate, or
waive, release or assign, any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill
agreement (or any similar agreement) to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party relating to any such Alternative Acquisition Proposal
and shall enforce the provisions of any such agreement; _provided_ that the
Company shall be permitted to release or waive the standstill obligations
solely to the extent necessary to permit the party referenced therein to
submit an Alternative Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board on a
confidential basis conditioned upon such Person agreeing that the Company
shall not be prohibited from providing any information to Buyer regarding any
such Alternative Acquisition Proposal in accordance with the terms of this
Section 5.03. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days of the date of this Agreement) request each Person that has
prior to the date of this Agreement executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of any Alternative Acquisition Proposal to,
in accordance with the terms of such agreement, return or destroy all
confidential information furnished prior to the execution of this Agreement to
or for the benefit of such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Company agrees that it shall promptly inform
its Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.03.

the event that the Company receives during the Pre-Closing Period, an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Alternative Acquisition Proposal, the Company

failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under the
Laws of The Netherlands and (B) (i) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that such Alternative Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) the submission
of such Alternative Acquisition Proposal did not result from or arise in
connection with a breach of this Section 5.03):

(i) furnish nonpublic information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person or group making such Alternative Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ that (A) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic
information, it receives from such Person or group an executed confidentiality
agreement containing confidentiality terms at least as restrictive as the
terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and which shall not contain
any exclusivity provision or other term that would restrict, in any manner,
the Companys ability to consummate the Transactions or to comply with its

 



65  disclosure obligations to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement (an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (B) prior to or contemporaneously with
furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person or group, it
furnishes such nonpublic information to Buyer to the extent Buyer has not
previously been provided with such information; and

 

(ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group with
respect to such Alternative Acquisition Proposal. 

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections
5.03(a), (b), and (d), as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt of any Alternative Acquisition Proposal
or any request for nonpublic information or any inquiry that would reasonably
be expected to lead to any Alternative Acquisition Proposal, the Company
shall provide Buyer with written notice of the material terms and conditions
of such Alternative Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity
of the Person or group making any such Alternative Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry, if not previously provided pursuant to Section 5.03(b).

until such Alternative Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry is withdrawn,
(i) the Company (or its outside legal counsel) shall keep Buyer (or its
outside counsel) informed on a reasonably current basis regarding the status
and terms (other than immaterial terms) of discussions and negotiations
relating to any such Alternative Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry at
the request of Buyer and (ii) the Company shall, as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours following the receipt or
delivery thereof), provide Buyer (or its outside legal counsel) with
unredacted copies of all written proposals or proposed transaction agreements
(including all schedules and exhibits thereto) relating to any such
Alternative Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) Except as provided in Section 5.03(e), neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (i) (A) withhold, withdraw,
qualify, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify,
amend or modify, the Company Recommendation or fail to make, or include in the
applicable Company Disclosure Documents, the approval,
adoption, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board
or any committee thereof of this Agreement, of the Offer or any of the other
Transactions, or make any public statement inconsistent with the Company
Recommendation or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt or approve, any Alternative Acquisition Proposal, or (C)
publicly make any recommendation in connection with an Alternative Acquisition
Proposal other than a recommendation against such proposal (any action
described in this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar Contract (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (A) relating to any Alternative
Acquisition Proposal or any offer or proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Alternative Acquisition Proposal or (B) requiring it
(or that would require it) to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Transactions (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 



66 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 5.03(d),
solely in response to a Superior Proposal received by the Company Board after
the date of this Agreement, the Company Board may, at any time prior to the
Expiration Time, make an Adverse Recommendation Change or validly terminate
this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 8.01(d)(i), or
authorize, resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any such action, only if
all of the following conditions are met:

 

(i) the Company has not breached any of its obligations under this Section
5.03 (where such breach proximately caused such Superior Proposal being
received by the Company);

(ii) the Company shall have (A) provided to Buyer four (4) Business Days
prior written notice, which shall state expressly (1) that it has received a
Superior Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and the identity of the
Person or group making the Superior Proposal), and shall have
contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement and all other documents (other than immaterial documents) related to
the Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term or condition of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new notice and a new three (3) Business Day period)
and (3) that, subject to clause (iii) below, the Company Board has determined
to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.01(d)(i) in order to enter into the Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, as applicable, and (B) prior to making such an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement in accordance with Section
8.01(d)(i), as applicable, to the extent requested by Buyer, engaged in good
faith negotiations with Buyer during such four (4) Business Day period to
amend this Agreement in such a manner that the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and

(iii) the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that, in
light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised terms
proposed by Buyer, such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change or to
so terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(d)(i), as
applicable, would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
the Laws of The Netherlands.

 



67 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 5.03(d),
upon the occurrence of any Intervening Event, the Company Board may, at any
time prior to the Expiration Time, make an Adverse Recommendation Change, or
authorize, resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any such action, only if
all of the following conditions are met:

(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Buyer four (4) Business Days prior
written notice, which shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail information
describing the Intervening Event and the rationale for the Adverse
Recommendation Change and (2) state expressly that, subject to clause (ii)
below, the Company Board has determined to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change and (B) prior to making such an Adverse Recommendation Change, to the
extent requested by Buyer, engaged in good faith negotiations with Buyer
during such four (4) Business Day period to amend this Agreement in such a
manner that the failure of the Company Board to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to the Intervening Event in accordance with
clause (ii) below would no longer be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under the Laws of The Netherlands; and

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that in light of such
Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed by Buyer,
the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under the Laws of The Netherlands.

(g) Unless this Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to Article 8,
neither the Company nor the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall

position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
1934 Act (or any similar communication to shareholders in connection with
the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer); _provided_ that
any such disclosure shall be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change unless
the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Recommendation.

 

Section 5.04 _Compensation Arrangements_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
will take all steps that may be required, necessary or advisable to cause
each Company Plan or similar arrangement that has been or, after the date of
this Agreement, will be entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with any of its directors, officers or employees pursuant to

as referred to in article 12b of the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act ( _Wet op
de vennootschapsbelasting 1969_ ) (the " _Innovation Box_ "), to any material
Dutch Tax ruling or settlement agreement relating to Dutch Tax (the " _Dutch

consider any such actions with respect to the Innovation Box and the Dutch

conference calls or meetings between the Head of Tax for the Company and
Representatives of Buyer to discuss material developments in relation to the
Innovation Box and the Dutch Tax Rulings, (d) provide Buyer an opportunity to

timely proposed by Buyer and its counsel and (e) not initiate or enter into
any discussions with the Taxing Authority relating to the Innovation Box or
the Dutch Tax Rulings without providing the Senior Vice President, Tax or Vice
President, Tax of Parent, or such other individuals as designated by Buyer,

the contrary in this Section 5.05, the terms and conditions set forth on

with respect to any Dutch Tax Rulings contemplated therein. Prior to making a
Second Step Distribution, if any, Buyer and the Company agree that the
Company will seek an advance Tax clearance on the amount of equity ( _gestort
kapitaal_ ) for Dutch dividend withholding Tax purposes pursuant to article 13

Subject to Section 5.01(r), during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, file any Dutch Tax Returns or take
positions in relation to Dutch Tax in other filings, in a manner and on a
basis consistent with past practice, except as required by applicable Law.

69 Section 5.07 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the Compensation Committee shall (and shall be permitted
to) take such steps as may be reasonably required or advisable to cause
dispositions of Company Securities (including derivative securities) pursuant
to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer of the
Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act.

Section 5.08 _Anti-Takeover Measures_. The Company and the Company Board (and
any applicable committees thereof) shall take all actions within their power
and authority necessary so that no Anti-Takeover Measure is or becomes

any applicable committees thereof) shall grant such approvals and take such
actions within their power and authority as are necessary so that any such
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act within their power and
authority to eliminate such Anti-Takeover Measures on such Transactions.

Section 5.09 _Social and Economic Council Merger Regulation_. Promptly after
the date of this Agreement, the Company shall, also acting on behalf of
Buyer, notify the Social and Economic Council and the Dutch trade unions of
the Offer in accordance with the provisions of the Social and Economic Council
Merger Regulation for the protection of employees ( _SER-Besluit
Fusiegedragsregels 2015_ ), if and to the extent applicable.

Section 5.10 _Change of Financial Year of the Company s Dutch Subsidiaries_.

ARTICLE 6

_COVENANTS OF BUYER_

Buyer agrees that:

 

Section 6.01 _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

(a) For six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer shall cause (and Buyer shall
cause Parent to cause) the Company and its Subsidiaries to indemnify and hold
harmless the present and former directors or officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing and in connection with the
Asset Sale and the Second Step Distribution, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law or to the extent provided under the Company Organizational
Documents. In the event that any Indemnified Person is made party to any
Action arising out of or relating to matters that would be indemnifiable
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer and the Company shall
advance fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements) as incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with and
prior to the final disposition of such Action, subject to the execution by
such Indemnified Person of appropriate

 



70  undertakings to repay such advanced fees, costs and expenses if it is
ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to
indemnification, in each case except to the extent prohibited under
applicable Law. For a period of six (6) years following the Closing, Buyer
shall cause (and Buyer shall cause Parent to cause) the Company and its
Subsidiaries to honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements in
effect immediately prior to the Closing between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Person (the " _Indemnification Agreements_
"). In addition, for a period of six (6) years following the Closing, Buyer
shall cause (and Buyer shall cause Parent to cause) the Company and its
Subsidiaries to cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other
similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to exculpation of Liability of all Indemnified
Persons, indemnification of all Indemnified Persons and advancement of fees,
costs and expenses that are no less advantageous in the aggregate to the
intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in the
Company Organizational Documents. To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law, such indemnification and exculpation shall be mandatory
rather than permissive.

(b) Buyer shall obtain, or cause to be obtained, as of the Closing, a "tail"
insurance policy with a claims period of six (6) years after the Closing with
respect to directors and officers Liability insurance covering each Person
currently covered by the Companys directors and officers Liability
insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing
on terms that are no less favorable than those of such policy of the Company
in effect on the date of this Agreement, which insurance shall, prior to the
Closing, be in effect and prepaid for such six (6)-year period; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, in no event shall the total cost for such prepaid "tail"
insurance policy exceed 300% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof
by the Company for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if the total
cost for such prepaid "tail" policy exceeds the Premium Cap, then Buyer may
obtain a prepaid "tail" policy with the maximum coverage available for a total
cost of the Premium Cap. If Buyer for any reason fails to obtain such "tail"
insurance policy as of the Closing, Buyer shall continue to maintain in
effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Closing, the
directors and officers Liability insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
directors and officers Liability insurance carrier.

(c) If Buyer, the Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
shall consolidate with, or merge with or into, any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties or
assets to any Person, then, in each case, Buyer shall take such action as may
be necessary so that such Person shall assume all of the applicable
obligations set forth in this Section 6.01.

 

(d) Each of the Indemnified Persons are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.01 with full rights of enforcement as if
a party hereto. The rights of any Indemnified Person under this Section 6.01
shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that
such Persons may have under the Company Organizational Documents, the
Indemnification Agreements or applicable Law (whether at Law or in equity).

 



71 Section 6.02 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing (or, such shorter period of employment, as the
case may be), each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who remains
employed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ")
shall receive from Buyer (or its applicable Affiliate)
compensation (including, base salary and annual bonus opportunity) that is
substantially comparable in the aggregate to what such Continuing Employee was
entitled to immediately prior to the Closing Date and benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to either those benefits that are
generally made available as of the date of this Agreement by the Company to
such employees or by Buyer to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its
Affiliates, as determined by Buyer in its sole discretion. This Section
6.02(a) shall not apply to Continuing Employees whose terms and conditions of
employment are governed by a collective bargaining, works council, or similar
agreement. Buyer will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to honor the
terms of any written collective bargaining or similar agreements to which the
Company or its Subsidiaries is bound.

(b) Any Continuing Employee who incurs a termination of employment during the
period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of
the Closing Date shall be entitled to receive the severance payments and
benefits that such Continuing Employee would have been entitled to receive
from the Company and its Affiliates under its applicable written severance
plans and policies as in effect immediately prior to the Closing and that have
been made available to Buyer in accordance with Section 3.18(b) of this
Agreement.

(c) As of the Closing and solely with respect to Continuing Employees, should
Buyer elect to transition a Continuing Employee from a Company Plan to a
welfare plan of Buyer or one of its Affiliates, Buyer shall, and shall cause
any applicable Affiliate to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
any of their applicable respective Third Party insurance providers to, use
reasonable best efforts to waive all limitations as to any pre-existing
condition or waiting periods in its applicable welfare plans with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Continuing
Employee under any welfare plans that such Continuing Employee may be eligible
to participate in after the Closing and to credit each Continuing Employee for
any copayments, deductibles, offsets or similar payments made under a
Company Plan during the plan year that includes the Closing for purposes of
satisfying any applicable copayment, deductible, offset or similar
requirements under the comparable plans of Buyer or any of its Affiliates. As
of the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause any applicable Affiliate to,
credit to Continuing Employees the amount of vacation time that such employees
had accrued under any applicable Company Plan as of the Closing, in each case,
insofar as not prohibited by applicable Law. In addition, as of the Closing,
Buyer shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliate to give Continuing
Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting, participation in
and solely for vacation plans, determination of level of benefits under any
employee benefit and compensation plans or arrangements (other than with
respect to defined benefit plans, retiree medical plans or frozen benefit
plans) maintained by Buyer or an applicable Affiliate that such
Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing for
such Continuing Employees service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to the same extent that such service was credited for purposes of any
comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Closing, except, in each
case, to the extent such treatment would result in duplicative benefits.

 



72 (d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall take all actions including obtaining any necessary
determinations or resolutions of the Company Board (or a committee thereof),
if appropriate, amending the terms of the Company ESPP that may be necessary
or required under the Company ESPP and applicable Laws to (A) prohibit
participants in the Company ESPP from increasing their payroll deductions from
those in effect on the date of this Agreement (or to make separate non-payroll
contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement,
except as may be required by applicable Law), (B) if the Closing shall occur
prior to the scheduled ending date of an offering period (any such period, the
" _Final Offering_ "), provide each individual participating in the Final
Offering with notice of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement no
later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (C) cause the
Final Offering to end no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing
Date, (D) make any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the
shortened Final Offering, but otherwise treat such shortened Final Offering as
a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes pursuant to
the Company ESPP, (E) cause each Company ESPP participants accumulated
contributions under the Company ESPP to be used to purchase Shares in
accordance with the Company ESPP as of the end of the Final Offering, (F)
provide that the applicable purchase price for Shares shall not be decreased
below the levels set forth in the Company ESPP as of the date of this
Agreement and (G) ensure that no further rights are granted or exercised under
the Company ESPP after the Acceptance Time. Immediately prior to
and effective as of the Closing (but subject to the consummation of the
Transactions), the Company will terminate the Company ESPP.

(e) If requested by Buyer in writing within ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing, effective as of, and contingent upon, the Closing, the Company
shall adopt such resolutions and/or amendments to terminate each Company Plan
listed on Section 6.02(e) of the Company Letter (each, a " _Terminated Plan_
"). The Company shall provide Buyer with a copy of the resolutions and/or plan
amendments (subject to reasonable advance review and comment by Buyer)
evidencing that each Terminated Plan has been terminated.

(f) Each individual who is employed by the Company or any of its Affiliates as
of immediately prior to the Closing and is a participant in a cash bonus
program maintained by the Company or any of its Affiliates for the year in
which the Closing occurs shall be eligible to receive a cash bonus based on
the level of achievement of the applicable performance criteria as of the
Closing as determined by the Compensation Committee prior to the Closing, pro-
rated based on the number of days in the applicable performance period that
have elapsed as of the Closing. Any such bonus shall be paid to the
applicable employee on the same date on which the bonus would have been paid
to the employee had the Closing not occurred (subject to the same employment
or service requirements, and any acceleration of payments based on the terms
of the applicable bonus program as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing).

(g) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that the consummation of the
Transactions shall constitute a change in control or change of control (or
words of similar import), as the case may be, for all purposes under each of
the Company Plans for which such concept is relevant.

 



73 (h) Notwithstanding the generality of Section 9.10, the provisions of this
Section 6.02 are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no current or
former Company Service Provider or any other individual associated therewith
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Section
6.02. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to confer upon
any Company Service Provider any right to continued employment with Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including, following the Acceptance Time, the Company
and its Subsidiaries) or to limit the ability of Buyer, or any of its
Affiliates to terminate the employment of any employee at any time and for any
reason. Nothing herein shall be deemed to establish, amend, modify or cause to
be adopted any Company Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement maintained or sponsored by Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates.

Section 6.03  _Letter Agreement Matters_. Buyer shall (a) take any and all
actions (including enforcing its rights against Parent under the Letter
Agreement) necessary to ensure that Parent performs, satisfies and discharges,
and has the ability to perform, satisfy and discharge, each and every
covenant, term, condition or other obligation (both monetary and non-monetary)
to be performed or complied with by Parent under, and in accordance with the
terms of, the Letter Agreement, (b) not agree, resolve or commit to amend,
modify, terminate or waive (or permit Parent to so agree, resolve or commit to
amend, modify, terminate or waive) any right or remedy under, the Letter
Agreement and (c) not take, or agree, resolve or commit to take (or permit
Parent to so take, agree, resolve or commit to take), any action that could in
any way adversely impact any of Buyers rights (including Buyers ability to
enforce its rights) under the Letter Agreement.

 

Section 6.04 _Letter of Credit Matters_. No later than thirty (30) days from
the date of this Agreement (the " _Delivery Date_ "), Buyer shall cause an
Affiliate of Buyer to deliver to the Company (i) an irrevocable standby letter
of credit from the financial institution named therein (the " _L/C Bank_ "),
for the amount of $$2,000,000,000 in favor of the Company, dated as of the
date thereof (the " _Letter of Credit_ "), pursuant to which the Company shall
have the right, subject only to the Companys ability to draw described below,
to draw in amounts to fund the Buyer Termination Compensation or to satisfy
any damages judgment, decision or award of a Governmental Authority pursuant
to which Buyer is obligated to pay amounts to the Company pursuant to this
Agreement. The Letter of Credit shall provide that the L/C Bank shall fund
all funds under the Letter of Credit to the Company within five (5) Business
Days after L/C Bank receives either (i) written confirmation from both Parent
and the Company that they mutually agree that such funds are payable to
the Company pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) from the Company with a copy
of an order from a Chosen Court finding that such funds are due and payable to
the Company pursuant to this Agreement. Except as set forth in the Letter of
Credit, until the earlier of (x) the Closing and (y) such time as this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms, Buyer shall not,
and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, (a) agree, resolve or commit to
amend, modify, terminate or waive any right or remedy under the Letter of
Credit and (b) take, agree, resolve, commit to take, any action that could in
any way adversely impact any of the Companys rights (including the Companys
ability to enforce its rights) under the Letter of Credit. Buyer shall
arrange that any and all commitment fees or other fees required

 



74  to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Letter of Credit or any financing
facility or reimbursement agreement under which the Letter of Credit will be
issued on or before the Delivery Date, will be paid in full, and will pay in
full any such amounts due on or before the Closing Date. On the Delivery Date,
Buyer shall provide to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of the
Letter of Credit.

Certain Covenants_. The representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement and in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall not survive the Acceptance Time. This Section 9.02 shall not
limit Section 8.02 or any covenant or agreement of the Parties that by its
terms contemplates performance after the Acceptance Time or the termination of
this

 



89  Agreement. The terms of Article 1 and this Article 9, as well as the
covenants and other agreements set forth in this Agreement that by their terms
apply, or that are to be performed in whole or in part, after the Acceptance
Time or termination of this Agreement, shall survive the Acceptance Time or
termination of this Agreement, as applicable, in accordance with their terms.

 

Section 9.03 _Amendments and Waivers_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided for in paragraph (A) of Annex I,
this Agreement may only be amended or supplemented at any time by additional
written agreements signed by, or on behalf of the Parties, as may mutually be
determined by the Parties to be necessary, desirable or expedient to further
the purpose of this Agreement or to clarify the intention of the Parties.

 

(b) No provision of this Agreement may be waived or extended except by a
written instrument signed by the Party against whom the waiver or extension
is to be effective. No failure or delay on the part of any Party in the
exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be
a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty
or agreement in this Agreement, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
right.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.03, no
amendment, supplement, modification, consent or waiver to any of Section
9.06, Section 9.07, Section 9.10, Section 9.12, Section 9.13 and/or this
Section 9.03(c) that is adverse to the Debt Financing Sources shall become
effective without the prior written consent of the adversely affected Debt
Financing Sources. 

Section 9.04 _Rules of Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting this Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

Section 9.05 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ that without the
consent of the Company, (a) Buyer may assign, in its sole discretion, any or
all of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any one
or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries or Affiliates controlled
by Parent and (b) after the Acceptance Time, Buyer may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement to any Person; _provided_ that in
each of clauses (a) and (b), such transfer or assignment shall not (i)
adversely impact in any respect the Company or its shareholders or the rights
of the Company under this Agreement (including the rights of the Company
hereunder in respect of the Letter Agreement or the Letter of Credit) or (ii)
relieve Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported
assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding
sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 



90 Section 9.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without

accordance with the applicable fiduciary duty Laws of The Netherlands.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties hereto

the definitive documentation pertaining to such Debt Financing, be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York,

unconditionally submits to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware (or, only if such court declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, then in the United States District

agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction

or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions: (i) any claim that such
Party is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts as
described herein for any reason; (ii) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such Chosen Court or from any legal process

or otherwise); and (iii) that (A) the Action in any such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Action is improper or (C) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such

jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan, New York, New York, and any appellate court thereof and each Party
hereto submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Action to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (ii) not to bring or permit any of
their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Action
in any other court, (iii) that service of process, summons, notice or document
by registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses provided in
the documentation 

 



91  pertaining to the Debt Financing shall be effective service of process
against them for any such Action brought in any such court, (iv) to waive and
hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which any
of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Action in any such
court, (v) to waive and hereby waive any right to trial by jury in respect of
any such Action and (vi) that a final judgment in any such Action shall be

Section 9.08 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY ACTION (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER
DOCUMENTS AND AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THEREOF.
EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF AN ACTION, (B) SUCH
PARTY HAS CONSIDERED AND UNDERSTANDS THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.08.

Section 9.09 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall have received
a counterpart of this Agreement signed by all of the other Parties. Until and
unless each Party has received a counterpart of this Agreement signed by each
other Party, this Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

Section 9.10 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, including the Annexes and Exhibits hereto, the Company Letter,
taken together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the other documents
delivered in connection with this Agreement, constitutes the entire
agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the Transactions. This
Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties any
rights or remedies; _provided_ that (a) the provisions of Section 6.01 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
indemnified or insured party (including the Indemnified Persons), his or her
heirs and representatives, (b) the provisions of Section 2.05(f) and Section
2.07(c) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
the Independent

 



92  Directors, and (c) the provisions of Section 9.03(c) and the provisions of
Section 9.06, Section 9.07, Section 9.12 and Section 9.13, in each case
pertaining to the Debt Financing Sources, are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, the Debt Financing Sources.

Section 9.11 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated, so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is
not affected in any material way. Upon such a determination, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 9.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy, will occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including each of Buyers
obligations under Section 6.03 with respect to the Letter Agreement and under
Section 6.04 with respect to the Letter of Credit) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to the following
sentence, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other
equitable relief, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
(including with respect to each of Buyers obligations under Section 6.03 with
respect to the Letter Agreement and under Section 6.04 with respect to the
Letter of Credit) and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in the Chosen Courts without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement
or, solely with respect to Buyer under the Letter Agreement, (b) the
provisions set forth in Section 8.03 (i) are not intended to and do not
adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this
Agreement and (ii) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in
any respect any Partys right to specific performance and (c) the right of
specific performance is an integral part of the Transactions and without
that right, none of the Parties would have entered into this Agreement. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this Section 9.12 shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such Order or injunction. In no event
shall the Company or any Related Party be entitled to seek the remedy of
specific performance of this Agreement against the Debt Financing Sources.

Section 9.13 _Waiver of Liability Against Debt Financing Sources_. None of
the Debt Financing Sources will have any liability to the Company, any former,
current or future stockholders, equity holders, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, general or limited partners, members,
managers, agents or Affiliates of the Company, or any former, current or
future direct or indirect stockholder, equity holder, controlling person,
director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member,
manager, agent or Affiliate of any of the foregoing (each, a " _Related
Party_ "), relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or
otherwise, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and

_[Signature Page to Purchase Agreement]_ ANNEX I

 

Offer Conditions

 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or the Offer and in
addition to (and not in limitation of) Buyers right and obligation to extend
and amend the Offer pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement, subject to
any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, Buyer shall not be required
to accept for payment or pay for any Share validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer unless, as of the scheduled Expiration Time:

A. there shall have been validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the
Offer, and not properly withdrawn, a number of Shares (excluding Shares
tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been
delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee prior to the
Expiration Time) that, together with the Shares then owned by Buyer or its
Affiliates, represents at least ninety-five percent (95%) of the outstanding
Shares immediately prior to the Expiration Time (the " _Minimum Condition_
");  _provided_ that if the Asset Sale Resolutions have been adopted at the
EGM, the reference to "ninety five percent (95%)" in the foregoing definition
of Minimum Condition shall be deemed to be a reference to "eighty (80%)"; 
_provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer may, with the Companys prior written
consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, amend at any
time and from time to time any reference to "ninety-five percent (95%)" in
the foregoing definition of Minimum Condition to a percentage not less than
"seventy percent (70%)" (in which case such amendment shall become effective
upon Buyer providing the Company with written notice that it has determined
to effectuate such amendment);

B. any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the
consummation of the Transactions under the HSR Act and the EU Merger
Regulation shall have expired or been terminated and the Other Required
Antitrust Approvals shall have been received and shall not impose a condition
or require a remedy that Buyer is not required to accept or agree to after
giving effect to Section 7.01(h) of the Agreement;

C. no applicable Law or Order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent), entered, enacted, promulgated, enforced or issued by any court or
other Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction (collectively, the "
_Legal Restraints_ ") shall be in effect that prohibits, renders illegal or
enjoins, the consummation of the Offer, the Asset Sale, the Second Step
Distribution or the other Transactions or that imposes a condition or requires
a remedy that Buyer is not required to accept or agree to after giving effect
to Section 7.01(h) of the Agreement;

D. the representations and warranties of the Company (i) set forth in Section
3.11(a) and Section 3.26 of the Agreement shall be true and correct in all
respects as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made as of
the Expiration Time, (ii) set forth in Section 3.05(a) shall be true and
correct in all respects (except for _de minimis_ inaccuracies) as of the
Expiration Time with the same effect as though made as of the Expiration Time
(except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as
of such earlier date), (iii) set forth in Section 3.01, Section 3.02, Section
3.05(b), Section 3.05(c), Section 3.06, Section 3.16(f), Section 3.22 and
Section 3.23 of the Agreement shall be true and correct in all material
respects

 



I-1  as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made as of the
Expiration Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in
which case as of such earlier date) and (iv) set forth in the Agreement,
other than those Sections specifically identified in clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) of this paragraph (D), shall be true and correct (disregarding all
qualifications or limitations as to "materiality", "Company Material Adverse
Effect" and words of similar import set forth therein) as of the Expiration
Time with the same effect as though made as of the Expiration Time (except to
the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such
earlier date), except, in the case of this clause (iv), where the failure to
be true and correct would not have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 

E. the Company shall have performed or complied with in all material respects
each of the obligations, agreements and covenants, required to be performed
by, or complied with by, it under the Agreement at or prior to the Expiration
Time;

F. since the date of the Agreement, there shall not have occurred any Effect
that would have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ that clause (ii) of
the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect shall be excluded from such
definition for the purposes of determining the satisfaction of this paragraph
(F);

G. the resignations of the existing members of the Company Board as
contemplated by Section 2.04(a)(v) of the Agreement shall have been obtained;

H. the Governance Resolutions shall have been adopted at the EGM;

I. the Company shall have delivered to Buyer a certificate signed by an
executive officer of the Company, dated as of the Expiration Time, certifying
that the Offer Conditions specified in paragraphs (D), (E) and (F) have been
satisfied;

 

J. the Internal Reorganization shall have been completed in all material
respects; and

 

K. the Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

The foregoing conditions in this Annex I are for the sole benefit of Buyer and
may be asserted by Buyer regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any
such conditions and, other than the Minimum Condition, may be waived, subject
to applicable Law, by Buyer in whole or in part at any time and from time to
time in its sole discretion, in each case, subject to the terms of
the Agreement. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a
limitation of, the rights and obligations of Buyer to extend, terminate, amend
and/or modify the Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure by
Buyer at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed
a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing
right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time. In addition,
each of the foregoing conditions is independent of any of the other foregoing
conditions; the exclusion of any event from a particular condition does not
mean that such event may not be included in another condition.
