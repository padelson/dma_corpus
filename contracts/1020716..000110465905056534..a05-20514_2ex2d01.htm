 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the covenants, promises
and representations set forth herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

  

 **Article I 
 THE MERGER**

  

 **1.1 _The Merger._** At the Effective Time and subject to and upon
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the "
**Merger** "), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and
the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent. The surviving corporation after the Merger is
hereinafter sometimes referred to as the " **Surviving Corporation**."

  

 **1.2 _Effective Time; Closing._** Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated
by filing a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the "
**Certificate of Merger** ") (the time of such filing with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware (or such later time as may be agreed in
writing by the Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger)
being the

       

" **Effective Time** ") as soon as practicable on the Closing Date. The
closing of the Merger (the " **Closing** ") shall take place at the offices
of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, located at 525 University
Avenue, Suite 1100, Palo Alto, California, at a time and date to be specified
by the parties, which shall be no later than the second Business Day after
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in **Article VI**
(other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the
Closing), or at such other time, date and location as the parties hereto
agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein
as the " **Closing Date**." " **Business Day** " shall mean each day that is
not a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which Parent is closed for business or
banking institutions located in San Francisco, California, are authorized or
obligated by law or executive order to close.

  

 **1.3 _Effect of the Merger._** At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger
and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

 **1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._** At the Effective
Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended and
restated in its entirety to be identical to the Certificate of Incorporation
of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such
Certificate of Incorporation; _provided, however_ , that at the Effective
Time, Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
"The name of the corporation is Intellisync Corporation." At the Effective
Time, the Bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated in their
entirety to be identical to the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in
accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such Bylaws.

  

 **1.5 _Directors and Officers_** _._ Unless otherwise determined by
Parent prior to the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the
Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be
the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
their respective successors are duly appointed. In addition, unless otherwise
determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, Parent, the Company and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the directors and officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the directors and
officers, respectively, of each of the Companys Subsidiaries immediately
after the Effective Time, each to hold office as a director or officer of
each such Subsidiary in accordance with the provisions of the laws of the
respective jurisdiction of organization and the respective bylaws or
equivalent organizational documents of each such Subsidiary.

  

 **1.6 _Effect on Capital Stock_** _._ At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the
Company, the following shall occur:

  

(a) **_Company Common Stock. _**Each share of the Companys common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (together with the associated
Company Rights (as defined in **Section 2.2**) under the Company Rights
Agreement (as defined in **Section 2.2**)) (" **Company Common Stock** ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be
canceled and extinguished and automatically converted (subject to **Section
1.7**) into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to $5.25, without
interest (such amount of cash hereinafter referred to as the " **Merger
Consideration** ") to be distributed in the manner provided in **Section
1.8** (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed

       

certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the
manner provided in **Section 1.10**).

  

(b) **_Cashed-Out Options. _**At the Effective Time, each Company Option
that is either (A) held by any Person other than an employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (each such Company Option, a " **Non-Employee
Option** ") or (B) vested as of the Effective Time, giving effect to any
acceleration of vesting resulting from the Merger (each such Company Option,
a " **Vested Option** ," and together with the Non-Employee Options, the "
**Cashed-Out Options** "), and, in each case, that is unexpired, unexercised
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, terminate in its
entirety at the Effective Time, and the holder of each Cashed-Out Option
shall be entitled to receive therefor an amount of cash (rounded down to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock as to which such Company Option was vested and
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time (giving effect to any
acceleration of vesting resulting from the Merger), and (ii) the excess, if
any, of the per share Merger Consideration over the exercise price of such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each Company Option
that is not a Cashed-Out Option shall be an " **Excepted Option**."

  

(c) **_Cancellation of Treasury and Parent Owned Stock_**. Each share of
Company Common Stock held by the Company or Parent or any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof.

  

(d) **_Capital Stock of Merger Sub_**. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub (the " **Merger Sub Common Stock** ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. After
the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger
Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

  

(e) **_Employee Stock Purchase Plan_**. The Company shall take all actions
necessary or appropriate (including shortening an offering or accelerating a
purchase period), so that effective no later than the Effective Date, the
Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " **Company Purchase Plan** ") will
be terminated and no participants under the Company Purchase Plan will have
any further rights thereunder from and following the Effective Time. To the
extent any offering period under the Company Purchase Plan is in progress
prior to such termination, the Company shall ensure that such offering period
shall end prior to such termination, and that each participants accumulated
contributions for such offering period are applied towards the purchase of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to such termination unless the
participant has previously withdrawn from such offering period in accordance
with the terms of such plan.

  

(f) **_Adjustments to Merger Consideration_**. The Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to
Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

  

 **1.7 _Dissenting Shares._**

  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
any shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who: (i) has not voted in
favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing, (ii) has perfected its
rights to appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law and (iii)
as of the Effective Time has not effectively withdrawn or lost such
holders appraisal

       

rights (collectively, the " **Dissenting Shares** ") shall not be converted
into or represent a right to receive the applicable consideration for Company
Common Stock set forth in **Section 1.6**, but the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are provided by Delaware Law.

  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of **Section 1.7(a)**, if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law,
then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event,
such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only
the right to receive the consideration for Company Common Stock,
as applicable, set forth in **Section 1.6**, without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the certificate representing such shares.

  

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand
for appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions
of Delaware Law and (ii) the opportunity to participate in any
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any
such demands. Any communication to be made by the Company to any holder of
Company Common Stock with respect to such demands shall be submitted to
Parent in advance and shall not be presented to any holder of Company Common
Stock prior to the Company receiving Parents consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld.

  

 **1.8 _Surrender of Certificates._**

  

(a) **_Exchange Agent_**. Parent shall select a national bank or trust
company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as the exchange agent
(the " **Exchange Agent** ") for the Merger and shall enter into a customary
exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent reasonably satisfactory to
the Company.

  

(b) **_Parent to Provide Cash_**. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this **Article
I**, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the full amount of the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to **Section 1.6(a) **in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Any cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " **Exchange Fund**."

  

(c) **_Exchange Procedures_**. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the
Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the " **Certificates** ")
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to **Section 1.6(a)**: (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall otherwise be in customary form)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for cash constituting the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of record of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the cash constituting the
Merger Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from
and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the
right to receive the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company
Common Stock shall have been so converted.

  

(d) **_Required Withholding_**. Each of the Exchange Agent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to

       

this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " **Code** "), or under any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable
Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
the amount of such consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would
otherwise have been paid.

  

(e) **_No Liability_**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
**Section 1.8**, neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation nor
any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

(f) **_Investment of Exchange Fund_**. The Exchange Agent shall invest the
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis;
_provided, however,_ that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this **Article
I**. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall
become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this **Article I**
shall promptly be paid to Parent.

  

(g) **_Termination of Exchange Fund_**. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six months after
the Effective Time shall, at the request of the Surviving Corporation, be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation to be held in trust for such holders
or otherwise according to the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and
any holders of Certificates who have not surrendered such Certificates in
compliance with this **Section 1.8** shall after such delivery to the
Surviving Corporation, subject to **Section 1.8(e)**, look only to the
Surviving Corporation solely as general creditors for the cash constituting
the Merger Consideration (which shall not accrue interest) pursuant to
**Section 1.6(a) **with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented thereby.

  

 **1.9 _ No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_** _._
From and after the Effective Time, the former holders of shares of Company
Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except
as otherwise provided herein or by applicable law. After the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this **Article I**.

  

 **1.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_** _._ In the event
any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, such cash constituting the Merger Consideration; _provided,
however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Company or
the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

 **1.11 _Further Action_** _._ At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company
and Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to
take and do, in the name and on behalf of Company and Merger Sub, any other
actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of the Merger.

 **Article II 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

  

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, subject to
the exceptions specifically disclosed in writing in the disclosure
schedule (referencing the appropriate section or subsection; _provided,
however_ , that any information set forth in one section of the disclosure
schedule shall be deemed to apply to each other section or subsection thereof
to which its relevance is reasonably apparent on its face) supplied by the
Company to Parent dated as of the date hereof (the " **Company Disclosure
Schedule** "), as follows:

  

 **2.1 _Organization; Standing and Power; Charter Documents;
Subsidiaries._**

  

(a) **_Organization; Standing and Power_**. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries are each a corporation or other organization duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation or organization (except, in the case of good standing, for
entities organized under the laws of any jurisdiction that does not recognize
such concept) and each has the requisite power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as currently
conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing and
in good standing would not reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. For purposes of this
Agreement, " **Subsidiary** ," when used with respect to any party, shall
mean any corporation, association, business entity, partnership, limited
liability company or other Person of which such party, either alone or
together with one or more Subsidiaries or by one or more Subsidiaries (i)
directly or indirectly owns or controls securities or other interests
representing more than 50% of the voting power of such Person or (ii) is
entitled, by Contract or otherwise, to elect, appoint or designate directors
constituting a majority of the members of such Persons board of directors or
other governing body. For purposes of this Agreement, " **Contract** " shall
mean any written, oral or other agreement, contract, subcontract, settlement
agreement, lease, binding understanding, instrument, note, option, warranty,
purchase order, license, sublicense, insurance policy, benefit plan or
legally binding, commitment or arrangement, or undertaking of any nature, as
in effect as of the date hereof or as may hereinafter be enforceable against
the Company or its Subsidiaries.

  

(b) **_Charter Documents_**. The Company has Made Available to Parent (i) a
true and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company, each as amended to date (collectively, the " **Company Charter
Documents** ") and (ii) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or
like organizational documents (collectively, " **Subsidiary
Charter Documents** "), of each of its Subsidiaries that is a
"significant subsidiary" within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X
promulgated by the SEC (a " **Significant Subsidiary** "), and each such
instrument is in full force and effect. The Company is not in violation
of any of the provisions of the Company Charter Documents and each of
its Significant Subsidiaries is not in violation of its respective
Subsidiary Charter Documents.

  

(c) **_Subsidiaries_**. **Section 2.1(c) **of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth each Subsidiary of the Company. Other than directors
qualifying shares required under applicable law, the Company is the direct or
indirect owner of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other

or not material, that involves the Companys management that could have a
material effect on the financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, are adequately and promptly disclosed to the Companys
independent auditors and the audit committee of the Companys Board of
Directors. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the

system of internal controls utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries,

Employees in the preparation of financial statements or the internal controls
utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iii) any claim or allegation
regarding any of the foregoing.

contained in **Section 5.3(a)**, in the event that the Company receives
prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company in

**Section 5.3** and that the Companys Board of Directors has in good faith
concluded, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably
possible to result in, a Superior Offer, the Company may then (1) furnish

Company furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such
nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished); and

  

(iii) the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
provide such information or enter into such discussion or negotiations would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the Board of Directors
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable law.

  

(d) **_Change of Recommendation_**. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in **Section 5.3(a)**, in response to the receipt of a
Superior Offer, (x) the Board of Directors of the Company may withhold,

to the stockholders of the Company, may recommend that the stockholders of
the Company accept the tender or exchange offer (any of the foregoing
actions, whether by the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee
thereof, a " **Change of Recommendation** "), (y) the Board of Directors of
the Company, the Company or its Subsidiaries (including each of their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents or other representatives)
may approve, endorse, or recommend any Superior Offer or recommend a Superior
Offer, or (z) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may execute or enter
into or propose to execute or enter into any letter of intent or similar

making the Superior Offer and (C) that the Company intends to effect a Change
of Recommendation;

  

(iv) after delivering the Change of Recommendation Notice, the Company
shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement during such three-Business Day
period, and negotiate in good faith with respect thereto during such three-
Business Day period, as would enable the Company to proceed with its
recommendation to stockholders in favor of adoption of this Agreement without
making a Change of Recommendation;

  

(v) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined (A) after
consultation with its financial advisor, that the terms of the Superior Offer
are more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the Merger (as it
may be adjusted pursuant to paragraph (iv) above) and (B) after consultation
with outside legal counsel, the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation
would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the Board of Directors

provisions set forth in **Section 5.2** or this **Section 5.3**.

shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall not effect a Change of Recommendation unless
specifically permitted pursuant to the terms of  **Section 5.3(d)**.

  

(f) **_State Takeover Statute_** _._ The Board of Directors of the Company
shall not, in connection with any Change of Recommendation, take any action
to change the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company for purposes

prior to the Effective Time to (i) all of the properties, books, contracts,
personnel, commitments and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries

business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) and all
capitalization and equity compensation information that is necessary for
Parent to promptly comply with the requirements of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards 123 (revised 2004) "Share-Based Payments" promulgated by

registered accountants, and which shall be made available in the form that
the Company or its independent registered accountants possess it) and (ii)
all other information concerning the business, properties and personnel
(subject to reasonable procedures as the parties may agree) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request; _provided, however_ ,
that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that any
law, treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity

       

applicable to the Company requires such party to restrict or prohibit access
to any such properties or information. Parent shall not use any information
obtained from the Company or any of its Subsidiary pursuant to the access
contemplated by this **Section 5.4** for any purposes other than in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent
will not share, provide or sell such information to any third party or use
the information in any manner that would result in a violation of any
applicable law. Subject to the foregoing proviso, the Company agrees to
promptly provide to Parent and its accountants, counsel and other
representatives copies of such internal financial statements (including Tax
Returns and supporting documentation) as may be reasonably requested. Any
information obtained from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
the access contemplated by this **Section 5.4** shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

(c) **_No Modification of Representations and Warranties or Covenants_**.
No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation or notification
pursuant to this **Section 5.4, Section 5.6** or **Section 5.7**, or
otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
contained herein, the covenants or agreements of the parties hereto or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement.

  

 **5.5** ** _Public Disclosure_** _._ Without limiting any other
provision of this Agreement, Parent and the Company will consult with each
other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon and use all reasonable efforts to agree on any press release or

contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and any Acquisition Proposal and

any other applicable national or regional securities exchange or market. The
parties have agreed to the text of the joint press release announcing the
signing of this Agreement.

  

 **5.6** ** _Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Efforts_** _._

  

(a) **_Regulatory Filings_**. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall coordinate and cooperate with one another and shall each use all
reasonable efforts to comply with, and shall each refrain from taking any
action that would impede compliance with, all Legal Requirements, and as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof, each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall make all filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, application or submission of other
documents required by any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation: (i)
Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the DOJ as required by the HSR

parties hereto and (iii) any filings required under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any applicable state or securities or "blue sky" laws and the
securities laws of any foreign country, or any other Legal Requirement
relating to the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company will cause all
documents that it is responsible for filing with any Governmental Entity
under this **Section 5.6(a)** to comply in all material respects with all
applicable Legal Requirements. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each shall
promptly supply the other with any information that may be required in order
to effectuate any filings or application pursuant to this **Section
5.6(a)**.

  

(b) **_Notification_**. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will
notify the other promptly upon the receipt of (i) any comments from any
officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made
pursuant hereto and (ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental
Entity for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or
information provided to comply in all material respects with, any
Legal Requirements. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be

       

set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to
**Section 5.6(a)**, Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be,
will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing
with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement.

  

(c) **_Commercially Reasonable Efforts_**. Subject to the express
provisions of **Section 5.2** and **Section 5.3** hereof and upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein, each of the parties agrees to
use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to

commercially reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim,
action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii)
the defending of any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) the execution
or delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the

Agreement; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall this **Section 5.6(c)

and adversely affect Parent or its affiliates (other than Merger Sub)
following the consummation of the Merger. In connection with and without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any
takeover statute or similar Legal Requirement is or becomes applicable to the
Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Legal Requirement on the Merger,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(d) **_No Divestiture_** _. ** **_Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary and except as set forth below, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or any Subsidiary or
affiliate thereof to agree to any Action of Divestiture, except (i) to the
extent such Action of Divestiture would not have a material consequence on
Parent or (ii) with respect to any business of Person that Parent enters into
a definitive binding agreement to acquire, or acquires, following the date
hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, an " **Action of Divestiture**
" shall mean (i) any license, sale or other disposition or holding
separate (through establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any shares of
capital stock or of any business, assets or properties of Parent, its
subsidiaries or affiliates, (ii) the imposition of any limitation on the
ability of Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates to conduct their respective
businesses or own any capital stock or assets or to acquire, hold or exercise
full rights of ownership of their respective businesses or (iii) the
imposition of any impediment on Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates, under
any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, order or other legal
restraint governing competition, monopolies or restrictive trade practices.

  

 **5.7** ** _Notification of Certain Matters_** _._

  

(a) **_By the Company_**. The Company shall give notice to Parent and
Merger Sub promptly after the Company determines in good faith that to the
Companys Knowledge (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained
in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set
forth in **Section** **6.2(a) **would not be satisfied, (ii) any failure
of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or

       

satisfied by it under this Agreement such that the condition set forth in
**Section 6.2(b) **would not be satisfied or (iii) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which could
reasonably be expected to cause the failure of any conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under  **Section 6.2**;
_provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations or warranties of the Company or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement; _provided, further_ , that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this **Section 5.7(a) **shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder.

  

(b) **_By Parent_**. Parent and Merger Sub shall give notice to the Company
promptly after it determines in good faith that, to its knowledge (i) any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming
untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in **Section 6.3(a)
**would not be satisfied, (ii) any failure of Parent to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement such that the condition
set forth in **Section 6.3(b) **would not be satisfied or (iii)
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which could reasonably be expected to cause the failure of any
conditions to the obligations of the Company under **Section 6.3**; 
_provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations or warranties of Parent and Merger Sub or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; _provided, further_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this **Section 5.7(b)
**shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder.

  

 **5.8** ** _Third-Party Consents_** _._ As soon as practicable
following the date hereof, the Company will use all commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such material consents, waivers and approvals under any of
its or its Subsidiaries respective Contracts required to be obtained in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as
may be reasonably requested by Parent after consultation with the Company,
including all material consents, waivers and approvals set forth in **Section
2.3(b) **of the Company Disclosure Schedule. In connection with seeking
such consents, waivers and approvals, the Company shall keep Parent informed
of all material developments and shall, at Parents request, include Parent
in any discussions or communications with any parties whose consent, waiver
or approval is sought hereunder. Such consents, waivers and approvals shall
be in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent; _provided, however_ , that
with respect to the consents, waivers or approvals required under **Section
5.8** of the Company Disclosure Schedule, Parent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine the form thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
neither party shall be required to pay or commit to pay any material amount
to (or incur any material obligation in favor of) any Person from whom any
such consent may be required, and (ii) the failure to obtain any consents,
waivers and approvals pursuant to this **Section 5.8** shall not be deemed a
failure of any conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under
**Section 6.2(b)**.

  

 **5.9** ** _Equity Awards and Employee Matters_** _._

  

(a) **_Assumption of Certain Employee Stock Options_**. ** **Subject to
**Sections 5.9(b) **and  **(c)** , at the Effective Time, each
then outstanding Excepted Option, regardless of the respective exercise
prices thereof, will be assumed by Parent or Nokia Corporation. Except as
described below, each Excepted Option so assumed by Parent or Nokia
Corporation under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to,
substantially similar vesting schedules, and substantially similar duration
and expiration dates as set forth in the applicable Company Option documents
(including any applicable stock option agreement or other document evidencing
such Company Option) immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i)
each Excepted Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in
accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Nokia
Corporation Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Excepted Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any
acceleration of vesting which applies to such Excepted Option under any
Company Employee Plan in

       

existence on the date of this Agreement as a result of the transactions
effectuated by this Agreement) multiplied by the ratio of the value of the
per share Merger Consideration to the value of the closing price for a share
of Nokia Corporation Common Stock on the trading day immediately prior to the
Closing Date (such ratio, the " **Option Ratio** "), rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Nokia Corporation Common Stock, (ii) the
per share exercise price for the shares of Nokia Corporation Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such assumed Excepted Option will be equal to the
quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which such Excepted Option was exercisable immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Option Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent, (iii) all options shall be converted into nonqualified stock options,
even if they were granted as "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section
422 of the Code) and (iv) certain terms of the assumed Excepted Options shall
be adjusted to conform the Company Options to the terms of the applicable
Parent or Nokia Corporation equity plan, including conversion of the vesting
schedule from monthly vesting to quarterly vesting. The Company will not take
any action to accelerate the vesting of any Excepted Options beyond what is
required under the terms of any Company Employee Plan in effect on the date
of this Agreement.

  

(b) **_Section 409A of the Code_**. ** **Notwithstanding **Section 5.9(a)
**to the contrary, Parent or Nokia Corporation shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to effectuate the conversion of Excepted Options provided
for in **Section 5.9(a) **in a manner that will not to give rise to adverse
tax consequences or penalties to the holder of the Excepted Option under
Section 409A of the Code.

  

(c) **_Option Cashouts_**. ** **Notwithstanding anything in **Section
5.9(a) **to the contrary, in the event that Parent, in its sole discretion,
determines that it is not in the best interests of the Company, Parent or a
holder of an Excepted Option, to have either Parent or Nokia Corporation
assume an Excepted Option, then Parent shall, no later than 30 days prior to
the Effective Time, determine that such option shall be cashed out pursuant
to **Section 1.6(b) **of this Agreement, and such Excepted Option shall
treated as a Cashed-Out Option for all purposes of this Agreement. Parent
shall timely communicate to the Company and the holder of the Excepted Option
its decision to cash out Excepted Options pursuant to this **Section
5.9(c)**.

  

(d) **_Notices_**. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later
than ten business days following the Effective Time, Parent will use all
reasonable efforts to issue to each holder of an Excepted Option a
confirmation (in written or electronic form) evidencing the assumption of
such Excepted Option by Parent or Nokia Corporation.

  

(e) **_Registration_**. To the extent necessary and appropriate, Parent or
Nokia Corporation shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 and on Form
S-3 or such other available form (for those awards which are not eligible
for registration on Form S-8 and with respect to which no exemption
is available) for the shares of Nokia Corporation Common Stock issuable
with respect to Excepted Options as soon as is reasonably practicable and
shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statements for so long as any of such converted Excepted
Options remain outstanding.

   

43   

  

(f) **_Termination of 401(k) Plans_**. Effective as of no later than the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of the Company,
its Subsidiaries and any ERISA Affiliate shall terminate any and all
Company Employee Plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k)
arrangement (each, a " **401(k) Plan**") unless Parent provides written
notice to the Company that any such 401(k) plan shall not be terminated.
Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than ten
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent
with evidence that such 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of
no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to
resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company, its Subsidiaries or
such ERISA Affiliate, as the case may be. Parent shall take all steps
necessary to permit each Employee who has received an eligible rollover
distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from each 401(k)
Plan, if any, to roll such eligible rollover distribution as part of any lump
sum distribution to the extent permitted by each 401(k) Plan into an account
under Parents 401(k) plan (the " **Parent s 401(k) Plan**"), to the extent
permitted by Parents 401(k) Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
eligible rollover distributions referenced in this **Section 5.9(f) **shall
include any participant loans, but solely to the extent that such loans
comply and have at all times complied with applicable law and the terms of
the applicable Company 401(k) Plan and accepting such rollover will not
adversely affect the tax qualification status of, or otherwise adversely
affect, Parents 401(k) Plan.

  

(g) **_Benefit Plans_**. Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to
each person who was an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who remains an employee of the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries or becomes an employee of Parent
immediately following the Effective Time (" **Continuing Employees** "), for a
period of not less than one year from and after the Closing Date (or if
shorter, for so long as such employee remains in such employment), unless any
such employee contracts otherwise with Parent, employee benefits that, in the
aggregate, are no less favorable to such Employee than, at Parents election,
either those benefits provided by Parent to similarly situated employees of
Parent or each of annual base salary and the benefits provided by the Company
and its Subsidiaries to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time (but not taking into account the value of any equity or
equity-related benefits or compensation for purposes of determining the value
of the benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time); provided however, that nothing in this
Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee the right to continue in
employment following the Effective Time, or is intended to interfere with
Parents, the Surviving Corporations and its Subsidiaries rights (i) to
terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee for any reason or no
reason following the Effective Time or (ii) to terminate any Company Employee
Plan, or the right of any Continuing Employee to terminate his or her own
employment for any or no reason following the Effective Time. To the extent
that Continuing Employees participate in any of Parents employee benefit
plans, programs, policies and arrangements, including, but not limited to,
any severance plan, medical plan, dental plan, life insurance plan, Code
Section 401(k) arrangement, vacation program or disability plan
(collectively, the " **Parent Benefit Plans** "), such Continuing Employees
shall receive credit for purposes of eligibility, level of benefits, benefit
accrual and vesting under the Parent Benefit Plans in which such Continuing
Employees participate to the same extent such Continuing Employees were
credited with service under comparable plans of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for such purposes; provided, however, that no such employee
shall be entitled to such credit (i) to the extent that it results in
duplication of benefits, or (ii) for purposes of any incentive compensation
or sabbatical plan, policy, program, agreement or arrangement, or any
arrangement similar to the foregoing. With respect to any Parent Benefit Plan
that is a welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent for the benefit of
Continuing Employees on and after the Closing Date, Parent shall (1)
cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing
condition limitations to the extent such requirements and limitations were
waived under comparable plans maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, and (2) for the plan

       

year that includes the Effective Time, give effect, in determining any
deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, amounts paid during the
plan year that included the Effective Time by such Continuing Employees with
respect to similar plans maintained by Company and its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement but solely to the
extent permitted by applicable law, on or prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) to each Continuing Employee the cash
value of any and all accrued but unused vacation to which each such
Continuing Employee is entitled as of the Closing Date, provided, however,
that the Companys obligations to cash out accrued but unused vacation shall
be contingent upon Parent causing, as of the Closing Date, each Continuing
Employee to participate in Parents vacation policy then in effect for
similarly situated employees of Parent, and to accrue such amount of
vacation, as of the Effective Time, as indicated pursuant to the terms of
such plan.

  

 **5.10 _Indemnification_**.

  

(a) **_Indemnity_**. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will and
will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company pursuant to the indemnification agreements between
the Company and its directors and officers in effect as of the date hereof
and listed in **Section 5.10(a)** of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(including, to the extent indemnifiable thereunder, for acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) (the " **Indemnified
Parties** "), subject to applicable law. The certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to
exculpation, indemnification and the advancement of expenses that are at
least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the
date hereof, which provisions will not, except as required by law, be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of Indemnified Parties or any other person who, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply if Parent
assumes and honors any obligations to indemnify such persons to the extent
provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in
effect immediately prior to the date hereof.

  

(b) **_Insurance_**. For a period of six years after the Effective Time,
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain directors and
officers liability insurance with one or more reputable unaffiliated third-
party insurers covering those persons who are covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy as of the date hereof for
events occurring prior to the Effective Time of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the
insured than those applicable to the current directors and officers of the
Company under policies maintained by the Company ; _provided, however_ , that
in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one
year in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company
for such coverage (and to the extent annual premium would exceed 250% of the
annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage, the
Surviving Corporation shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be
maintained the maximum amount of coverage as is available for such 250% of
such annual premium); and _provided, further, however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may satisfy its obligations under this
**Section 5.10(b)** by purchasing a "tail" policy under the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policy which (i) has an effective
term of six years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers those persons who are
currently covered by the Companys directors and officers insurance policy
in effect as of the date hereof for actions and omissions occurring on or
prior to the Effective Time and (iii) contains terms and conditions that are
no less favorable to the insured than those of the Companys directors and
officers insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof.

       

(c) **_Third-Party Beneficiaries_**. This  **Section 5.10** is intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties
and their heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent
and the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns,
and shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract
or otherwise. On and after the Closing, the obligations of Parent under
**Section 5.10(a) **shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as
to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party under **Section
5.10(a) **without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. In the
event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or its successor or assign (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successor and assign of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, honor the obligations set forth with respect to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, in this **Section 5.10**.

  

 **5.11** ** _Section 16 Matters_**. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted
under applicable law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by **Article I** of this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

 **5.12** ** _Termination of Certain Company Contracts_** _._

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall effectively terminate all
Contracts between either the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the
Persons listed on  **Section 5.12(a)(i) **of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, other than the agreements set forth on **Section 5.12(a)(ii) **of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. To the extent that any notice is required
under any Contract prior to such Contracts termination pursuant to this
**Section 5.12(a)**, such notice shall be provided sufficiently in advance
of the Effective Time to allow any applicable notice period thereunder to
have terminated in accordance with the terms of such Contract prior to the
Effective Time.

  

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any
Contract with respect to or otherwise binding upon any Intellectual Property
or Intellectual Property Rights of Parent or any of its affiliates, other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

(c) From the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the Effective
Time, the Company shall take all reasonably necessary steps, including,
without limitation, making inquiries to relevant product managers and project
managers, to verify the Companys compliance with **Sections 5.12 (a)
**and  **(b)**. To the extent that the Company or its Subsidiaries enters
into such contracts referred to in **Section 5.12(b)**, the Company or its
Subsidiaries shall terminate such contracts prior to the Effective Time.

  

 **5.13** ** _Company Rights Plan_**. The Company shall not redeem the
Company Rights or amend or modify (including by delay of the
"Distribution Date" thereunder), other than to render the Company Rights
inapplicable to the Merger or any action permitted under this Agreement, or
terminate the Company Rights Plan prior to the earlier of the Effective Time
or the termination of this Agreement unless, and only to the extent that, it
is required to do so by order of a court of competent jurisdiction or in
connection with the entry by the Company into a definitive binding agreement
with respect to a Superior Offer pursuant to and in compliance with **Section
5.3(d)**.

threatened suit, action or proceeding asserted by any Required Authority
challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the

       

effect of which restraint or prohibition if obtained would cause the
condition set forth in **Section 6.1(b) **to not be satisfied.

received a certificate dated as of the Closing Date to the effect that
conditions set forth in **Sections 6.2(a) and (b)** have been satisfied

shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date
with the same force and effect as if made on the Closing Date (except that
those representations and warranties which address matters only as of a
particular date shall have been true and correct only on such date), except,
in each case, or in the aggregate, as does not materially impede
the authority of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof and
applicable Legal Requirements. The Company shall have received a certificate
with respect to the foregoing signed on behalf of Parent, with respect to the
representations and warranties of Parent, by an authorized executive officer

 **Article VII** 
 TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

  

 **7.1** ** _Termination_** _._ This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Effective Time, by action taken by the terminating party or
parties, and except as provided below, whether before or after the requisite
approvals of the stockholders of the Company:

  

(a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of
each of Parent and the Company;

  

(b) by either the Company or Parent if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by May 15, 2006, which date shall be extended to July 14, 2006 if
the Merger shall not have been consummated as a result of a failure to
satisfy the conditions set forth in **Section 6.1(c)** (the " **End Date**
"); _provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this **Section 7.1(b)** shall not be available to any party whose action or
failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of
the Merger to occur on or before such date and such action or failure to act
constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

  

(c) by either the Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (including the
failure to have taken an action), in any case having the effect of
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, which
order, decree, ruling or other action is final and nonappealable;

       

(d) by either the Company or Parent if the required approval of the
stockholders of the Company contemplated by this Agreement shall not have
been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a
meeting of the Company stockholders duly convened therefore or at any
adjournment thereof; _provided, however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this **Section 7.1(d)** shall not be available to the
Company where the failure to obtain such stockholder approval shall have been
caused by the action or failure to act of the Company, and such action or
failure to act constitutes a breach by the Company of this Agreement;

  

(e) by Parent (at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
required vote of the stockholders of the Company) if a Triggering Event with
respect to the Company shall have occurred;

  

(f) by the Company, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of Parent shall have become untrue, in either case
such that the conditions set forth in **Section 6.3(a)** or **Section
6.3(b) **would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the
time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue;
_provided, however_ , that if such inaccuracy in Parents representations
and warranties or breach by Parent is curable by Parent prior to the End Date
through the exercise of reasonable efforts, then the Company may not
terminate this Agreement under this **Section 7.1(f)** prior to 30 days
following the receipt of written notice from the Company to Parent of such
breach provided Parent continues to exercise all reasonable efforts to cure
such breach through such 30-day period (it being understood that the Company
may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph **(f)** if it
shall have materially breached this Agreement or if such breach by Parent is
cured within such 30-day period);

  

(g) by Parent, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in either
case such that the conditions set forth in **Section 6.2(a)** or **Section
6.2(b)**would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the
time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue;
_provided, however_ , that if such inaccuracy in the Companys
representations and warranties or breach by the Company is curable by the
Company prior to the End Date through the exercise of reasonable efforts,
then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this **Section
7.1(g)** prior to 30 days following the receipt of written notice from Parent
to the Company of such breach provided the Company continues to exercise
all reasonable efforts to cure such breach through such 30-day period
(it being understood that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this paragraph (g) if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or
if such breach by the Company is cured within such 30-day period); and

  

(h) by the Company, if, the Company shall have entered into a definitive
binding agreement with respect to a Superior Offer pursuant to and in
compliance with **Section 5.3(d)**, and the Company shall have paid
Parent the Termination Fee described in **Section 7.3(b)**.

  

For the purposes of this Agreement, a " **Triggering Event** ," with respect
to the Company, shall be deemed to have occurred if: (i) its Board of
Directors or any committee thereof shall for any reason have withdrawn or
shall have amended or modified in a manner adverse to Parent
its recommendation in favor of the adoption of the Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company, (ii) it shall have failed to include in the
Proxy Statement the recommendation of its Board of Directors in favor of the
adoption of the Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, (iii) its Board
of Directors shall have approved or recommended any Acquisition Proposal,
(iv) the Company shall have entered into any letter of intent or similar
document or any agreement; contract or commitment accepting any Superior
Offer, following notice of such Superior Offer to Parent as promptly as
practicable (and in any event no later than 24 hours) after the Companys
Board of Directors has determined, in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisors that the failure to take
such action with respect to the

       

Superior Offer would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the
Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable law, and a reasonable opportunity to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement during the five-Business Day period
following such notice, as would enable the Company to proceed with the
Merger, (v) a tender or exchange offer relating to its securities shall have
been commenced by a Person unaffiliated with Parent, and the Company shall
not have sent to its security holders pursuant to Rule 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, within ten Business Days after such tender or
exchange offer is first published, sent or given, a statement disclosing that
the Board of Directors of the Company recommends rejection of such tender or
exchange offer, (vi) the Company materially breaches any of its obligations
set forth in **Section 5.2** or **Section 5.3**,  _provided, however,_ that
with respect to any breach by the Company of **Section 5.3**, such breach
is willful, **** or (vii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
resolved to do any of the foregoing.

  

 **7.2** ** _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_** _._ Any
termination of this Agreement under **Section 7.1** above will be effective
immediately upon the delivery of a valid written notice of the terminating
party to the other party hereto. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in **Section 7.1**, this Agreement shall be of no
further force or effect, except (i) as set forth in **Section
5.4(a)**, this **Section 7.2**, **Section 7.3** and **Article VIII** ,
each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement and (ii)
nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach
of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the
obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of
which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance
with their terms.

  

 **7.3 _Fees and Expenses_** _._

  

(a) **_General_**. Except as set forth in this **Section 7.3**, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses
whether or not the Merger is consummated; _provided, however_ , that Parent
and the Company shall share equally the fees in connection with (i) the
filing the Notification and Report Forms filed with the FTC and DOJ under the
HSR Act, and all premerger notification and reports forms under similar
applicable laws of other jurisdictions, in each case pursuant to **Section
5.6(a)**, **** and **** (ii) the filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy
Statement (including SEC filing fees) and any preliminary materials related
thereto; and _provided, further_ , that Parent shall reimburse the Company
for its expenses with respect to the virtual data room posted on a website
maintained by Merrill Corporation in which the Companys documents were Made
Available to Parent.

  

(b) **_Company Payment_** _._

  

(i) **_Payment_**. The Company shall promptly, but in no event later than
two Business Days after the date of termination pursuant to the sections of
this Agreement as set forth below, pay Parent a fee equal to $14,120,000 in
immediately available funds (the " **Termination Fee** ") in the event that
this Agreement is (i) terminated by Parent pursuant to **Section
7.1(e)**, (ii) terminated by the Company pursuant to **Section 7.1(h)**, 
_provided, however_ , in the case of termination under **Section
7.1(h)**, payment of the Termination Fee by the Company shall be made prior
to such termination, or (iii) terminated by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, pursuant to **Section 7.1(b)**, **Section 7.1(d)** or **Section
7.1(g)**, _provided, however_ , in the case of termination pursuant to
**Section 7.1(g)**, that the breach by the Company giving rise to
termination is willful; _provided, further,_ that in the case of termination
pursuant to **Section 7.1(b)**,  **Section 7.1(d), Section 7.1(e)** or
**Section 7.1(g)**, (a) such payment shall be made only if prior to the
termination of this Agreement, there has been disclosure publicly of
an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company and within 12 months
following the termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition of the Company is
consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement or letter of

       

intent with respect to an Acquisition of the Company and (b) such payment
shall be made promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days after
the consummation of such Acquisition of the Company or the entry into such
definitive agreement or letter of intent by the Company.

  

(ii) **_Interest; Other Remedies_**. The Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this **Section 7.3(b)** are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the
Company fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this
**Section 7.3(b)**, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a
claim for the amounts set forth in this **Section 7.3(b)**, the non-
prevailing party shall pay to the prevailing party the reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) of the
prevailing party incurred in connection with such suit, and provided that
Parent is the prevailing party, the Company shall pay to Parent interest on
the amounts due pursuant to this **Section 7.3(b)** at the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.
Payment of the fees described in this **Section 7.3(b)** shall not be in
lieu of damages incurred in the event of breach of this Agreement.

  

(iii) **_Certain Definitions_**. For the purposes of this **Section
7.3(b)** only, " **Acquisition** ," with respect to a party hereto, shall mean
any of the following transactions (other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement): (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the party pursuant to which the equity interests held in such party and

such transaction by the stockholders of the party immediately preceding such
transaction constitute less than 50% of the aggregate equity interests in the
surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or any direct or indirect
parent thereof, (ii) a sale or other disposition by the party of assets
representing in excess of 40% of the aggregate fair market value of the

or issuance by the party or such Person or group), directly or indirectly, of
beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares
representing in excess of 40% of the voting power of the then outstanding
shares of capital stock of the party.

  

 **7.4** ** _Amendment_** _._ Subject to applicable law, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by
their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after adoption of
this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company; _p_ _r ovided, however_,
that after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no
amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by the
stockholders of the Company without such further stockholder approval. This
Agreement may not be amended except by execution of an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.

  

 **7.5** ** _Extension; Waiver_** _._ At any time prior to the Effective
Time either party hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective
Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed: (i) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered

the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.
Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement, including pursuant to
**Section 7.1(b)**, shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

or were otherwise breached.

document.

Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without
the prior written approval of the other parties, except that Parent may
assign its rights and delegate its obligations hereunder to any of its

Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
