262 of the DGCL with respect to such Shares (each Share referred to in
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above being an " _Excluded Share_ " and
collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ "), shall be converted into the right to
receive $31.25 in cash (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ " and the sum
of all such payments, the " _Total Common Stock Merger Consideration_ "),
without interest. Except as provided in Section 2.6(d), at the Effective Time,
all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a "
_Certificate_ ", it being understood that any reference herein to "
_Certificate_ " shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of Shares) which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of such Shares, without interest.

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share (other than any
Shares that Parent elects to have converted into shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.6(d)) shall be cancelled and
retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist, subject to the right of the Record Holder of any Dissenting Shares to
receive the payment referred to in Section 2.7(f) with respect to such
Dissenting Shares.

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Treasury Shares; Shares Owned by Company Subsidiaries_. Any Share owned
by the Company (whether held in treasury or otherwise) or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company shall not represent the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration and shall be treated as an
Excluded Share pursuant to Section 2.6(a) and Section 2.6(b), unless Parent
elects in writing prior to the Effective Time for such Share to be converted
in connection with the Merger into one share of a class of stock of the
Surviving Corporation designated by Parent.

2.7. _Payment_.

 



4 (a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the
Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) (the
" _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the Record Holders of Shares, for
exchange in accordance with this Article II through the Paying Agent, a cash
amount in immediately available funds not less than the Total Common Stock
Merger Consideration (such aggregate cash amount as deposited with the Paying
Agent being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). If, after
the Effective Time, a Dissenting Stockholder effectively withdraws its demand
for, or loses its right to, appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with
respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the number of Dissenting Shares for which the Dissenting
Stockholder has withdrawn its demand for, or lost its right to, appraisal
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the Per Share Merger
Consideration. If at any time the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make
the aggregate payments contemplated by Section 2.6(a), Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly deposit such additional cash
amounts in immediately available funds as is necessary to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to
make such aggregate payments.

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. Promptly (and in any event within two Business
Days) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each Record Holder of Shares (other than Excluded
Shares to the extent such Record Holder does not also hold Shares that are not
Excluded Shares) a letter of transmittal in customary form and with such
other provisions as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree and
instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates representing such Shares
and determining the amount to which such Record Holder is entitled as a result
of the Merger.

(ii) _Payment for Shares_. Upon delivery to the Paying Agent of such letter of
transmittal by any Record Holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), duly
completed and signed in accordance with its instructions, together with such
other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions
and surrender of the Certificate (if any) that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented such Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof
as provided in Section 2.7(e), or, if such Shares are held in book-entry or
other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry transfer agent
of the surrender of such Shares on a book-entry account statement), such
Record Holder shall be entitled to receive from the Exchange Fund a cash
amount in immediately available funds equal to the number of such
Shares multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration, and, if applicable,
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be

 



5  cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable as
provided above. Risk of loss of and title to any Certificate will pass only
upon proper delivery as provided above. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the
Company, a check for any cash to be delivered upon compliance with the
procedures described above may be issued to the transferee if the
applicable letter of transmittal and the Certificate representing such Shares
is presented to the Paying Agent and is accompanied by all documents
reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. The Per Share Merger
Consideration paid with respect to any Share in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Share.

 

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Person presents
to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Paying Agent any Certificates or any
transfer instructions relating to Shares cancelled in the Merger, such Person
shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to in Section
2.7(b)(i) and instructed to comply with the instructions set forth therein in
order to receive any cash to which such Person may be entitled with respect
to such Shares pursuant to this Article II.

(d)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the Record Holders of Shares on the date that is twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation. Any Record Holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration
for such Shares upon compliance with the instructions in the form of letter
of transmittal referred to in Section 2.7(b)(i), without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to
any Record Holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Record Holder claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Record Holder of a
bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount equal to the number of Shares formerly represented by 

 



6  such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

 

(f) _Dissenting Shares_. No Person who, prior to the Effective Time, has
perfected a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to any Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration with respect to such Dissenting Shares unless and
until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn (in accordance with
Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or lost such Persons right to appraisal pursuant
to the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares. Unless and until a
Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively so withdrawn or lost such
Dissenting Stockholders right to appraisal pursuant to the DGCL with respect
to such Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to
receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to
such Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of
any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and
any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by
the Company relating to Company stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings which take
place prior to the Effective Time with respect to demands for appraisal by
Company stockholders under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to Record Holders of Shares or holders of Company Options or
Company Restricted Stock Awards pursuant to this Agreement such Taxes as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "). To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such deducted and withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Record Holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Paying Agent, as
the case may be.

2.8. _Stock Options and Restricted Stock; Employee Stock Purchase Plan_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding
option to purchase Shares granted pursuant to any of the Company Option Plans
(each, a " _Company Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall automatically,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of
such Company

 



7  Option, become fully vested and converted into the right to receive,
immediately after the Effective Time (without interest thereon), a cash
payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (x) the total number of
Shares issuable upon exercise of such Company Option as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Company Option
(the " _Option Cash Payment_ ", and the sum of all such payments, the " _Total
Option Cash Payments_ "). As of the Effective Time, all Company Options shall
automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Option Cash Payment.

(b)  _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. As of the Effective Time, each award of
restricted stock granted pursuant to any of the Company Option Plans (each, a
" _Company Restricted Stock Award_ ") that is outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of such
Company Restricted Stock Award, become fully vested and converted into the
right to receive, immediately after the Effective Time, without interest
thereon, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (x) the
total number of Shares subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration (the " _Restricted Stock Award Payment_ " and the sum of all
such payments, the " _Total Restricted Stock Award Payments_ "). As of the
Effective Time, all Company Restricted Stock Awards shall automatically cease
to exist, and each holder of a Company Restricted Stock Award shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Restricted Stock Award Payment.

 

(c) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that (i) no offering period under the ESPP shall be
commenced on or after July 1, 2011, (ii) no new participants may join the
offering period in existence under the ESPP on or after the date of this
Agreement and (iii) no participant may increase the amount of his or her
salary deferrals with respect to such offering period. All outstanding
purchase rights under the ESPP shall automatically be exercised, in accordance
with the terms of the ESPP, at the end of the offering period that commences
on or about April 1, 2011. The Company shall cause the ESPP to terminate with
such purchase, and no further purchase rights shall be granted or exercised
under the ESPP thereafter. If the Closing shall occur prior to the end of the
offering period beginning on or about April 1, 2011, the Company shall cause
a new exercise date to be set under the ESPP, which date shall be the Business
Day immediately prior to the anticipated Closing Date.

 

(d) _Payments_. Promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) pay to (i) each holder of a Company Option the
amount of the aggregate

 



8  Option Cash Payment due and payable to such holder pursuant to Section
2.8(a), and (ii) each holder of a Company Restricted Stock Award the amount of
the aggregate Restricted Stock Award Payment due and payable to such holder
pursuant to Section 2.8(b).

(e) _Company Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the Compensation Committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt such resolutions and take such actions as are
necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.8. 

2.9. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company changes the number of
Shares issued and outstanding as a result of a reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly
adjusted to reflect such change and to provide the holders of Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to the occurrence of
such event, and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event,
be the Per Share Merger Consideration.

ARTICLE III 

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

Merger Sub), except, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, for
any such conflict, violation, breach, default, termination, acceleration,
alteration, Lien or other occurrence that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by the Company
do not and will not require any consent, approval, authorization, waiver,
registration, declaration or permit of, action by, filing with or notification

3.5. _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Company has timely filed or furnished, as applicable, each form, proxy
statement, certification, report and other document required to be filed or
furnished by the Company with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act since July 1, 2009 (the " _Applicable Date_ ") (together with
all exhibits and schedules thereto and all information incorporated therein
by reference, and including any amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Company Reports_ "). As of their respective dates, each of the Company
Reports complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and any rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As of
their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the
date of such amendment, taking into the account the content of the amendment),
the Company Reports did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading. The Company has made available to Parent correct
and complete copies of all material correspondence between the SEC, on the
one hand, and the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
occurring since the Applicable Date and prior to the date hereof (other than
those that are publicly available). Except as set forth on Section 3.5(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof, there are no

outstanding SEC comment or outstanding SEC investigation.

 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in and in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) effective to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP. The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in and in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) effective to ensure that
material information required to be disclosed by the Company is reported on a
timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the
Companys filings with the SEC. The Company has disclosed, based on the most
recent evaluation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
prior to the date of this Agreement, to

 



14  the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board
(A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal control
over financial reporting.

(c) Each of the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports
(including, in each case, the related notes thereto) (the " _Company
Financial Statements_ ") fairly presents, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash
flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the respective periods set forth

ARTICLE IV

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure schedule delivered to the Company by Parent on the date of this
Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being agreed and
acknowledged that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any
other section or subsection to the extent the relevance of such item is
reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure), Parent and Merger Sub
each hereby represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

 



27 4.1. _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has
all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is presently
conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where any such failure to be so qualified
or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available to the
Company complete and correct copies of Parents and Merger Subs certificates
of incorporation and by-laws (or similar governing instruments), each as
amended to the date of this Agreement.

 

4.2. _Corporate Authority and Approval_. No vote of holders of capital stock
of Parent is necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has
all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action
necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, subject to adoption of this Agreement by Parent as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, which shall occur (and evidence of which will
be provided to the Company) immediately, and in any event on the date of the
execution of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and
Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception.

4.3. _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, do not and will not (i) conflict
with or violate the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Parent or
Merger Sub, or (ii) result in any breach or violation of or constitute a
default under, or give rise to any right of termination, acceleration or other
alteration in the rights under, any material Contract not otherwise
terminable by either party thereto upon 90 days or less notice to which Parent
or Merger Sub is a party or by which any of their respective properties,
assets or rights are bound or (iii) assuming compliance with the matters
set forth in Section 4.3(b), violate any provision of Law applicable to
Parent or Merger Sub, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for
any such conflict, violation, breach, default, termination, acceleration,
alteration or other occurrence that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



28 (b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby by Parent and Merger Sub, do not and will not require any
consent, approval, authorization, waiver, registration, declaration or permit
of, action by, filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity,
except for (i) the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, (ii) the applicable requirements of
the HSR Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (iii) the
applicable requirements of the NYSE, (iv) the filing with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware of the Certificate of Merger as required by the
DGCL, (v) the applicable requirements under the NISPOM, (vi) the applicable
requirements under Title 22, Section 122.4 of the ITAR, (vii) the applicable
requirements of the FAR, and (viii) any such consent, approval, authorization,
waiver, registration, declaration, permit, action, filing or notification the
failure of which to make or obtain would not, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

4.4. _Litigation_. There are no Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened against Parent or Merger Sub, or outstanding Orders by
which Parent or Merger Sub are subject or bound that would, individually or
in the aggregate, constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

4.5. _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of
(i) an executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, between
Parent and the Guarantors (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to
which the Guarantors has committed, subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, to invest in Parent, directly or indirectly, the cash amounts set
forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "), (ii) an executed rollover
commitment letter (the " _Rollover Letter_ ") from the Rollover Stockholder to
contribute to Parent, directly or indirectly and subject to the terms and
conditions therein, the amount of Shares set forth therein (the " _Rollover
Investment_ ") and (iii) executed commitment letters, dated as of the date
hereof, among Parent, Merger Sub and the counterparties thereto (the " _Debt
Commitment Letters_ " and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the "
_Financing Letters_ "), pursuant to which the counterparties thereto have
committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend the amounts
set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with the Equity
Financing, the " _Financing_ "). Parent has also delivered to the Company a
true, complete and correct copy of any fee letter in connection with the Debt
Commitment Letters (it being understood that any such fee letter provided to
the Company may be redacted to omit the numerical amounts provided therein)
(any such fee letter, a " _Fee Letter_ ").

 



29 (b) None of the Financing Letters nor the Rollover Letter has been amended or
modified prior to the date of this Agreement (provided that the existence or
exercise of the "flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letters shall not
constitute an amendment or modification of the Financing Letters), and, as of
the date hereof, the respective commitments contained therein have not been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof,
there are no other agreements, side letters or arrangements to which Parent or
Merger Sub is a party relating to the funding or investing, as applicable, of
the full amount of the Financing or the Rollover Investment other than (x) as
expressly set forth in the Financing Letters and the Rollover Letter and
delivered to the Company prior to the entry into force of this Agreement, and
(y) the Fee Letters.

(c) Assuming the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Section 3.2 of this Agreement as of the
Closing Date and performance by the Company in all material respects of its
obligations under Section 5.1, the amount of funds to be provided pursuant to
the Financing Letters, if funded in accordance with the terms of the Financing
Letters and the contribution contemplated by the Rollover Letter will be
sufficient to (i) pay the Total Common Stock Merger Consideration and the
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.8, (ii) repay the principal and interest
on all indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facility, and (iii) pay all
fees and expenses required to be paid at the Closing by Parent or Merger Sub
in connection with the Merger and the Financing.

(d) As of the date hereof, the Financing Letters and the Rollover Letter are
in full force and effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, the other parties thereto (subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception). Other than as expressly set forth in the Rollover Letter,
Financing Letters, and any related Fee Letter, there are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full net
proceeds of the Financing (including any "flex" provisions) under any
agreement relating to the Financing to which Parent or any of its Affiliates
is a party. The Rollover Letter contains all of the conditions precedent to
the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the contribution to Parent
described therein. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred or
circumstance exists which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of the other
parties thereto, under the Financing Letters or the Rollover Letter. Subject
to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, as of the
date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any condition of closing to be satisfied
by it contained in the Financing Letters. As of the date hereof, Parent and
Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, all commitment or
other fees which are due and payable on or prior to the date hereof pursuant
to the terms of the Financing Letters.

 



30 4.6. _Limited Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
the Guarantors have delivered to the Company the duly executed Limited
Guarantee. The Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and is the valid,
binding and enforceable obligation of the Guarantors, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default on the part of the Guarantors under the Limited Guarantee.

 

4.7. _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of Merger
Sub consists solely of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, all of which were duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid
and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time
will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and
has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or
obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and
pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

4.8. _Solvency_. Assuming (i) the representations and warranties of the
Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects as of
the Effective Time, (ii) that the most recent financial forecasts relating to
the Company made available to Parent by the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement have been prepared in good faith and on assumptions that were
reasonable at the time such forecasts were prepared and continue to be
reasonable and (iii) satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to
consummate the Merger, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Financing, the Rollover Investment, the payment
of the Total Common Stock Merger Consideration, the Total Option Cash
Payments, the Total Restricted Stock Award Payments and all other amounts
required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, including payment of all related fees
and expenses), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
will be Solvent at and as of the Effective Time and as of immediately after
the Effective Time. 

4.9. _Absence of Certain Agreements_. As of the date of this Agreement and
except for the Rollover Letter and the Voting Agreement, neither Parent nor
any of its Affiliates has entered into any Contract, or authorized, committed
or agreed to enter into any Contract, pursuant to which (a) any stockholder of
the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount
or nature than the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of its Shares or
pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote to adopt this
Agreement or the Merger, or agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal, or
(b) any current employee of the Company has agreed to remain as an employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time.

 



31 4.10. _Brokers_. No broker, finder, financial advisor, investment banker or
other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or
other similar fee or commission or expense reimbursement in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made
by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for which the Company could have any
liability.

4.11. _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger
Sub in this Article IV, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person makes
any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or
Merger Sub or their respective businesses, assets, liabilities, condition
(financial or otherwise) or prospects, and Parent and Merger Sub hereby
disclaim any such other representations or warranties, including with respect
to any oral or written information furnished or made available to the Company,
its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates or Representatives in the course
of their negotiation of this Agreement or in the course of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, except for the representations and
warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in this Article IV.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, each
of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor
any other Person has made or is making any representations or warranties
relating to the Company whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly
given by the Company in Article III, including any implied representation or
warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the
Company furnished or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that no representations or warranties are
made with respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates, budgets or
prospect information that may have been made available to Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their Representatives.

Subsidiaries and Representatives shall have the right to (i) initiate,
solicit and encourage any inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, including by providing access to non-
public information to any Person pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement containing terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood that, notwithstanding the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement,
such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or amendment of
Acquisition Proposals) or, to the extent applicable, pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
(any such confidentiality agreement, an " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ "); _provided_ that the Company shall promptly make available to
Parent and Merger Sub any non-public information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access that was not
previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub and (ii) engage in, enter
into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
with any Persons or groups of Persons with respect to any Acquisition
Proposals and cooperate with or assist or participate in or facilitate any
such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations or any effort or
attempt to make any Acquisition Proposals. The parties hereto agree that,
notwithstanding the occurrence of the No Shop Period Start Date, the Company
may continue to engage in the activities described in

 



36  clause (ii) above with respect to each Excluded Party until 15 days after
the No Shop Period Start Date (the " _Cut-off Date_ "). No later than two
Business Days after the No Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall provide
Parent in writing a complete list of all Excluded Parties (including the
identity of each Excluded Party) and shall provide to Parent (i) an unredacted
copy of any Acquisition Proposal made in writing provided to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (including any financing commitments relating thereto,
which shall include any fee letters (it being understood that any such fee
letter may be redacted to omit the numerical amounts provided therein)) and
(ii) a written summary of the material terms of any Acquisition Proposal not
made in writing (including any financing commitments and any fee letters
relating thereto (it being understood that any such fee letter may
be redacted to omit the numerical amounts provided therein)).

(b) Except as may relate to any Excluded Party until the Cut-off Date or as
expressly permitted by this Section 5.2, from the No Shop Period Start Date
until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article VII, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not,
and the Company shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives not to, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any
inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to, or provide
any non-public information or data concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person relating to, an Acquisition Proposal or afford to
any Person access to the business, properties, assets or personnel of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) enter into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar
definitive agreement, or any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or
agreement in principle, or any other agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement as permitted pursuant to Section 5.2(c)) relating
to an Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), (iv)
grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill or confidentiality
agreement or any Takeover Statute, or (v) otherwise knowingly facilitate any
such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations or any effort or
attempt by any Person to make an Acquisition Proposal. Except as may relate to
any Excluded Party until the Cut-off Date or as expressly permitted by this
Section 5.2, from and after the No Shop Period Start Date, the Company and its
officers and directors shall, and the Company shall instruct and cause the
Companys Representatives, its Subsidiaries and their Representatives to,
immediately cease and terminate all discussions and negotiations with any
Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, and as
promptly as practicable thereafter deliver a written notice to each such
Person to the effect that the Company is ending all discussions and
negotiations with such Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
effective immediately, which notice shall also request such Person to promptly
return or destroy all confidential information

 



37  concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company shall take all
reasonable necessary actions to secure its rights and ensure the performance
of any such Persons obligations under any applicable confidentiality
agreement (including enforcement of any applicable "standstill" provision).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(b), at
any time following the No Shop Period Start Date and prior to the time the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the Company receives a bona fide,
written Acquisition Proposal from any Person, (i) the Company and its
Representatives may provide information (including non-public information and
data) regarding, and afford access to, the business, properties, assets,
books, records and personnel of, the Company and its Subsidiaries in response
to a request therefor by such Person if the Company receives from such Person
(or has received from such Person) an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and (ii) the Company and its Representatives may engage in, enter
into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
with such Person with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the
extent that prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above,
(x) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that (A) failure to take such action would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to
stockholders under applicable Law and (B) based on the information then
available and after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal and (y) the Company shall give written notice to Parent of any such
determination by the Company Board. The Company shall promptly provide Parent
with copies of any information or materials regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other Person which were not
previously made available to Parent.

(d) Except as set forth in this Section 5.2(d), the Company Board shall not
(i) change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or
resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger or fail to
include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any of the
foregoing, a " _Change of Recommendation_ "), (ii) authorize, adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or propose to authorize, adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise), an Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, the Company Board may (x) if an event, fact, development or
occurrence that affects the business, assets or operations of the Company
that is unknown to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement becomes
known to the Company Board (an " _Intervening Event_ "), effect a 

 



38  Change of Recommendation or (y) if the Company receives a written
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
constitutes a Superior Proposal, approve, recommend or declare advisable, and
authorize the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to, such Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.3(a) if, in the case of either of clause (x) or (y):

(i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law
and the Company shall have complied with all of its obligations under this
Section 5.2;

(ii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance, that it intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(a), which
notice shall specify the basis for the Change of Recommendation or
termination and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, the identity of the
party making such Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof and include
copies of all relevant documents relating to such Superior Proposal;

 

(iii) after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Change of
Recommendation or terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(a), the
Company shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to, negotiate
with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith during such four Business Day period
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Company Board not
to effect a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.3(a); and

 

(iv) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement offered in writing by Parent no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the fourth Business Day of such four Business Day period and shall
have determined (x) in the event the Company Boards determination pursuant to
clause (d)(i) above is in response to a Superior Proposal, that such Superior
Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes
offered in writing by Parent were to be given effect; _provided_ that, in the
event of any material revisions to the Acquisition Proposal that the Company
Board has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required
to deliver a new written notice to Parent in respect of such modified
Acquisition Proposal and to again comply with the requirements of
this Section 5.2(d) with respect to such new written

 



39  notice, except that the applicable time periods for purposes of this Section
5.2(d) with respect to such new written notice shall be reduced to two
Business Days from the four Business Day period otherwise contemplated or (y)
in the event the Company Boards determination pursuant to clause (d)(i) above
is in response to an Intervening Event, that such changes would not affect the
Companys Board determination of the need for a Change of Recommendation in
response to such Intervening Event.

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from (i) complying with
its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop-look-
and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
stockholders of the Company); _provided_ that any such disclosure (other than
a "stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed for all
purposes of this Agreement to be a Change of Recommendation unless the Company
Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Recommendation within four
Business Days following any request by Parent (it being agreed that Parent
may make only one such request with respect to any single such disclosure).

(f) From and after the No Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall promptly
(and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent (orally and in writing) if
any Acquisition Proposal is received by or any non-public information is
requested from the Company or any of its Representatives, indicating the
identity of the Person or group of Persons making such offer or proposal and
the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if
applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements), and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on
a reasonably current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or
offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any discussions
or negotiations, including any change in the Companys intentions as
previously notified.

(g) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any Person relating to a possible
Acquisition Proposal subsequent to the date of this Agreement except for an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement as permitted or required pursuant to this
Section 5.2, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter
into any agreement that prohibits the Company from providing to Parent any
information provided or made available to any other Person pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(h) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this Section 5.2 by any Representatives of the Company shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.2 by the Company.

 



40 5.3. _Proxy Statement; Schedule 13E-3._

 

(a) As promptly as practicable and in any event within fifteen Business Days
after the date hereof, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a
preliminary proxy statement relating to the Stockholders Meeting (together
with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ")
and the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and file the Schedule 13E-3
and the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate with each other in
connection with the preparation of the foregoing. The Company agrees that,
assuming Parents compliance with the last sentence of this Section 5.3(a),
the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 (i) will comply in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and (ii) will not, with respect to the Proxy
Statement, on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and
at the time of the Stockholders Meeting and, with respect to the Schedule
13E-3, the date it is first filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to information
supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger
Sub shall cooperate with the Company in connection with the preparation and
filing of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3, including promptly
furnishing to the Company in writing upon reasonable request any information
relating to it as may be required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement or
Schedule 13E-3 under applicable Law. Parent shall ensure that such information
supplied by it in writing for inclusion (or incorporation by reference) in
the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 will not, on the date it is first
mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting or filed with the SEC (as applicable), contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 and of any
request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional
information and shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence
between the Company or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to
the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3. The Company and Parent shall each
use its reasonable best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with
respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3
from the SEC and to make any amendments or filings as may be necessary in
connection therewith. The Company shall cause the

 



41  definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed promptly after the date the SEC
staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may
commence mailing the Proxy Statement; provided that the Company shall not be
required to mail the Proxy Statement prior to the No Shop Period Start Date.

(c) Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall cooperate and provide Parent
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the draft of the Proxy
Statement (including each amendment or supplement thereto), and the parties
hereto shall cooperate and provide each other with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the draft Schedule 13E-3 (including each amendment or
supplement thereto) and all responses to requests for additional information
by and replies to comments of the SEC, prior to filing such with or sending
such to the SEC, and the parties hereto will provide each other with copies of
all such filings made and correspondence with the SEC.

 

5.4. _Stockholders Meeting_.

(a) The Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its
certificate of incorporation and by-laws, all reasonable action necessary to
convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ")
within 35 days after the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement to consider
and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement; _provided_ that the Company may
postpone or adjourn to a later date the Stockholders Meeting (i) with the
consent of Parent, (ii) for the absence of a quorum, or (iii) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or
amended disclosure that the Company has determined in good faith is necessary
under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior to the
Stockholders Meeting.

 

(b) The Company shall postpone or adjourn to a later date the Stockholders
Meeting on one occasion at the request of Parent. Subject to the right of the
Company Board to make a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section
5.2(d), the Company Board shall recommend adoption of this Agreement by its
stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting and shall take all reasonable lawful
action to solicit such adoption of this Agreement.

(c) The Company shall establish a record date for purposes of determining
stockholders entitled to notice of and vote at the Stockholders Meeting (the "
_Record Date_ ") that is approximately 35 days prior to the date of the
Stockholders Meeting. Once the Company has established the Record Date, the
Company shall not change such Record Date or establish a different record date
for the Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent,
unless required to do so by applicable Law or the Companys bylaws. In the
event that the date of the Stockholders Meeting as originally called is for
any reason adjourned or postponed or

 



42  otherwise delayed, the Company agrees that unless Parent shall have
otherwise approved in writing, it shall implement such adjournment or
postponement or other delay in such a way that the Company does not establish
a new Record Date for the Stockholders Meeting, as so adjourned, postponed or
delayed, except as required by applicable Law or the Companys bylaws. Without
the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement shall be
the only matter (other than procedural matters) that the Company shall propose
to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Stockholders Meeting.

 

5.5. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Filings; Other Actions_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and
without limiting any express obligations of the parties hereunder, each party
hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, all obligations of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub to obtain the Financing or any other financing for the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed exclusively by
Sections 5.12 and 5.13, and not this Section 5.5. Without limiting the
foregoing, promptly following the execution of this Agreement, each party
hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to make all registrations,
filings, notifications and submissions

(i) that are required to be submitted to the Defense Security Service of the
United States Department of Defense or any other United States Cognizant
Security Agency in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in accordance with Paragraph 2-302(b) of the NISPOM; and

 

(ii) that are required to be submitted to the United Stated Department of
State Directorate of Defense Trade Controls in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the ITAR.

(b) The Company shall, and Parent and Merger Sub shall (or shall cause their
respective Affiliates, if applicable, to), file with the Department of Justice
and the Federal Trade Commission a Pre-Merger Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act in respect of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and duly make all notifications and other filings required
under any other Regulatory Law in respect of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, and each party will use its reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions necessary, including to
comply promptly and fully with any requests for information from regulatory
Governmental Entities, to obtain any clearance, waiver, approval or
authorization, or expiration or termination of

 



43  the applicable waiting periods relating to the HSR Act or other applicable
Regulatory Law that is necessary to enable the parties to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect
to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby under any
Regulatory Law. If any Action, including any Action by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Regulatory Law,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate in all respects and
use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such
Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other Order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including by pursuing all reasonable avenues of administrative and judicial
appeal.

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) subject to any
restrictions under any Regulatory Law, to the extent practicable, promptly
notify each other of any communication to that party from any Governmental
Entity (including the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice) with respect to this Agreement and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and permit the other party to
review in advance any proposed written communication to any Governmental
Entity in respect thereof, (ii) unless required by applicable Law, not agree
to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect to this Agreement and
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults
with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat, in each case to the extent practicable, (iii) subject to
any restrictions under any Regulatory Law, furnish the other party with copies
of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth
the substance thereof) between it and its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of its
staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (excluding documents and
communications which are subject to preexisting confidentiality agreements or
to the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine), and (iv) furnish
the other party with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
such other party and its Affiliates may reasonably request in connection with
their preparation of necessary filings, registrations or submissions of
information to any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including without
limitation any filings necessary or appropriate under the provisions of any
Regulatory Law.

 



44 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and
Merger Sub shall take any and all action necessary, including but not limited
to (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to
sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of
the Company or its Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating existing relationships,
contractual rights or obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries; (iii)
terminating any venture or other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship,
contractual rights or obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (v)
effectuating any other change or restructuring of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to the
entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications with any
Governmental Entity in connection with any of the foregoing, and by consenting
to such action by the Company, _provided_ , in each case, that any such action
shall be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger) (each a " _Divestiture
Action_ ") to ensure that no Governmental Entity enters any order, decision,
judgment, decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or
establishes any law, rule, regulation or other action preliminarily or
permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger, or to ensure that no Governmental Entity with the authority to clear,
authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the Merger, fails to do so
by the Termination Date. In the event that any action is threatened or
instituted challenging the Merger as violative of any pre-merger notification
requirement or other Regulatory Law, Parent shall take all action necessary,
including but not limited to any Divestiture Action, to avoid or resolve such
action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.5, in no
event shall this Section 5.5 require Parent or Merger Sub to take any action,
including any Divestiture Action, that would reasonably be expected to result
in a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, properties,
assets or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

 

(f) If any Divestiture Action agreed to by Parent requires action by or with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their respective
businesses or assets, and such action would constitute a breach of this
Agreement, Parent hereby agrees to consent to the taking of such action by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and any such action may, at the discretion
of the Company, be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.

(g) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if applicable, the
Company shall cooperate with and provide reasonable assistance to Parent in
Parents efforts to obtain from DSS approval to operate the business of the
Company from and after the Closing pursuant to a FOCI mitigation
arrangement in accordance with the NISPOM.

(h) The Company shall cooperate and provide such reasonable assistance to
Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate and provide
such reasonable assistance to the Company, as may be reasonably required in
the event that

 



45  any Governmental Entity requires a novation of any Government Contract. To
the extent any Government Contract or Government Bid requires notification to
a Governmental Entity with respect to the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make all such notifications
as promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement.

5.6. _Access and Reports_.

(a) Subject to applicable Law and, with respect to any classified or
controlled unclassified materials, to the compliance by Parent, Merger Sub and
each of their respective Representatives with any security clearance
requirements and procedures or export controls requirements (to the extent
determined necessary or advisable by the Company in order to comply with
applicable Law), from and after the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, (i) afford to Parent, Merger Sub and each of their respective
Representatives, reasonable access, during normal business hours, to its
personnel, offices and other facilities, properties, books, contracts and
records and (ii) furnish or cause to be furnished such information concerning
the business, properties, assets, liabilities and personnel of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives
may reasonably request; provided that the foregoing shall not require the
Company to provide access or information if such action would, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) violate any Contract or any
obligation or agreement with respect to confidentiality or nondisclosure owing
to any third-party (including any Governmental Entity) so long as the Company
shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such
third party to such inspection or disclosure, (ii) constitute a waiver of the
attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries if the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to
disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege or
(iii) to the extent such information relates to individual performance or
personnel evaluation records, medical histories or other personnel
information, subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to potential
material liability (provided that the parties shall cooperate in seeking a
manner of disclosure of such information that would not reasonably be expected
to result in potential material liability to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries). Any access to the properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries granted pursuant to this Section 5.6(a) shall be subject to the
Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements, and shall
not include the right to perform any invasive testing.

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be

 



46  required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to
obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, (ii) of any Action commenced or, to such partys
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with, arising from or relating to
this Agreement or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby ("
_Transaction Litigation_ ") and (iii) if such party becomes aware of any facts
or circumstances that such party believes do, or with the passage of time are
reasonably likely to, constitute a breach of this Agreement by such party or
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to
the obligations of the other party hereto to effect the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied;
provided that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of any party to effect the Merger under this Agreement.

5.7.  _Publicity_.

(a) The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a joint press
release by the Company and Parent and thereafter (unless the Company Board
shall have effected a Change of Recommendation or in connection with Section
5.2(e), in which case the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7 shall not
be applicable) the Company and Parent each shall consult with the other prior
to issuing, and to the extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances
give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press releases
or otherwise making any public announcements with respect to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to
making any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
(including any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service)
with respect thereto, except that the limitations of this Section 5.7 shall
not be applicable where such public announcements or filings are (a) required
by Law or by applicable obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service,
or (b) made at the request of any Governmental Entity.

 

(b) Upon Parents request, ( _i_ ) the Company and Parent shall cooperate to
prepare, promptly following such request, a joint written presentation
reasonably acceptable to both parties to Institutional Shareholder Services
Inc. (and such other proxy voting advisory services reasonably requested by
Parent) recommending this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, and ( _ii_ ) the Company shall request a meeting with
each such proxy voting advisory service for purposes of obtaining its
recommendation of the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys
stockholders. 

 



47 5.8. _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For a period of not less than one year following the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall provide each individual who is a current employee
of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (including any current employee who
is not actively at work on account of illness, disability or leave of absence)
on the Closing Date (the " _Affected Employees_ "), while employed by the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, with compensation and
benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the compensation and
benefits provided to such Affected Employee as of the date of this Agreement
(other than ( _i_ ) equity compensation incentives, ( _ii_ ) any compensation
or benefits triggered in whole or in part by the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and ( _iii_ ) cash
incentives in respect of the Companys fiscal year beginning on July 1,
2012). Nothing contained in this Section 5.8 shall be deemed to grant any
Affected Employee any right to continued employment after the Closing Date.

 

(b) Parent will cause any employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) in
which the Affected Employees are entitled to participate after the Closing
Date to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and, under any
plan providing severance benefits or paid time off, level of benefits,
service by such employees as if such service were with Parent or its
Subsidiaries, to the same extent such service was credited under a comparable
Plan (except to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits).

 

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plans maintained by Parent and its
Subsidiaries for the benefit of the Affected Employees following the Closing
Date (" _New Plans_ "), Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to (i) cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements or
pre-existing condition limitations or waiting period requirements to the same
extent waived under comparable Plans prior to the time coverage under the New
Plans commences and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible, co-
insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, amounts paid by
such employees during the year in which coverage under the New Plans
commences under comparable Plans.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and any successor thereto to assume, honor, fulfill and discharge
the Companys and its Subsidiaries obligations under the agreements or
arrangements set forth on Schedule 5.8(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
in accordance with the terms of such agreements or arrangements.

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.8, whether express or implied, (i)
shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement or (ii) is intended to confer upon any Person
(including any current or

 



48  former employee, director or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) any rights as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

 

5.9. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense, without regard to whether the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of
the Paying Agent, in connection with the transactions contemplated in Article
II.

5.10. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation agrees that
it will indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law (and advance costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law to), each
present and former director and officer of the Company (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified Parties service
as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or services
performed by such persons at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, in connection with (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) actions to enforce this provision or any other indemnification or
advancement right of any Indemnified Party.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) the
directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys
existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of no less than six years from and after the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as those provided under the
Companys existing policies in effect on the date hereof with respect to any
actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission,
neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such
capacity that existed or 

 



49  occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the
Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to
maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO
Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (x) in no event shall the Company or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for any such policies pursuant to this Section 5.10(b) an
annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid
by the Company for such insurance, and (y) if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall
(i) consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.10.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 5.10 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws or comparable governing documents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. All
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to

Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreement
between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any
such Indemnified Party.

 



50 5.11. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such
steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain
No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such
matters.

 

5.12. _Financing_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or
any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Financing Letters or the
Rollover Letter, if such amendment, modification or waiver would, or would
reasonably be expected to, (i) (A) with respect to the Financing Letters,
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing (unless the Rollover Investment
is increased by a corresponding amount) or (B) with respect to the Rollover
Letter, reduce the amount of Shares to be contributed (unless the Financing is
increased by a corresponding amount), or (ii) impose new or
additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expand, amend or modify any
of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing or the contribution
contemplated by the Rollover Letter or other terms in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (x) materially delay or prevent the Closing Date or
(y) make the timely funding of the Financing or the contribution contemplated
by the Rollover Letter, or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Financing or the contribution contemplated by the Rollover Letter, materially
less likely to occur. Any reference in this Agreement to (i) "Financing" shall
include the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as amended or
modified in compliance with this Section 5.12, (ii) the "Rollover Investment"
shall include the financing contemplated by the Rollover Letter as amended or
modified in compliance with this Section 5.12 and (iii) "Financing
Letters", "Rollover Letter" or "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such
documents as amended or modified in compliance with this Section 5.12(a).

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper and advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) described in the Financing Letters
and any related Fee Letter, (provided that Parent and Merger Sub may
amend, replace or modify the Debt Commitment Letters and any related Fee
Letter to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities or (y) otherwise amend, replace or modify, or
consent to any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment
Letters so long as such action would not violate this Section 5.12) and the
contribution contemplated by the Rollover Letter pursuant to the terms
thereof, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in

 



51  effect the Financing Letters and the Rollover Letter in accordance with the
terms and subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) negotiate, execute and
deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letters on the terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and related Fee
Letters, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding that are
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letters and such
definitive agreements thereto and in the Equity Commitment Letter and the
Rollover Letter, and to consummate the Financing and make the Rollover
Investment at or prior to the Closing, including using its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Financing Sources to fund the Financing and the Rollover
Stockholder to make the Rollover Investment at the Closing, (iv) comply with
its obligations under the Financing Letters and the Rollover Letter, and (v)
enforce their respective rights under the Financing Letters and the Rollover
Letter. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis
and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing and provide to the Company copies of all executed definitive
documents related to the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice (
_x_ ) of any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give
rise to any breach or default) by any party to the Rollover Letter, any
Financing Letters or definitive document related to the Financing of which
Parent and Merger Sub become aware, ( _y_ ) of the receipt by Parent or Merger
Sub of any written notice or other written communication from any
Financing source with respect to any ( _A_ ) breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Rollover Letter, any Financing Letters or any
definitive document related to the Financing of any provisions of the
Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing or (
_B_ ) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Financing Letters, Rollover Letter or any definitive document related to the
Financing and (z) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good
faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
or the Rollover Investment on the terms, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Financing Letters, the Rollover Letter or the definitive
documents related to the Financing.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, if any portion of
the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources on terms and conditions not less favorable in the aggregate to Parent
and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and the
related Fee Letter and in an amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or
such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the " _Alternate Debt
Financing_ "), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter with respect to
such Alternate Debt Financing (the " _New Debt Commitment Letters_ "), which
shall replace the existing Debt Commitment Letters

 



52  in whole or in part, a copy of which shall be promptly provided to the
Company. In the event any New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, ( _i_ )
any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" or the "Debt Financing"
shall mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as
modified pursuant to clause (ii) below and ( _ii_ ) any reference in this
Agreement to the "Financing Letters" or the "Debt Commitment Letters" shall
be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters to the extent not superseded
by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New Debt
Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Section 5.12 shall require, and in no event shall
the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to
require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) bring any enforcement action
against any source of the Equity Financing to enforce its respective rights
under the Equity Commitment Letter or against the Rollover Stockholder to
enforce its rights under the Rollover Letter except that Parent shall seek to
enforce, including by bringing suit for specific performance, the Equity
Commitment Letter and the Rollover Letter if and only if the Company seeks and
is granted a decree of specific performance of the obligation to consummate
the Merger after all conditions to the granting thereof set forth in Section
8.7(b) have been satisfied, (ii) seek the Equity Financing or the Rollover
Investment from any source other than those counterparty to, or in any amount
in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter or
the Rollover Letter, as applicable, or (iii) pay any fees in excess of those
contemplated by the Financing Letters (whether to secure waiver of any
conditions contained therein or otherwise).

 

(e) Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing or the Rollover Investment is not a condition to Closing. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Financing or the Rollover Investment has not been
obtained, Parent and Merger Sub shall each continue to be obligated, subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI,
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees
that in the event the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not consummated, the Companys sole and exclusive remedies are
those set forth in Sections 7.5 and 8.7.

5.13. _Financing Cooperation_.

8.7. _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that,
prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, the
parties shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, except as provided in Section
8.7(b).

 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 8.7(a), it is expressly agreed that the Company
shall be entitled to seek specific performance of Parents obligation
pursuant to the terms

 



69  of this Agreement to cause the Rollover Investment to be made and the Equity
Financing to be funded to fund the Merger and to consummate the Merger in the
event that (i) all of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which is capable of being
satisfied at the Closing), (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be
funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and the
Rollover Investment is made at Closing, (iii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to
complete the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2 and (iv) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded
and the Rollover Investment is made, then the Closing will occur. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or
seek to enforce specifically Parents obligation to cause the Rollover
Investment to be made and the Equity Financing to be funded or to
complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be
funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and the
Rollover Investment is made at the Closing).

 

(c) Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly available
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that (i) there is
adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement when
expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

 

8.8. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto), the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Limited Guarantee and the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated as of May 18, 2010, between Providence Equity Partners LLC

Agreement_ ") constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written and
oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

8.9. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except (i) for the rights under Article
II on and after the Effective Time of the holders of Shares, Company Options
and Company Restricted Stock Awards to receive payments therefor and (ii) as
provided in Section 5.10, 5.13(e), 7.5 and 8.5 (each of which provisions is
intended to be for the benefit of the Persons referred to therein, and may be
enforced by any such Person), each of Parent and the Company hereby agree that
their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein
are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and

 



70  subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended
to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further
agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 5.10 shall
not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance with Section 8.3 without notice or liability to any other
Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Financing Source (and its
Representatives) shall be express third party beneficiaries with respect to
Sections 7.5(a),7.5(e) and 8.5.

8.10. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. 

8.11. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
