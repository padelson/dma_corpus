2.1 _Board Composition_

  



  

(a) _Resignations_. Concurrently with the consummation of the
Inspired Transaction, each member of the Board of Directors of the Company
(the " _Board_ ") who is not identified in _Section 2.1(c)_ below (the "
_Resigning Directors_ ") shall resign from the Board, effective immediately,
and immediately upon such resignations, the Board shall fill the
resulting vacancies so that the Board will consist of only the individuals
identified in _Section 2.1(c)_ below until such individual's earlier
resignation, death or removal.

  



  

(b) _Generally_. Following consummation of the Inspired
Transaction, the Board shall initially be comprised of seven (7) directors
(each a " _Director_ " and collectively the " _Directors_ ") designated by
the Stockholders as follows:

  



  

(i) Three (3) Directors designated by Vitruvian (on behalf of the
Vitruvian Group) (the " _Vitruvian Designees_ "); _provided_ , that (A) the
number of Vitruvian Designees to be designated by Vitruvian shall be
reduced to two (2) Directors at such time as the Vitruvian Group holds less
than thirty percent (30%) but at least fifteen percent (15%) or more of all
Shares, (B) the number of Vitruvian Designees to be designated by Vitruvian
shall be reduced to one (1) Director at such time as the Vitruvian Group
holds less than fifteen percent (15%) but at least five percent (5%) or more
of all Shares, and (C) Vitruvian shall have no right to designate any
Director pursuant to this _Section 2.1(b)(i)_ at such time as the
Vitruvian Group in the aggregate holds less than five percent (5%) of all
Shares. At least two out of three Vitruvian Designees, or one out of two
Vitruvian Designees, must satisfy the Independence Qualification; for the
avoidance of doubt, if the Vitruvian Group is only entitled to one Vitruvian
Designee, such Vitruvian Designee shall not be required to satisfy the
Independence Qualification.

  



  

(ii) One (1) Director who shall be the then-current Chief Executive
Officer of the Company (the " _Chief Executive Officer Designee_ ") for so
long as such person is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

  



  

(iii) One (1) Director designated by the Hydra Sponsor (on behalf of
the Hydra Sponsor Group) (the " _Hydra Sponsor Designee_ ");  _provided_ ,
that the Hydra Sponsor shall have no right to designate any Director pursuant

aggregate holds less than five percent (5%) of all Shares.

  



    

 5

 



    



  

(iv) The remaining two (2) Directors designated jointly by MIHI and
the Hydra Sponsor (the " _MIHI/HS Designees_ "); _provided_ , that MIHI and
the Hydra Sponsor shall have no right to designate the MIHI/HS Designees
pursuant to this _Section 2.1(b)(iv)_  at such time as MIHI and the Hydra
Sponsor in the aggregate hold less than five percent (5%) of all Shares.
MIHI/HS Designees must satisfy the Independence Qualification to the extent
necessary to ensure that (provided that Vitruvian Designees satisfy the
Independence Qualification to the extent required by _Section 2.1(b)(i))_ a
majority of all Directors satisfy the Independence Qualification.

  



  

In the event of any increase in the size of the Board, vacancies so created
shall be filled in proportion to the designation rights set forth above (with
any number of directors ending in a fraction of one-half (1/2) or greater
being rounded up to the next whole number of directors).

  



  

(c) _Initial Directors_. The initial Vitruvian Designees pursuant
to the provisions of _Section 2.1(b)(i)_ shall be Nicholas Hagen, Philip
Russmeyer and John Vandemore. The initial Chief Executive Officer Designee
shall be Luke Alvarez. The initial Hydra Sponsor Designee pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 2.1(b)(iii)_ shall be A. Lorne Weil. The initial
MIHI/HS Designees pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.1(b)(iv)_ shall be
Ira Raphaelson and Roger Withers.

  



  

(d) _Requirements_. The Company shall, at any annual or special

subject to the fulfillment of the requirements set forth in this _Section
2.1(d)_ , nominate the Stockholder Designees for election to the Board and
use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Stockholder Designees to
be elected as Directors of the Board. Any Stockholder Designee shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee (the " _Governance Committee_ "). The Company shall require that
all Directors comply in all respects with applicable law (including with
respect to confidentiality) and the Company's corporate governance guidelines,
code of business conduct and ethics and confidentiality and trading policies
and guidelines as in effect from time to time. Each Stockholder shall
notify the Company of any proposed Stockholder Designee in writing no later
than the latest date on which stockholders of the Company may make
nominations to the Board in accordance with the Bylaws of the Company (the "
_Bylaws_ "), together with all information concerning such nominee required
to be delivered to the Company by the Bylaws and such other information
reasonably requested by the Company; _provided_ that in each such case, all
such information is generally required to be delivered to the Company by the
other outside Directors of the Company.

(e) _Removal; Vacancies_. No Director may be removed from the Board
(for any reason) except at the written direction of the Stockholder
or Stockholders entitled to designate such Director, which Stockholder will
thereupon be entitled to designate an alternative Director to fill the
vacancy; _provided_ , _however_ , that at least 50% of the Directors
(excluding the Director subject to potential removal) may (i) remove a
Director for Cause and (ii) remove the Chief Executive Officer Designee at any
time when such Person is no longer serving as the Chief Executive Officer of
the Company and elect the then-current Chief Executive Officer of the
Company as the new Chief Executive Officer Designee. A Director may resign at
any time, such resignation to be made in writing and to take effect
immediately or on such later date as may be specified therein. In the event of
any vacancy in the Board, whether created by the removal, resignation, death,
disability or retirement of a Director or otherwise, the Board shall promptly
elect to the Board a replacement Director designated by the Stockholder or
Stockholders entitled to designate such Director in accordance with  _Section
2.1(b)_ , subject to the fulfillment of the requirements set forth in _Section
2.1(d)_. If the number of Directors that a Stockholder has the right to
designate to the Board is decreased pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ , then such
Stockholder shall designate one of more of such Stockholder's Designees to
resign, or be removed, from the Board.

  



  

(f) _Committee Membership_. Subject to applicable law and the
listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market (or other United States
national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed, if any) and
applicable law, the Company will offer the Stockholder Designees an
opportunity to sit on each regular committee of the Board in relative
proportion to the number of Stockholder Designees on the Board. If a
Stockholder Designee fails to satisfy the applicable qualifications under law
or stock exchange listing standard to sit on any committee of the Board, then
the Board shall offer such Stockholder Designee the opportunity to attend (but
not vote) at the meetings of such committee as an observer.

  



  

(g) _Observer Rights_. MIHI, for so long as it holds at least five
percent (5%) of all Shares, shall be entitled to designate one (1)
person (the " _Observer_ ") to attend, as a non-voting observer, all meetings
(including telephonic meetings) of the Board and any committees thereof;
provided, that, if MIHI ceases to hold at least five percent (5%) of all
Shares, MIHI shall no longer have the right to designate an Observer. The
Observer shall be obligated to comply with any confidentiality provisions
generally applicable to Directors from time to time. The Company shall give
the Observer notice of such meetings, by telecopy or by such other means as
such notices are delivered to Directors, not later than the same time notice
is provided or delivered to the Directors;  _provided_ , that a majority of
the Board (or a majority of any committee thereof) may exclude the Observer
from any meeting of the Board (or of such committee) or any portion thereof
in the event that a majority of the Board (or of such committee)
reasonably believes that such exclusion is reasonably necessary to preserve
the attorney-client privilege, to protect confidential information or to
comply with law. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
materials that are sent to the Directors in their capacity as such, whether
or not in connection with a meeting of the Board, including copies of all
minutes, consents, correspondence and other material, shall be sent to the
Observer simultaneously by the Company by means reasonably designed to insure
timely receipt by the Observer; _provided_ , that the Company may exclude
from the materials sent to the Observer any materials that the
Company reasonably believes are or may be subject to the attorney-client
privilege or to protect confidential information. So long as MIHI is entitled
to designate an Observer, MIHI shall be entitled to remove or replace an
existing Observer or designate a new Observer, as applicable, with or without
cause at any time by sending a written notice to the Company. MIHI may also
elect to leave its Observer position vacant and decline its right to receive
a copy of all such materials and information for so long as it shall so
specify in writing to the Company. Except as is reasonably necessary to
preserve the attorney-client privilege, to protect confidential information
or to comply with law, the Observer shall have the right to share all
materials and information received by the Observer with the MIHI Group,
subject to the same confidentiality provisions generally applicable to
Directors from time to time.

designated jointly by MIHI and the Hydra Sponsor present, for so long as
Vitruvian or MIHI and the Hydra Sponsor jointly (as the case may be) have the
right to designate one (1) or more Directors in accordance with _Section
2.1(b)_ ) shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business at any meeting of the Board. If there is less than a
quorum at any meeting of the Board, such Directors present at the meeting
shall adjourn the meeting from time to time and shall cause notice of
such adjournment to be delivered to all of the Directors who were absent from
the adjourned meeting.

  



  

(b) _Voting_. On all matters requiring the vote or action of the
Board, each Director shall be entitled to one (1) vote and, except as

entitled to reimbursement from the Company for his or her reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses (including travel, lodging and other related expenses)
incurred by such Director in attending any meeting of the Board (or committee
thereof). Reimbursement of such expenses shall be made by the Company in
accordance with and in compliance with the Company's expense reimbursement
policies. For so long as the Company maintains directors and officers
liability insurance, the Company shall include each Stockholder Designee as
an "insured" for all purposes under such insurance policy for so long as such
Stockholder Designee is a Director of the Company and for the same period as
for other former Directors of the Company when such Stockholder Designee
ceases to be a Director of the Company.

  



  

2.3 _Voting Agreement as to Certain Matters_. Each Stockholder
agrees, in person or by proxy, to cause all of its shares of Company

Business; _provided_ , that any transactions between the Company and/or the
Company's Subsidiaries and an Other Business will be on terms no less

_further_ , that no Vitruvian Designee may serve on the board of directors or
other governing body or committee of any such Other Business without the prior

delivered by mail in the manner and to the address provided in this section or
as set forth on  _Exhibit A_ , be deemed given on the earlier of the fourth
Business Day following mailing or upon receipt, and (iv) if delivered by
overnight courier in the manner and to the address provided in this section or
as set forth on _Exhibit A_ , be deemed given on the earlier of receipt or

5.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Transaction
Agreements constitute the entire agreement among the Stockholders relating
to matters contemplated hereby, and supersede all prior Contracts with
respect to the matters contemplated hereby and thereby.

  



  

5.3 _Effect of Waiver or Consent_. A waiver or consent, express or
implied, of or to any breach or default by any Person in the performance by
that Person of its obligations hereunder or with respect to the Company is not
a consent or waiver to or of any other breach or default in the performance
by that Person of the same or any other obligations of that Person hereunder
or with respect to the Company. Failure on the part of a Person to complain
of any act of any Person or to declare any Person in default hereunder or
with respect to the Company, irrespective of how long that failure continues,
does not constitute a waiver by that Person of its rights with respect to
that default until the applicable statute-of-limitations period has run.

5.4 _Amendment or Modification_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented, and any provision hereof may be waived, from
time to time only if approved by all of the Stockholders and the Company.

  



  

5.5 _Binding Effect_. Subject to the restrictions on Transfers set
forth in this Agreement, this Agreement is binding on and shall inure to the
benefit of the Stockholders and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. The terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for
the benefit of each Party hereto and their respective successors or permitted
assigns and it is not the intention of the Parties to confer third-party
beneficiary rights upon any other.

  



  

5.6 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under applicable law or rule
in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or any other jurisdiction, but this Agreement
shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.

  



  

5.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to the principles of conflicts of law (whether of the State of
Delaware or otherwise) that would result in the application of the laws of
any other jurisdiction. In the event of a direct conflict between the
provisions of this Agreement and any provision of the certificate of
incorporation of the Company (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ ") or any
mandatory provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the applicable
provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or the Delaware
General Corporation Law shall control. In the event of a conflict between the
provisions of this Agreement and any provision of the Bylaws of the Company,
the provisions of this Agreement shall control except to the extent, if any,
prohibited by applicable law. Each of the parties covenants and agrees to
vote their shares of the Company's capital stock and to take any other action
reasonably requested by the Company or any Stockholder to amend the Company's
Bylaws so as to avoid any conflict with the provisions hereof.

AND IRREVOCABLE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF THE AFORESAID COURTS AND WAIVES ANY
DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ANY
NON-APPEALABLE JUDGMENT RENDERED THEREBY IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACTIONS OR
PROCEEDINGS. A COPY OF ANY SERVICE OF PROCESS SERVED UPON THE PARTIES SHALL BE
MAILED BY REGISTERED MAIL TO THE RESPECTIVE PARTY EXCEPT THAT, UNLESS
OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY FAILURE TO MAIL SUCH COPY SHALL
NOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF SERVICE OF PROCESS. IF ANY AGENT APPOINTED BY A
PARTY REFUSES TO ACCEPT SERVICE, EACH PARTY AGREES THAT SERVICE UPON THE
APPROPRIATE PARTY BY REGISTERED MAIL SHALL CONSTITUTE SUFFICIENT SERVICE.
NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF A PARTY TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY
OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW.

5.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY

PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO A
BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THAT EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THE WAIVER IN ENTERING
INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT EACH WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE WAIVER
IN THEIR RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS. EACH PARTY FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS
THAT IT HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH

WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE
MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING, AND THE WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY
SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE

[5.10 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company
shall and does hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless each
Stockholder and each of their respective partners, stockholders, members,
directors, officers, fiduciaries, managers, controlling Persons, employees
and agents of each of the partners, stockholders, members, directors, officers
fiduciaries, managers, controlling Persons, employees and agents of each of
the foregoing (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against
any and all actions, causes of action, suits, claims, liabilities, losses,
damages and costs and other out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the
Indemnified Parties or any of them before or after the date of this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), arising out of any actual
or threatened action, cause of action, suit, or claim arising directly or
indirectly out of such Stockholder's or its other Indemnified Party's actual,
alleged or deemed control or ability to influence the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of such Stockholder's designation of Stockholder
Designee(s) pursuant to this Agreement, or the actual or alleged act
or omission of any Stockholders' Designee(s) (other than any such Indemnified
Liabilities that arise out of any breach of this Agreement by such
Indemnified Party or other related Persons); _provided_ that if and to the
extent that the foregoing undertaking may be unavailable or unenforceable for
any reason, the Company hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the
payment and satisfaction of each of the Indemnified Liabilities which is
permissible under applicable law. To the extent not prohibited by applicable
law, the Company shall pay the expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
incurred by an Indemnified Party in defending any action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a " _Proceeding_
"), in advance of its final disposition; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to
the extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of
the final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking by the Indemnified Party to repay all amounts advanced if it
should be ultimately determined that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to
be indemnified under this _Section 5.10(a)_ or otherwise. The rights of any
Indemnified Party to indemnification hereunder will be in addition to any
other rights any such Person may have under any other agreement or instruction
to which such Indemnified Party is or becomes a party or is or otherwise
becomes a beneficiary or under Law or regulation or under the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws or any of its Subsidiaries and shall extend to such
Indemnified Party's successors and assigns. Each of the Indemnified
Parties shall be a third party beneficiary of the rights conferred to such
Indemnified Party in this _Section 5.10(a)_.

  



  

(b) The Company hereby acknowledges that some of its Directors (the
" _Specified Directors_ ") may have certain rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and insurance provided by other entities and/or
organizations (collectively, the " _Fund Indemnitors_ "). The Company hereby
agrees and acknowledges (i) that it is the indemnitor of first resort with
respect to the Specified Directors (i.e., its obligations to the Specified
Directors are primary and any obligation of the Fund Indemnitors to advance
expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities
incurred by the Specified Directors are secondary), (ii) that it shall be
required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by the Specified
Directors and shall be liable for the full amount of all expenses, judgments,
penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the extent not
prohibited by (and not merely to the extent affirmatively permitted by)
applicable law and as required by this Agreement or the Certificate of
Incorporation or the Bylaws (or any other agreement between the Company and
the Specified Directors), without regard to any rights the Specified
Directors may have against the Fund Indemnitors and (iii) that it irrevocably
waives, relinquishes and releases the Fund Indemnitors from any and all
claims against the Fund Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other
recovery of any kind in respect thereof. The Company further agrees and
acknowledges that no advancement or payment by the Fund Indemnitors on behalf
of the Specified Directors with respect to any claim for which the Specified
Directors have sought indemnification from the Company shall affect the
foregoing and the Fund Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or
be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the
rights of recovery of the Specified Directors against the Company.

counterpart copies, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of
this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to
constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of copies of this
Agreement and of signature pages by electronic transmission shall constitute
