Agreement; and

Agreement, China Growth will acquire all of the outstanding capital shares

accordance with the BVIBCA. The Merger shall be effective at the time and on
the date of the registration of the Plan and Articles of Merger by the BVI

which shall occur on the Closing Date (the date and time the Merger becomes
effective being the " _Effective Time_ "), or at such other time(s) as

(b) the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease;

  



  

(c) each of the ordinary shares of the Company (" _Company Ordinary Shares_
") issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
the Class A Preferred Shares of the Company (the " _Company Preferred Shares_
", together with the Company Ordinary Shares, the " _Company Shares_ " )
shall be redeemed and canceled, subject to Section 1.2 and Section 2.3,
thereby transferring the entire economic interest in the Company to China
Growth as consideration for the right to receive that number of ordinary
shares of China Growth (" _China Growth Shares_ ") equal to that number
obtained by multiplying the Exchange Ratio with the number of such holder's
Company Ordinary Shares or Company Preferred Shares;

  



  

(d) each ordinary share of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be redeemed and canceled in
consideration of the issue of one (1) ordinary share of the Surviving
Corporation (which share shall be all of the issued and outstanding shares of
the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time) to China Growth;

  



  

(e) the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company shall be
amended and restated at and as of the Effective Time to read as did the
Memorandum and Articles of Association of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except that the name of the Company shall remain unchanged)
and such Memorandum and Articles of Association shall be the Memorandum and
Articles of Association of the Surviving Corporation to continue in full
force and effect until further amended in the manner prescribed by the
BVBCA, provided, however, that such Memorandum and Articles of Association
shall be reasonably close in form and aligned with current Company Memorandum
and Articles of Association.

  



  

(f) the officers of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of

the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal
or otherwise ceasing to be a director or until their respective
successors are duly appointed.

  



  

1.2 _Additional Merger Understandings and Agreements_.

  



  

(a) All China Growth Shares issued in accordance with Section 1.1(c) shall be
deemed to have been paid and issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Shares.

issued; in lieu thereof, China Growth shall issue one (1) China Growth Share
to the holder of any Company Shares that would otherwise be entitled to such
fractional China Growth Shares.

  



  

(c) The number of China Growth Shares which a holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.1(c) shall be adjusted to
appropriately reflect the effect of any division, combination, share dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into China
Growth Shares or Company Shares), extraordinary cash dividends,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to China Growth Shares or Company
Shares occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  



  

(e) At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Company Shares, as reflected in the register of members
of the Company, whether evidenced by share certificates (the " _Certificates_
") or not, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective
Time, any Certificates presented to China Growth for any reason shall be
exchanged for ordinary shares of China Growth to which the holders thereof
have the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.1(c).

Article III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE FOUNDER AND THE COMPANY

  



  

Subject to such exceptions as may be specifically set forth in the disclosure
letter of even date herewith separately delivered to China Growth (the "
_Disclosure Letter_ ") or as disclosed in the Company Commission Reports,
each of the Founder and the Company, respectively, represents and warrants to
China Growth as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, as
follows:

  



  

3.1 _Share Ownership; Subsidiaries_.

  



  

(a) _Share Ownership_. The Persons set forth in Section 3.1(a) of the
Disclosure Letter are the sole registered owners of Company Shares (each, a "
_Company Shareholder_ ") in the amounts set forth therein. As the date of this
Agreement, neither Founder nor the Company has received any written
notification regarding any Lien set in the other Company Ordinary Shares or
set in the Company Preferred Shares. Except for the convertibility of the
Company Preferred Shares, the Company has not granted any options, warrants
or other contractual rights outstanding which give any Person the right to
acquire any Company Shares, whether or not such right is presently
exercisable. To the Company's Knowledge, there are no disputes, arbitrations
or litigation proceedings pending or threatened with respect to Company
Shares.

  



  

(b) _Subsidiaries and Affiliates_. The Subsidiaries and Affiliates of the
Company, including the jurisdiction, form of entity, and capital structure,
are as set forth in the Company Commission Reports or the Disclosure Letter.
Except as may be otherwise indicated in Section 3.1(b) of the Disclosure
Letter or as disclosed in the Company Commission Reports, (i) all of the
outstanding shares of such Subsidiaries and Affiliates are validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable and are held free and clear of any Liens;
(ii) there are no consignments, Contracts and/or equity transfer
arrangements, options, warrants or other contractual rights or
arrangements outstanding which give any Person the right to acquire or
Control any capital stock or any substantial part of assets of any
such Subsidiary or Affiliates whether or not such right is presently
exercisable; and (iii) there are no Contracts and/or equity
transfer arrangements, options, warrants or other contractual rights (oral or
written), trusts or other arrangements of any nature which give any Person
the right to any stock rights or direct or beneficial interest in or from any
such Subsidiary or Affiliate

  



  

3.2 _Organization of Each Member of the Company Group_. Each member of the
Company Group is a corporate or other entity duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction. Each member of the
Company Group is duly qualified to do business in the jurisdictions in which
the property owned, leased or operated by such entity or the nature of the
business which it conducts requires qualification, or if not so qualified,
such failure or failures, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse. No member of the Company Group owns or is
a party to any agreement to acquire, directly or indirectly, any share
capital or any other equity securities or interest of any Person, other than
of a Subsidiary or Affiliate listed in Section 3.1(b) of the Disclosure
Letter or ordinary cash management investments consistent with industry
practices. Each member of the Company Group has all requisite power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
respective business as now being conducted and as presently contemplated to
be conducted.

other documents and instruments delivered by the Founder or the Company in

Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the Founder or the
Company is a party, when executed and delivered by the Founder or the Company,
will constitute the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Founder
or the Company, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except
(i) as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or similar Laws of general
application now or hereafter in effect affecting the rights and remedies of
creditors and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether

conflict with, result in a breach or violation of or constitute (or with
notice or lapse of time or both constitute) a default under, (A) the
Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company, (B) the certificate of
incorporation, articles of association or any other charter documents of any
member of the Company Group, or (C) any Law or Material Contract to which the

3.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Subject to the provisions of the Memorandum and
Articles of Association of the Company, other than as set forth in Section
3.4 of the Disclosure Letter or disclosed in the Company Commission Reports,
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents by the Founder and the Company, and the performance of and the
consummation of the Transactions by the Founder and the Company, does not and
will not require the Company to obtain any consent, approval,
authorization or other action by, or the Company to make any filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Authority, except as would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

3.5 _Licenses, Permits, Etc._ Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each member of the Company Group
possesses or will possess prior to the Closing all Permits necessary for the
ownership and operation of their businesses, which necessary Permits are
disclosed in the Company Commission Reports or described or are as set forth
in Section 3.5 of the Disclosure Letter. True, complete and correct copies of
such Permits issued to the member of the Company Group have previously been
delivered to China Growth. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect, all such Permits are in full force and
effect. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, each member of the Company Group has complied and will
comply, and have caused or will cause their respective officers, directors
and employees to comply, in all material respects with all terms of such
Permits, and will take or cause to be taken any and all actions necessary to
ensure that all such Permits remain in full force and effect and that the
terms of such Permits are not violated through the Closing Date. Except as
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, no
member of the Company Group is in default under any of such Permits and no
event has occurred and no condition exists which, with the giving of
notice, the passage of time, or both, would constitute a default thereunder.
Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or any of the other documents or instruments contemplated hereby or
thereby nor the consummation of the Transactions nor compliance by any member
of the Company Group with any of the provisions hereof or thereof will result
in any suspension, revocation, impairment, forfeiture or nonrenewal of any
