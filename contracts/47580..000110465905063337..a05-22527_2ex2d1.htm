employment made to him or her in accordance with Section 5.6(e)(i) or (ii)
above, any liabilities arising out of the termination of his or her
employment (including employers national insurance contributions with
respect thereto) shall be borne as to one third by the Buyer and as to

Consideration paid for the Shares, such amount as is required to indemnify
Guarantor (for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates); and

  

##### 

  

##### (B) if the employee in question is named in section B of Part D of

Retained Business) Sellers shall pay to Buyer, by way of adjustment to the
Consideration paid for the Shares, such amount as is required to indemnify
Buyer (for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates),

  



  

49

such redundancy or termination takes effect within the period of 12 months
from the Closing Date unless the Buyer otherwise agrees, the Guarantor shall
procure that the relevant Listed Employee shall work during his notice period

required to indemnify the Buyer on behalf of itself and its Affiliates to the
extent that any such liability is borne by either or both of them other than

5.6. The parties agree that any payment due from the Buyer or the Sellers, as
the case may be in the Agreed Proportions or under any other indemnity in

particular Brian Wallace) as it may reasonably require to facilitate the
timely public announcement of its results for the year to 31 December 2005,
timely completion of its 2005 year end Report and Accounts and to comply with
its regulatory obligations provided that access does not interfere with the
relevant Senior Executives ability to perform his duties under his
employment arrangements with his employer. The parties recognise that
following Closing the HI Entities may require advice and assistance from
persons remaining employed by the Guarantor and its Affiliates and that the
Guarantor and its Affiliates may require advice and assistance from
individuals who are or will become employees of the HI Entities or the
Buyer and its Affiliates on Closing. The parties agree to co-operate with
each other in order to provide reasonable access to the relevant

### employees on the basis that such advice and assistance does not interfere
with the relevant employees ability to perform his or her duties under his
employment arrangements with his own employer. Access to the Senior Employees
and the advice and assistance provided by the other employees referred to in
this Section 5.6(g) shall be on such reasonable terms as the Guarantor and
the Seller may from time to time agree.

  

### 

  

### (h) If any HI Employee is wholly or mainly engaged in the Retained
Business immediately prior to Closing and is found after Closing to still be
employed by an HI Entity, and the Buyer does not wish to employ that HI
Employee, the Buyer will notify the Guarantor of this fact within 5 Business
Days of becoming aware of it. Within 5 days of receiving such notification,
the Guarantor (or an Affiliate of the Guarantor) will make to the HI Employee
an offer of employment to be made on substantially the same terms and
conditions as were provided to that HI Employee immediately before Closing.
Once that offer has been made (or within 14 days of it being requested), the
parties will co- operate to procure that the HI Employee becomes an employee
of the Guarantor or one of its Affiliates.

  

### 

  

### (i) If any employee (other than a Listed Employee) of any member of the
Sellers Group after Closing was wholly or mainly engaged in the Business
immediately prior to Closing and the relevant member of the Sellers Group
does not wish to employ that person, the Guarantor will notify the Buyer of
this fact within 5 Business Days of becoming aware of it. Within 5 days of
receiving such notification, the Buyer will make to the employee an offer of
employment to be made in substantially the same terms and conditions as were
provided to that employee immediately before Closing. Once that offer has
been made (or within 14 days of it being requested), the parties will co-
operate to procure that the employee becomes an employee of an HI Entity.

  

### 

  

### (j) The parties agree that any liabilities arising out of the employment
from the Closing Date or the termination within 12 months of the Closing Date
of such employment of the employees referred to in Sections 5.6(h) and (i)
above shall be borne by the Buyer and the Guarantor as if the employee had
been properly identified and dealt with under Section 5.6(e) above and the
Buyer shall pay to the Sellers, by way of adjustment to the Consideration
paid for the Shares, such amount as is required to indemnify the Guarantor on
behalf of itself and its associates and the Sellers shall pay to the Buyer,
by way of adjustment to the consideration paid for the Shares, such amount as
is required to indemnify the Buyer on behalf of itself and its Affiliates to
the extent that any such liability is borne by either or both of them other
than in the Agreed Proportions.

### (l) Sellers shall, save as otherwise provided in this Section 5.6, pay to
Buyer, by way of adjustment to the Consideration paid for the Shares, such
amount as is required to indemnify Buyer (for itself and on behalf of its

#### 

  

in each case in relation to his or her employment during the period prior to
the Closing Date.

  



  

### (m) It is agreed that, where any indemnity arrangement contained in this
Section 5.6 may apply, the parties shall:

  

### 

  

#### (i) use their respective best efforts to comply with relevant employment
legislation in respect of such matter; and

  



  

53   

     
   

  



  

#### (ii) not admit or seek to compromise any liability to which such
indemnity may apply without the prior written authority of the indemnifying
party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

#### 

  

### (n)

  

### 

  

#### (i) The Guarantor shall be responsible for the cost of any bonus that
falls due to be paid after the Closing Date to any Listed Employee that
relates in whole or in part to the period up to 31 December 2005 and Sellers
shall, by way of adjustment to the Consideration paid for the Shares (other
than in respect of the bonuses referred to in Section 5.6(n)(iii) which shall
be paid direct by the Guarantor) pay an amount to the Buyer equal to the
amount that would have been payable to and in respect of each of the Listed
Employees that is then employed by an HI Entity together with an amount equal
to the employers national insurance contributions arising on such payments.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) The Buyer agrees that, subject to receipt of the payment referred
to in Section 5.6(n)(i), it will pay or procure to be paid to each such

#### (iii) The Guarantor (or one of its Affiliates) intends to pay to certain
HI Employees prior to Closing one-off discretionary bonuses. The Guarantor
represents that it has disclosed to the Buyer the amounts and the recipients
of such proposed bonuses. The Guarantor agrees that it shall consult with the
Buyer in good time in advance of making any further or additional one-off
discretionary bonuses to any HI Employees and shall consider in good faith
before making any such payments any representations made to it by the Buyer
regarding the terms of and effect that such payments may have on HI Employees
and/or the Buyers ability to retain such employees.

## Section 5.7. _Ancillary Agreements_. At Closing, Sellers and Guarantor
shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates that is to be a party to an
Ancillary Agreement to, execute such Ancillary Agreement, and Buyer
shall execute and deliver each of the Ancillary Agreements, in each case in
the form attached hereto.

  

## 

  

## Section 5.8. _Further Assurances_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Commencing on the date hereof, the parties shall cooperate with each
other and shall use their reasonable endeavors to cause their respective
officers, employees, agents, auditors and Representatives to cooperate with
each other for a period of not less than 1 year after the Closing Date, to
ensure the orderly transfer of the Business to Buyer and the orderly
separation of the Business from the Retained Business (including in each case
obtaining any necessary consents including licences); _provided that_ neither
party shall be obliged to take any step which is significantly disruptive to
its business and each party shall bear its own costs of taking any such
action.

  

### 

  

### (b) From time to time after the Closing Date, each party hereto shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates, in each case in good faith, to promptly
execute, acknowledge and deliver any other assurances or documents or
instruments of transfer reasonably requested by the other party hereto and

55   

     
   

  



  

## Section 5.9. _Public Announcement_. The initial press release regarding
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be a joint press
release in agreed form.  Neither Buyer nor Guarantor (for and on behalf of
itself and Sellers) shall issue any other press release or make any other

the extent required by applicable Laws or stock exchange requirements or
otherwise disclosed in connection with a judicial or regulatory proceeding,
in which case that party shall use its reasonable efforts to consult with the
other party and to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such
release before issuing any such release or making any such public statement.

  

## 

  

## Section 5.10. _Confidentiality_.

  

## 

  

### (a) After the Closing Date, except to the extent required by Law or
applicable regulation, Guarantor shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
treat as strictly confidential and not disclose or make use of any
confidential or non-public information, related to the Business and shall
safeguard and prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination or disclosure of
such information, knowledge and data, except as otherwise agreed to by Buyer
in writing.

  

### 

  

### (b) After the Closing Date, except to the extent required by Law or
applicable regulation, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, treat
as strictly confidential and not disclose or make use of any confidential or
non-public information, related to the Retained Business that becomes known
to Buyer as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
shall safeguard and prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination or disclosure
of such information, knowledge and data, except as otherwise agreed to by
Guarantor in writing.

  

### 

  

### (c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the confidentiality
obligations set forth herein shall not extend to (i) information that is
publicly available or becomes publicly available through no act or omission
of the party owing a duty of confidentiality, or is or becomes available on a
non-confidential basis to the party owing a duty of confidentiality so long
as such source is not known by such party to be bound by any duty of
confidentiality to the other party, (ii) information that is required to be
disclosed to any Government Entity in accordance with applicable Law or is
otherwise disclosed in connection with a judicial or regulatory proceeding
and (iii) disclosure to advisers or providers of finance who owe a duty of
confidentiality to the person disclosing that information and (iv)
information that is disclosed to any Tax Authority. In the event a party
hereto (or its Affiliates or its or their respective Representatives) becomes
legally compelled to disclose, other than to a Tax Authority, any
information, knowledge or data that is subject to the confidentiality
provisions of this Section 5.10, such party shall, subject to applicable Law,
provide the other party with prompt written notice of such requirement so
that the other party may seek, at its expense, a protective order, injunction
or other remedy and, if such

  



  

56   

     
   

  



  

### protective order, injunction or other remedy is not obtained, the
compelled party shall use its best efforts to disclose only that portion of
the information that is required by applicable Law to be disclosed, and to
obtain legally binding assurances that confidential treatment will be
afforded to such disclosed material.

  

### 

  

### (d) In the event of a breach of the obligations hereunder by Buyer or
either Seller, the other party, in addition to all other available remedies,
will be entitled to seek injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this
Section 5.10 in any court of competent jurisdiction.

  

### 

  

### (e) All information related to both (i) the Business, and (ii) the
Retained Business shall be treated in accordance with Sections 5.10(a) and
(b); _provided, however,_  that both Buyer and Sellers (and their respective
Affiliates) shall be entitled to apply such information in the conduct of the
Business and the Retained Business respectively, but (save as required by
Law) shall only disseminate it to third parties after prior consultation with
the other party and subject to confidentiality restrictions.

  

### 

  

## Section 5.11. _Transactions with Affiliates_. Guarantor agrees to procure
that any Related Party Agreements remaining at Closing (other than
the Ancillary Agreements) including any Related Party Agreements entered into
in the Ordinary Course for the provision of goods and services are on
commercially reasonable arms length terms. In the event that any Related
Party Agreement (other than those contained in any Ancillary Agreement and
intercompany balances to be dealt with in accordance with Article II),
survives Closing, Buyer shall have the right (which shall expire on the date
60 days after Closing if such Related Party agreement was disclosed on
_Schedule 5.11_ hereto or in the case of Related Party Agreements which were
not so disclosed, the one year anniversary of Closing), to terminate (and
Guarantor shall procure that such agreements are terminated at Buyers
request) any Related Party Agreement without any cost, further liability or
termination fee (but no other remedy), if it is not on
reasonable arms-length commercial terms; _provided_ _that_ Buyer first
attempts to renegotiate in good faith to amend any such Related Party
Agreement to provide reasonable arms length commercial terms. Further, if
the provision of services or other contractual performance under any Related
Party Agreement would require Buyer or any Affiliate to apply for any licence
under any gaming or betting Laws, Buyer shall have the right to terminate
(and Guarantor shall procure that such agreements are terminated at Buyers
request) any such Related Party Agreement.

  

## 

  

## Section 5.12. _Guarantees_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Guarantor shall use reasonable endeavors to procure, at its cost,
that at Closing each HI Entity is released from all guarantees, indemnities,
surety bonds, lease sureties, letters of credit and letters of comfort ("
_Guarantees_ ") given or extended by such HI Entity on behalf of any member
of Sellers Group and not related to the Business and that all obligations of
the HI Entities in respect

  



  

57   

     
   

  



  

### thereof are terminated, with, in each case, such removal, release and
termination to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no member of the Sellers Group shall
be obliged to incur any cost (other than legal costs and other advisors
fees), including without limitation pledge any assets, exercise any right of
counter-claim or set-off or withhold payment of any sum in doing so. If
required in order to obtain any such release, Guarantor or another member of
Sellers Group shall enter into a Guarantee with the releasing beneficiary on
substantially identical terms as the Guarantee from which an HI Entity is
being released. If Guarantor has been unable to effect any such removal,
release and termination with respect to any such Guarantee effective as of
Closing, Guarantor agrees that after Closing it shall use its reasonable
efforts, at its cost, to effect such substitution, removal and release and
termination as soon as possible subject to the proviso above. Sellers covenant
to pay to Buyer, by way of adjustment to the consideration paid for the
Shares, such amount as is required to indemnify on an after-Tax basis and
hold Buyer and its Affiliates (including the HI Entities), as applicable,
harmless from and against and in respect of any and all liabilities, damages,
losses, claims, proceedings, judgments and settlements (" _Loss_ ") incurred
by Buyer and its Affiliates (including the HI Entities), after Closing under
or pursuant to any such Guarantee to the extent that (i) such Loss relates to
the Retained Business and not to the Business and (ii) such Loss was not
caused by and did not result from any actions of Buyer or any HI Entity.

  

### 

  

### (b) Buyer shall use reasonable endeavors to assist Sellers so that at
Closing each member of Sellers Group is released from all Guarantees given
by such member on behalf of any HI Entity and related to the Business and
that all obligations of the Sellers Group in respect thereof are terminated,
with, in each case, such removal, release and termination to be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Guarantor; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Buyer shall not be obliged to incur any cost or liability (save to the
extent reimbursed by Guarantor), including without limitation pledging any
assets, exercise any right of counter-claim or set-off or withhold payment of
any sum in doing so. If required in order to obtain any such release, Buyer
shall enter into a Guarantee with the releasing beneficiary on substantially
identical terms as the Guarantee from which a member of Sellers Group is
being released.  If Buyer has been unable to effect any such removal, release
and termination with respect to any such Guarantee effective as of Closing,
Buyer agrees that after Closing it shall use its reasonable efforts to effect
such substitution, removal and release and termination as soon as possible
subject to the proviso above. Buyer covenants to pay to Sellers, by way of
adjustment to the consideration paid for the Shares, such amount as is
required to indemnify on an after-Tax basis and hold the relevant member of
the Sellers Group harmless from and against and in respect of any and all
Losses incurred by such member of the Sellers Group, after Closing under (i)
any such Guarantee (to the extent that (x) such Loss relates to the Business
and not to the Retained Business and (y) such Loss was not caused by and did
not result from any actions of any member of Sellers Group (or any HI Entity
prior to Closing)); and (ii) any

  



  

58   

     
   

  



  

### lease of real property in respect of which any member of the Sellers
Group has a liability for rent as a former tenant as a consequence of a
default after Closing by any HI Entity. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Sellers agree to indemnify Buyer on an after-Tax
basis as follows: (i) to the extent that Buyer suffers any Loss under this
Section 5.12(b) in relation to a Guarantee as a consequence of any default by
an HI Entity prior to Closing, save to the extent that such default arose by
reason of Buyers unreasonable refusal to give or unreasonable delay in
giving any consent required under Section 5.2 and (ii) to the extent that
Buyer suffers any Loss under this Section 5.12(b) in relation to a Guarantee
if Closing does not occur. Such Losses will not be subject to the limitations
set forth in Article VII.  

  

### 

  

### (c) The parties shall cooperate with each other to effect the actions
referred to in this Section 5.12. The parties further agree that neither
party may amend the Guarantees or the obligations in respect of which they
are given or take other affirmative action that would increase the costs or
liabilities of the other party without such partys prior written consent.

  

### 

  

### (d) If any action, claim or demand is brought or alleged against any
member of the Sellers Group, Buyer or, as the case may be, any HI Entity
(the " _Relevant Indemnified Party_ ") in respect of which an indemnity is to
be sought from either Buyer or, as the case may be, a member of the Sellers
Group (the " _Relevant Indemnifying Party_ ") pursuant to this Section 5.12,
the Relevant Indemnified Party shall forthwith notify the Relevant
Indemnifying Party thereof and the Relevant Indemnifying Party shall have the
option to assume the defense thereof. If the Relevant Indemnifying Party fails
to assume such defense, it will be liable to the Relevant Indemnified Party
for reasonable legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
Relevant Indemnified Party in connection with such defense.

  

### 

  

### (e) If the Relevant Indemnifying Party gives notice to the Relevant
Indemnified Party that it shall assume such defense, subject to the Relevant
Indemnifying Party indemnifying the Relevant Indemnified Party in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Relevant Indemnified Party against any
liability, cost, damage or expense which may be incurred thereby (but without
thereby implying any admission of liability on the part of the Relevant
Indemnifying Party), the Relevant Indemnified Party shall:

  

### 

  

#### (i) promptly take such action and give such information and access to
personnel, premises, chattels, documents and records (which if within the
control of the Relevant Indemnified Party, the Relevant Indemnified Party
shall procure are preserved) to Relevant Indemnifying Party and its
professional advisers as Relevant Indemnifying Party may reasonably request
and Relevant Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to require the Relevant
Indemnified Party to take such action and

  



  

59   

     
   

  



  

#### give such information and assistance as it may reasonably request in
order to avoid, dispute, resist, mitigate, settle, compromise, defend or
appeal any claim in respect thereof or adjudication with respect thereto;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) at the request of the Relevant Indemnifying Party, allow the
Relevant Indemnifying Party to take the sole conduct of such actions as
Relevant Indemnifying Party may deem appropriate in connection with any such
assessment or claim in the name of Relevant Indemnified Party and in that
connection Relevant Indemnified Party shall give or cause to be given to
Relevant Indemnifying Party all such assistance as it may reasonably request
in avoiding, disputing, resisting, settling, compromising, defending or
appealing any such claim and shall instruct such solicitors or other
professional advisors as Relevant Indemnifying Party may nominate to act on
behalf of Relevant Indemnified Party but to act solely in accordance with
Relevant Indemnifying Partys instructions; and

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) make no admission of liability, agreement, settlement or
compromise with any third party in relation to any such claim or adjudication
without the prior written consent of Relevant Indemnifying Party.

  

#### 

  

### (f) If the Relevant Indemnified Person is a member of the Sellers Group
who is not either of Sellers, Sellers shall procure that such member complies
with its obligations pursuant to this Section.

  

### 

  

## Section 5.13. _Treasury Consent_. Between the date hereof and Closing,
Sellers and Guarantor undertake that they will apply for and take reasonable
steps to obtain special consent from HM Treasury under section 765 ICTA 1988
(" _Treasury Consent_ ") to the extent that this is required in respect of
the assignment of debt referred to in Section 1.9 of _Schedule 2.2_  of this
Agreement (Transfer and Assumption of Inter-Company Amounts at Closing).

  

## 

  

## Section 5.14. _Cooperation; Records_.

  

## 

  

### (a) From the Closing Date, upon reasonable prior written notice, Buyer
and Sellers shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and their
employees, counsel, auditors and Representatives (i) reasonable access,
during normal business hours, to such information, employees and assistance
relating to the Business and the HI Entities as is reasonably necessary for
financial reporting and accounting matters (other than in connection with the
Closing Statement or December 31 Balance Sheet calculations), it being
understood that Buyer may be seeking to dispose of portions of the Business
and (ii) such other documents and reports required to be filed with any
Government Entity or required for the preparation of its financial statements
or in connection with any action, suit, demand, claim, hearing, proceeding or
investigation by or

  



  

60   

     
   

  



  

### before any Government Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
disclosing party shall not be required to do any of the foregoing unless the
requesting party provides evidence, in a form which is satisfactory to the
disclosing party that shows that the requesting party requires the
said access or information for one of the aforementioned purposes; _provided_
, _however_ , also that in no event shall the requesting party have access to
any information that in the reasonable judgment of the disclosing party,
would (A) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or
could reasonably be expected to give rise to, or prejudice it in relation to,
any claim or possible claim under this Agreement or (B) violate any
obligation of the disclosing party or any of its Affiliates with respect to
confidentiality or any applicable Law; and it being further understood that
the requesting party shall reimburse the disclosing party and its Affiliates
promptly for reasonable expenses it incurs in complying with any such request
by or on behalf of the requesting party; and _it being further understood_
that the disclosing party shall inform the requesting party if, in its
judgment, it is entitled to decline access on the basis of paragraphs (A) or
(B) in relation to any information that has been requested. Each party agrees
that, as a condition precedent to performing any of the obligations required
by this Section 5.14(a), each party may require the other party and its
Affiliates (as appropriate) to enter into a confidentiality agreement
containing terms and conditions which would be customary and reasonable in
connection with the access and information referred to in this Section
5.14(a). In any event, the terms and conditions of any such confidentiality
agreement shall be no more onerous than the confidentiality provisions
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. Each party shall reimburse the
other parties for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
assisting such party pursuant to this Section 5.14(a). No party shall be
required by this Section 5.14(a) to take any action that would unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of its business or unreasonably disrupt its normal
operations.

  

### 

  

### (b) At Closing, Sellers shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer
or otherwise put under control of Buyer and its Affiliates, the Books and
Records of Sellers and its Affiliates relating to the Business and in
Sellers or such Affiliates possession, it being understood that Books and
Records relating to the HI Entities which are held at the premises of the HI
Entities shall remain with such HI Entities after Closing and Sellers shall
have no obligation to deliver such Books and Records to the extent it has
transferred possession of the relevant HI Entity to Buyer at Closing subject
to the following exceptions:  (i) Sellers may retain all Books and Records
which relate to Affiliates or divisions of Sellers Group other than those
constituting part of the Business and shall provide copies of the relevant
portions thereof which relate to the Business to Buyer; (ii) Sellers may
retain all Books and Records prepared for the purpose of the sale of the
Business or any part thereof, including bids received from other parties and
analyses relating to the Business; (iii) Sellers may retain one copy of any
Books and Records necessary in its reasonable judgment to perform its
obligations and determine its liabilities under this Agreement and/or the Tax
Deed.

## Section 5.15. _Insurance_.

  

## 

  

### (a) To the extent that any of the Insurance Policies cover any loss or
liability relating to the Business and arising out of an occurrence prior to
the Closing (such loss or liability, an " _Insured Loss_ "), Sellers agree to
the extent permitted by Law to cooperate with Buyer, the HI Entities and
their respective Affiliates in submitting and pursuing claims on Buyers
behalf under such Insurance Policies with respect to such Insured Losses,
including the actions set forth in (i) through (vi) below;  _provided_ that
Buyer agrees to reimburse Sellers and their Affiliates for all reasonable and
documented out of pocket costs and expenses actually incurred by them in
connection with any such claim.

  

### 

  

#### (i) (in respect of claims made following Closing) informing the issuer
of such policy of insurance of the likelihood of any such claim arising as
soon as possible following receipt of request so to do from Buyer;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) keeping Buyer informed on a regular basis of the progress of any
such claim;

#### (iv) permitting Buyer to make and/or take over the conduct of any such
claim in the name of the Sellers Group or any member thereof provided that,
to the extent that the claim relates to the period of Guarantors ownership
of the HI Entities, Buyer undertakes to keep Guarantor informed of the
progress of such claim and to consult with Guarantor in relation to such
conduct taking account of Guarantors reasonable requests in relation to such

### (b) Buyer covenants to pay to Sellers, by way of adjustments to the
Consideration, such amount as is required to indemnify and hold each member

") pursuant to this Section 5.19, the Indemnified Party shall forthwith
notify the Indemnifying Party thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall have
the option to assume the defence thereof. If the Indemnifying Party fails to
assume such defence, it will be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal
or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with such defence. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the
defence, the provisions of Section 5.12(d) will apply _mutatis mutandis_.

  



  

67   

     
   

  



  

### (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.19, the

used predominantly in the Business to be assigned to an HI Entity, then the
Hyperion L3 Support and Enterprise contract shall be excluded from this
Section 5.19.

by Sellers Group for stays prior to December 31, 2006 and (ii)
the shareholder discount schemes for hotels and LivingWell clubs operated
by Sellers Group where bookings are made on or before the date of the
Shareholders Meeting for any stays or visits prior to December 31, 2006.

## Section 5.26. _Associated Contracts_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Subject to obtaining any necessary consents of Governmental Entities,
including a licence from the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control
(the " _OFAC_ ****_Licence_ ", and together with such other third party
consents as Buyer may require to be obtained, the " _Sudan Consents_ "), TCF
will novate and transfer all and any right, title or interest to the
Associated Contracts to Stakis Limited or to such entity as Buyer directs.
 Guarantor, Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate to obtain as promptly
as practicable the Sudan Consents, including cooperating in making a filing
in order to obtain the OFAC Licence. If the Sudan Consents have not been
obtained by Closing to the satisfaction of Buyer, Guarantor shall retain the
rights under the Associated Contracts after Closing, and shall, to the extent
lawful and upon receipt by Buyer of a licence or interpretation from OFAC
allowing such an arrangement, account

  



  

73   

     
   

  



  

### to Buyer for any net profit, including on disposal, derived from the
Associated Contracts from and after Closing.

  

### 

  

### (b) If it is determined by Buyer that the Sudan Consents will not be
obtained or will be obtained only on conditions which are unacceptable to
Buyer and Buyer receives a licence or interpretation from OFAC allowing Buyer
to direct the sale of the Associated Contracts and receive the proceeds
therefrom (such OFAC Licence, the " _Sale Licence_ "), Guarantor will
undertake (subject to owners consents) to transfer the contracts to a third
party at Buyers direction and cost; _provided that_ if Guarantor is unable to
transfer such Associated Contracts within twenty-four (24) months of Buyers
determination to sell the rights under the Associated Contracts, Guarantor
will procure a termination of the Associated Contracts at Buyers cost. If
neither the necessary Sudan Consents nor the Sale Licence has been obtained
by the date thirty-six (36) months after Closing, TCF shall be entitled to
terminate the Associated Contracts and Buyer (to the extent lawfully able to
do so) will indemnify Sellers Group on an after Tax basis against all Losses
or claims (calculated on a net basis) arising therefrom. The consideration
payable for the Associated Contracts shall be determined in accordance with
Section 5.19 and the Consideration shall be adjusted in accordance with that
section.

  

### 

  

### (c) Buyer (to the extent lawfully able to do so) will indemnify Sellers
on an after Tax basis (i) against any operating costs arising from Sellers
Groups continued operation of the Associated Contracts after Closing
provided that such costs are not offset by revenues derived from such
Associated Contracts, (ii) against any Losses or claims resulting from taking
any action at Buyers request to terminate or transfer the Associated
Contracts and (iii) against any claims from remaining as the contracting
party under those contracts or otherwise associated with the hotels to which
they relate.

  

### 

  

### (d) Sellers will indemnify and hold harmless Buyer on an after Tax basis
against any Losses or claims brought by Governmental Entities in respect of
the Associated Contracts arising from Sellers Groups operation of the
Associated Contracts prior to Closing _provided that_ Sellers shall have no
liability until such Losses exceed £1.5 million and then, only to the extent
of such excess up to an aggregate maximum of £10 million. Buyer and Sellers
shall make an initial joint filing with respect to the OFAC Licence. Buyer
will consult with Sellers and take reasonable account of its comments in
relation to any other filing with or submission to a relevant Government
Entity in connection with the Associated Contracts. Sellers will give Buyer
all reasonable co-operation and assistance in connection therewith.

  

### 

  

## Section 5.27. _Financing Transactions_. During the Trilogy Negotiation
Period, Buyer may, at its option, seek to negotiate Trilogy Transaction
Documents with the relevant parties. If Trilogy Transaction Documents have
not been executed by all the

  



  

74   

     
   

  



  

## relevant parties by the end of the Trilogy Negotiation Period, or prior to
the conclusion of the Trilogy Negotiation Period Buyer has decided for any
reason to forego assuming the indebtedness, then upon notice from Buyer
Guarantor shall proceed to terminate the Trilogy transaction.  Guarantor
shall be responsible for the costs and expenses incurred in connection with
terminating the transaction and settling in full all obligations associated
therewith; _provided that_ if Trilogy Transaction Documents are prepared at
Buyers request, all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the parties in
connection with the negotiation and preparation of the Trilogy Transaction
Documents shall be borne by Buyer.

  

## 

  

## Section 5.28. _Restrictions on HIC Shares_. Buyer undertakes with Sellers
and Guarantor that for a period of one year from Closing, Buyer shall not
take any action (or cause or permit any action to be taken) after Closing as
a result of which HIC becomes a 75 per cent subsidiary of a company
resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes.  For the purposes of this
Section 5.28:

  

## 

  

(i) a company is a 75 per cent subsidiary of another company if and so long
as not less than 75 per cent of its ordinary share capital (as defined in
section 832 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988) is owned directly by that
other company; and

  



  

(ii) relevant percentages are calculated by reference to the nominal value of
the shares in question.

  



  

Section 5.29. _Treasury Transactions_.

  



  

### (a) Sellers and Buyer shall co-operate with a view to the amendment,
restructuring and replacement of the financing and other treasury
arrangements listed on _Schedule 5.29_ attached to the Disclosure Letter made
available to the HI Entities so that:

  

### 

  

#### (i) those Arrangements may continue after Closing for the benefit of the
HI Entities without any support (including, without limitation, by way of
Guarantees (as defined in Section 5.12(a)) from the Sellers Group and
without any breach of covenant or event of default as a result of the
Closing;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) all cash pooling, group netting and other cash management
Arrangements are able to operate at and after Closing in such a way that no
member of the Sellers Group is a party to the Arrangements provided to the
HI Entities and no HI Entity is a party to the Arrangements provided to the
Sellers Group; and

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) all financing and other treasury Arrangements are made available
exclusively to either HI Entities or the Sellers Group, but not to both in
the same Arrangements.

  



  

75   

     
   

  



  

Buyer, to the extent reasonably requested by Sellers, shall co-operate with
Sellers with a view to achieving these objectives, including, where
requested, if such requests are consistent with Buyers past practice, by way
of the provision of information to banks and financial institutions, if the
information is agreed by the recipient to be kept confidential. Sellers, to
the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, shall co-operate with Buyer with a
view to achieving these objectives, including, where requested, by way of
introducing Buyer to the banks or other financial institutions providing
these financing and other treasury Arrangements to the HI Entities.

  



  

### (b) Sellers may effect any amendment, restructuring or replacement (or
procure that the HI Entities effect such amendment, restructuring or
replacement) of the financing and other treasury Arrangements made available
to the HI Entities for the purposes described in paragraph (a); provided that
the terms and documentation of such amendment, restructuring or replacement
shall be subject, insofar as they relate to the HI Entities, to the
reasonable consent of Buyer.

  

### 

  

### (c) Buyer shall use reasonable endeavours to assist Sellers so that at or
before Closing each member of the Sellers Group is released from all
Guarantees in respect of the Arrangements given by such member on behalf of
any HI Entity and that all obligations of the Sellers Group in respect
thereof are terminated, with, in each case, such removal, release and
termination to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Guarantor;
provided, however, that Buyers shall not be obliged to incur any cost or
liability (other than legal costs and other advisors fees),
including without limitation pledge any assets, exercise any right of
counter-claim or set-off or withhold payment of any sum in doing so. If
required, in order to obtain any such release, Buyer shall enter into a
Guarantee with the releasing beneficiary on substantially identical terms as
the Guarantee from which a member of the Sellers Group is being released. If
Buyer has been unable to effect any such removal, release and termination
with respect to any such Guarantee effective as of Closing:

  

### 

  

#### (i) Buyer agrees that after Closing it shall use its reasonable efforts
to effect such substitution, removal and release and termination as soon as
possible subject to the proviso above; and

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Buyer covenants to pay to Sellers, by way of adjustment to the
consideration paid for the Shares, such amount as is required to indemnify on
an after-Tax basis and hold the relevant member of the Sellers Group
harmless from and against and in respect of any and all Losses incurred by
such member of the Sellers Group after Closing under any such Guarantee to
the extent that (x) such Loss relates to the Business and not to the Retained
Business and (y) such Loss was not caused by and did not result from any
actions of any member of Sellers Group (or any HI Entity prior to Closing).
Buyer shall only assume

  



  

76   

     
   

  



  

#### liabilities under this Section 5.29 for Guarantees and other liabilities
arising prior to the date hereof if such liabilities were described in
_Schedule 5.29_ attached to the Disclosure Letter .

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Buyer also agrees that after Closing it shall not (and it shall
ensure that no HI Entity shall) amend any obligations in respect of which any
such Guarantee is given in a manner that would increase the costs or
liabilities of any member of the Sellers Group under such Guarantee.

  

#### 

  

This section shall be without prejudice to Guarantors and Sellers
obligations under Section 5.12 hereof.

  



  

### (d) Where, at or after three (3) weeks after the date hereof and prior to
Closing, Sellers reasonably determine that (or determine that there is a
material risk that):

  

### 

  

#### (i) a Guarantee in respect of an Arrangement will not be released by
Closing,

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) a cash pooling, group netting and other cash management Arrangement
will not operate at and after Closing in the manner described in paragraph
(a)(ii) above, or

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) a financing or other treasury Arrangement will not at or after
Closing be made available exclusively to either HI Entities or the Sellers
Group, but not to both in the same arrangements,

  

#### 

  

then provided that such action is taken (i) with the prior written consent of
Buyer or (ii) upon giving 20 days notice to Buyer and after having used
reasonable efforts to allow these Arrangements to continue after Closing for
the benefit of the HI Entities as described in paragraph (a), Sellers may:

  



  

(i) prepay, cancel and terminate (or procure that the HI Entities prepay,
cancel and terminate) the financing or treasury Arrangements in respect of
which the Guarantee referred to in paragraph (i) is provided or take (or
procure that the HI Entities take) any other actions or steps with a view to
that Guarantee being discharged or released; and

  



  

(ii) terminate the cash pooling, group netting and other cash management
Arrangements referred to in paragraph (ii) and the financing and other
treasury Arrangements referred to in paragraph (iii).

  



  

### (e) Sellers may, in any event, repay, cancel or not renew any financing
or treasury Arrangement made available to the HI Entities where Buyer

  



  

77   

     
   

  



  

### and Sellers agree in writing that financing or treasury Arrangement is no
longer required for the purposes of the Business, either with the prior
written consent of Buyer or after the 20-day Notice Period.

  

### 

  

### (f) Nothing in this Section 5.29 shall apply to the Financing
Transactions.

  

###

the context of the transaction to be effected by this Agreement, that if

expected to permit Buyer to invoke such change or deterioration for the
purposes of withdrawing its offer, having particular regard to Practice
Statements issued from time to time by the Takeover Panel, and general
principles of English contract law.

  



  

78   

     
   

  



  

### (b) _Representations and Warranties_. The aggregate liability which
Sellers would have for qualifying breaches of the representations and

warranty is given which, for the avoidance of doubt shall, in the case of
warranties deemed repeated at Closing, be the Closing Date) having regard to

state.  Buyer acknowledges and confirms that the signatories to the
certificate shall have no personal liability in respect of such certificate
and Buyer hereby waives any claim it may have against signatory in respect of
the certificate (save in respect of fraud by the signatory). The receipt of
the certificate shall not, in the absence of fraud by a member of Sellers
Group, provide Buyer with any cause of action against, or result in any
additional liability of, the Sellers Group above the liability which would
result from other provisions of this Agreement.

and adversely affect the ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

ARTICLE VII

  



  

# _SURVIVAL; LIMITATIONS ON CLAIMS_

  



  

## Section 7.1. _Survival_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Buyer shall be entitled to claim damages after Closing for breach of
any of the Sellers Warranties set out in Part A of Article III which is
given by reference to the facts and circumstances prevailing at the date of
this Agreement (or, if different, at the date referred to in each particular
Warranty) and for breach of any of the Closing Warranties if they are untrue
at the Closing Date with reference to the facts and circumstances prevailing
at the Closing Date. Sellers Warranties contained in Part A of Article III
shall survive Closing until the date (the " _Survival Date_ ") six (6) months
after the completion and filing on Form 10-Q of Buyers unaudited
consolidated financial statements for and as of the end of the first fiscal
quarter of Buyer after Closing.  Thereafter, in the event notice of any claim
has been given (in accordance with Section 10.1) before the Survival Date,
specifying in reasonable detail the information then available to Buyer and
Buyers estimate or calculation of the Loss alleged to have been suffered (in
accordance with Section 7.5 below), that are subject of such claim shall
survive with respect to such claim until such time as such claim is finally
resolved. The Survival Date shall in no event be later than the date falling
6 months after the 40th day following the last day of the fiscal quarter in
which Closing occurs.

  

### 

  

### (b) Buyers only remedy for breach if the Sellers Warranties set out in
Part (A) of Article III (other than the Closing Warranties) would be

  



  

80   

     
   

  



  

### untrue if repeated at Closing shall be to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the condition in Section 6.2(b).

  

### 

  

### (c) Buyers only remedy for breach of the Sellers Warranties set out in
Part (B) of Article III as made at the date hereof or deemed repeated at
Closing shall be to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the condition in
Section 6.2(b).

  

### 

  

### (d) For purposes of the condition in Section 6.2(b), a "qualifying
breach" is an individual breach which would give rise to a liability of
£1,500,000 or more in aggregate.

  

### 

  

### (e) In the event that the aggregate liability which Sellers would have
damages for breaches of the Covenants (excluding the Tax Deed) actually known
by Buyer to have occurred prior to Closing are likely to exceed £100,000,000,
Buyers only remedy for such breaches shall be to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the condition in Section 6.2(c). Buyer shall be entitled, however,
to claim damages after Closing for breach of Covenants (i) not actually known
by Buyer prior to Closing to have occurred or (ii) known by Buyer at Closing
but reasonably estimated by Buyer, as of Closing, to be in an aggregate
amount less than £100,000,000 subject to the Covenant Deductible. Such damage
claims for breach of Covenants prior to Closing shall survive Closing until
the Survival Date.

  

### 

  

### (f) Buyer shall not be entitled to terminate or rescind this Agreement
after Closing.

  

### 

  

### (g) Sellers acknowledge that Buyer enters into this Agreement in reliance
on the Sellers Warranties. Buyer acknowledges that it does not rely on and
has not been induced to enter into this Agreement on the basis of
any warranties, representations, covenants, undertakings, indemnities or
other statements whatsoever, other than those expressly set out in this
Agreement and acknowledges that no member of the Sellers Group or any of
their agents, officers or employees (including agents officers and employees
of the HI Entities) have given or made any such warranties, representations,
covenants, undertakings, indemnities or other statements.

  

### 

  

## Section 7.2. _Limit on Quantum_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Sellers shall not be liable to Buyer for damages or any other payment
for or in respect of any Losses caused by a breach by a Seller of one of
Sellers Warranties in respect of any individual claim for less than
£1,500,000 and unless and until the aggregate of all such claims for which
Seller would, but for the Warranty Deductible, be liable exceeds £75,000,000
(the " _Warranty Threshold_ "), in which case the Seller shall be liable for
the amount by which such Losses exceed £37,500,000 (the " _Warranty
Deductible_ ").

  



  

81   

     
   

  



  

### (b) The total aggregate liability of Sellers in damages to Buyer in
respect of claims for breaches by Sellers of Sellers Warranties and the
Covenants under this Agreement shall not exceed an amount equal to three
point seven five percent (3.75%) of the Final Purchase Price (the "
_Aggregate Cap_ "); _provided, however_  that none of the Warranty Threshold,
the Covenant Deductible, the Warranty Deductible or the Aggregate Cap shall
apply in the case of fraud; and _provided further_ that Losses resulting from:

  

### 

  

#### (i) breaches of Sellers Warranties contained in Section 3.2(d) and (i)
(for purposes of this proviso, relating to shares in the HI Central Entities
and Material Subsidiaries only), Section 3.3 (Corporate Authorization) and
Section 3.6(a) and (b) (in each case other than clause (iv)) and Section
3.6(c) (other than clauses (i)(D), (ii)(D), (iii)(D), (iv)(D), (v)(D),
(vi)(D) and (vii)(D)) (Real Property);

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) the Tax Deed;

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Section 2.1; and

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) the Covenants set out in Section 5.2;

  

#### 

  

shall (in each case) not be subject to the Aggregate Cap, and the maximum
aggregate liability of Sellers for breach of such Sellers Warranties,
breaches of the Covenants in Section 5.2, breaches of Section 2.1 hereof and
under the Tax Deed shall be the Final Purchase Price.

  



  

### (c) Sellers shall not be liable to Buyer for damages or any other payment
for or in respect of any Losses caused by a breach by a Seller of one of the
Covenants unless and until the aggregate of all claims for which Seller
would, but for this clause, be liable exceeds £25,000,000 (the " _Covenant
Deductible_ "), in which case the Seller shall be liable for the amount by
which such Losses exceed the Covenant Deductible; _provided_ that the Covenant
Deductible shall not apply to any Loss incurred in connection with a breach
of Section 5.2(b)(xviii).

  

### 

  

### (d) Nothing in this Section 7.2 shall place any limitation on Buyers
entitlement to seek an order of specific performance of the obligations of
Sellers or Guarantor to perform the affirmative Covenants in Article II,
Article V or under the Transitional Services Agreement, and any amounts paid,
assets transferred or services rendered in accordance with such obligations
(including indemnification obligations therein) shall not count towards, or
be subject to, the Covenant Deductible or the Aggregate Cap; _provided
however_ that the Covenant Deductible will apply to any claim for damages (as
opposed to specific performance) as a result of breaches of Section 5.2, and
_provided further_ that the foregoing proviso does not prevent the Buyer from
seeking specific performance at any time for a violation or breach of Section
5.2, without regard to the

  



  

82   

     
   

  



  

### Covenant Deductible. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties agree
that, any proceeds payable under any policy of insurance or other
amounts paid over pursuant to the terms of Section 5.15 are not Losses caused
by a breach and shall not count towards, or be subject to, the Covenant
Deductible or the Aggregate Cap.

  

### 

  

## Section 7.3. _Disclosure Letter_. Buyer shall not be entitled to claim
that any fact, matter or circumstance caused any Warranty to be breached to
the extent disclosed in the Disclosure Letter.

  

## 

  

## Section 7.4. _General Limitations_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Seller shall only be liable in respect of any claim if and to the
extent that such claim is admitted by Seller or ordered by a court of
competent jurisdiction.

  

### 

  

### (b) Buyer agrees and undertakes that (in the absence of fraud) it has no
rights against and shall not make any claim against any employee, director,
agent or officer of Sellers or Sellers Group on whom it may have relied
before agreeing to any term of this Agreement and any other agreement or
document entered into pursuant to this Agreement or entering into this
Agreement or any such other agreement, including references to such
persons "Knowledge" herein. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer agrees
(in the absence of fraud by the relevant individual) to make no claim
against, and to hold the individuals identified in the definition of
"Knowledge" harmless against any claim which Buyer might otherwise make as
a result of their being so named.

  

### 

  

### (c) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Sellers do not give or make any
representations or warranties as to the accuracy of the forecasts, estimates,
projections or statements of intent or opinion or information provided to
Buyer (however so provided) on or prior to the date of this Agreement,
including (without limitation) in the Disclosure Letter or the information
supplied to or made available to Buyer during its due diligence exercise.

  

### 

  

### (d) Buyer shall not be entitled to claim under the Sellers Warranties to
the extent that:

  

### 

  

#### (i) the matter giving rise to the claim has resulted in an adjustment to
the purchase price pursuant to Article II; or

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) the claim relates to Tax; or

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) the matter giving rise to the claim has been dealt with under the
provisions of Sections 5.19 or 5.20.

  



  

83   

     
   

  



  

### (e) Buyers right to damages in respect of any claim asserted by Buyer
pursuant to the first sentence of Section 3.2(e) shall be eliminated if such
Loss can be cured by Sellers pursuant to Section 5.19.

  

### 

  

## Section 7.5. _Notification of Claims after Closing_. Buyer, promptly
after the general counsel or board of directors of Buyer becomes aware of the
circumstances giving rise to the claim (provided that delay shall
not prejudice the claim save to the extent that delay increases the liability
of Sellers or either of them), shall give to Sellers written notice of any
claim it has for breach of the Warranties specifying (to the extent
reasonably available) the matter which gives rise to the claim, the nature of
the claim and the amount claimed in respect thereof (detailing Buyers good
faith and without prejudice calculation of the Loss thereby alleged to have
been suffered by it or the relevant member of Buyers Group) before the
Survival Date specified in Section 7.1 **;** provided, however, __ that the
liability of Sellers in respect of such claim shall absolutely determine (if
such claim has not been previously satisfied, settled or withdrawn) if legal
proceedings in respect of such claim shall not have been commenced within
nine months of the service of such notice and for this purpose proceedings
shall not be deemed to have been commenced unless they shall have been
properly issued and validly served upon Sellers.

  

## 

  

## Section 7.6. _No Liability for Contingent or Non-Quantifiable Claims_. If
any breach of Sellers Warranties or any other term of this Agreement arises
by reason of some liability of the HI Entities or Buyer which, at the time
such breach or claim is notified to Sellers, is contingent only or otherwise
not capable of being quantified, then Sellers shall not be under any
obligation to make any payment in respect of such breach or claim unless and
until such liability ceases to be contingent or becomes capable of being
quantified; _provided that_  the operation of the time period referred to in
the proviso to Section 7.5 shall be suspended and shall not be deemed to
commence until the date such liability ceases to be contingent or becomes
capable of being quantified and Buyer has provided notice of such claim.

  

## 

  

## Section 7.7. _Third Party Claims_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Upon Buyer or any member of Buyers Group becoming aware of any
claim, action or demand against it or any other matter likely to give rise to
any claim in respect of any of Sellers Warranties or any other term of this
Agreement, Buyer shall and shall procure that the appropriate member of
Buyers Group shall:

  

### 

  

#### (i) notify Sellers in accordance with Section 7.5;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) subject to Sellers indemnifying Buyer or the relevant member of
Buyers Group in a form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer against any
liability, cost, damage or expense which may be incurred thereby (but without
thereby implying any admission of liability on the part of Sellers), to the
extent it is not likely to lead to a loss of legal privilege, promptly take
such action and give such information and access

  



  

84   

     
   

  



  

#### to personnel, premises, chattels, documents and records (which Buyer
shall procure are preserved) to Sellers and their professional advisers as
Sellers may reasonably request and Sellers shall be entitled to require the
relevant member of Buyers Group to take such action and give such
information and assistance as is reasonably required in order to avoid,
dispute, resist, mitigate, settle, compromise, defend or appeal any claim in
respect thereof or adjudication with respect thereto; and

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) make no admission of liability, agreement, settlement or
compromise with any third party in relation to any such claim or adjudication
without the prior written consent of Sellers.

  

#### 

  

### (b) In connection with defending any such third-party claim, Sellers
shall consult with Buyer from time to time and shall provide Buyer with all
relevant information or documents that Buyer may reasonably request in
relation to the defense of the third-party claim.

  

### 

  

### (c) Sellers shall be entitled at any stage and at its absolute discretion
to settle any such third party claim, action or demand if Buyer is released
from such claim, action or demand and is unconditionally and irrevocably
released from all liability in relation thereto.

  

### 

  

## Section 7.8. _No Liability if Loss is Otherwise Compensated_.

  

## 

  

### (a) No liability shall attach to Sellers by reason of any breach of any
of the Sellers Warranties or any other term of this Agreement to the extent
that the same Loss has been recovered by Buyer under any other Warranty or
term of this Agreement or any other document entered into pursuant hereto and
accordingly Buyer and those deriving title from Buyer may only recover once
in respect of the same Loss.

  

### 

  

### (b) Sellers shall not be liable for breach of any of the Warranties to
the extent that the subject of the claim has been or is made good or is
otherwise compensated for without cost to Buyer or any other member of
Buyers Group.

  

### 

  

### (c) In calculating the liability of Sellers for any breach of the
Sellers Warranties or any other term of this Agreement there shall be taken
into account the amount by which any Tax for which the HI Entities or Buyer
is now or in the future accountable or liable to be assessed is reduced or
extinguished as a result of the matter giving rise to such liability. This
shall not, however, impose on Buyer any obligation to disclose details of its
Tax affairs to Sellers.

  



  

85   

     
   

  



  

## Section 7.9. _Recovery from Insurers_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Where Buyer or any member of Buyers Group is entitled to recover
from the Insurance Policies of Sellers Group any sum in respect of any
matter giving rise to a claim under the Warranties, Buyer shall, and shall
procure that the member of Buyers Group concerned shall, use reasonable
efforts to take all necessary steps to enforce such recovery. In the event
that Buyer or any member of Buyers Group shall recover any amount under such
Insurance Policies, the amount of the claim against Seller (as applicable)
shall be reduced by the amount so recovered or shall promptly repay to Seller
the lesser of (i) the amount paid by Seller to Buyer in respect of such claim
and (ii) the amount so recovered, in each case, after deducting the expenses
of recovery and any Tax payable on such recovered sum.

  

### 

  

### (b) If either Seller pays at any time to Buyer or any member of Buyers
Group an amount pursuant to a claim in respect of any provision of this
Agreement and Buyer or the relevant member of Buyers Group subsequently
recovers from some other person any sum in respect of the matter resulting in
the claim, Buyer shall, and shall procure that the relevant member of Buyers
Group shall forthwith repay to the relevant Seller the lesser of (i) the
amount paid by the relevant Seller to Buyer or relevant member of Buyers
Group and (ii) the sum (including interest, if any, but deducting any costs
of recovery of such sum and any Taxes payable on such recovered
sum) recovered from such other person to the extent such sum is in
immediately available funds and has been unconditionally paid to Buyer (or
any member of Buyers Group).

  

### 

  

## Section 7.10. _Acts of Buyer_. No claim shall lie against Seller under or
in relation to the Warranties to the extent that such claim is attributable
to:

  

## 

  

### (a) any voluntary act, omission or transaction carried out at the written
request of or with the written consent of Buyer before Closing or under the
terms of this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereunder; or

  

### 

  

### (b) any voluntary act, omission or transaction carried out by Buyer or
any HI Entity or on its behalf or by persons deriving title from Buyer or by
a member of Buyers Group after Closing other than where such act, omission
or transaction is required by Law or a pre-existing legally binding
commitment in each case, existing on the date hereof.

  

### 

  

### (c) any admission of liability made in breach of the provisions of this
Agreement after the date hereof by Buyer or any HI Entity or on its or their
behalf or by persons deriving title from Buyer or by a member of the Buyers
Group on or after Closing.

  

### 

  

## Section 7.11. _Future Legislation_. No liability shall arise in respect
of any breach of any term of this Agreement to the extent that liability for
such breach occurs or

  



  

86   

     
   

  



  

## is increased directly or indirectly as a result of any legislation not in
force on or prior to the date of this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## Section 7.12. _Buyer s Knowledge_. On the date hereof Buyer is not aware
of any matter giving rise to a claim for material breach of Warranty.

  

## 

  

## Section 7.13. _Claim to be Reduction of Consideration_.  Any payment made
by Sellers or any other person in respect of any claim under Sellers
Warranties or for breach of any other term of this Agreement or under any
Covenant contained in this Agreement shall, so far as is possible, be a
reduction of the Consideration.

  

## 

  

## Section 7.14. _Aggregation of Claims_. If events of the same
or substantially similar nature which result from the same cause occur and
Sellers would not otherwise be liable in relation to any or all of the single
claims for breach of a Warranty, the amount of such claims in relation to
such events shall be aggregated and shall be deemed to constitute a single
claim for the purposes of Section 7.2(a).

  

## 

  

## Section 7.15. _Mitigation_. Nothing in this Agreement shall or shall
be deemed to relieve or abrogate Buyer of any common law or statutory duty
to mitigate any Loss or damage including, without limitation, enforcing
against any person (other than Sellers) any rights any member of the Buyers
Group has or may have in respect of the fact, matter or circumstance giving
rise to the claim.

  

## 

  

## Section 7.16. _Remedies_. The rights and remedies of Sellers and
Buyer under Articles VI and VII are exclusive and in lieu of all other
rights and remedies which Sellers or Buyer may have under this Agreement or
otherwise (except pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement) against each other
with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby for monetary relief with
respect to any breach of any representation or warranty or any failure to
perform any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement and Buyer and
Sellers each expressly waives all other rights or causes of action it or its
Affiliates may have against the other party or its Affiliates now or in the
future under any Law with respect to the subject matter hereof.  The
remedies expressly provided in this Agreement shall constitute the sole and
exclusive basis for and means of recourse between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto
recognize that the Shares, Properties and HI Assets are unique and that
specific performance will be available to Buyer with respect to the delivery
of the Shares or to bring actions for injunctions to preserve the status quo
pending resolution of any disputes relating to the Agreement or restrain
breaches of or enforce compliance with the covenants and agreements in
Article II or V.

  

## 

  

## Section 7.17. _No Setoff_. Save as expressly provided herein, Buyer shall
not be entitled to set off any amount owed by Buyer to Sellers under this
Agreement against amounts otherwise owed by Sellers to Buyer under this
Agreement. Save as expressly provided herein, Sellers shall not be entitled
to set off any amount owed by Sellers to Buyer under this Agreement against
amounts otherwise owed by Buyer to Sellers under this Agreement.

  



  

87   

     
   

  



  

## Section 7.18. _Limits and Qualifications on Buyer s Liability_.  The
provisions relating to limitations on liability, notification and conduct of
claims, voluntary acts and other matters addressed in Sections 7.4 through
7.15 above shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to the liability of Buyer under
Article IV and Article V, as if references to Buyer in Sections 7.4 through
7.15 were references to Sellers Group and references to Sellers (or Sellers
Group) therein were references to Buyer. Subject to the foregoing,
Sellers shall be entitled to claim damages for breach and to seek orders of
specific performance in respect of any breaches of Buyers Warranties or its
obligations under Sections 2.1 and 2.2.

## Section 8.1. _Termination_.

  

## 

  

### (a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to Closing:

  

### 

  

#### (i) by written agreement of Buyer, Sellers and Guarantor;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) by either Buyer or Guarantor, by giving written notice of such
termination to the other, if Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to
the Back-Stop Date so long as the terminating party (or in the case of the
Guarantor, both it and the Sellers) is not in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement;

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) by Buyer or Guarantor, if the Required Seller Shareholder Approval
shall not have been obtained prior to the Back-Stop Date;

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) by Buyer, if the Guarantor shall not have posted the Circular by
January 31, 2006 (unless the reason for this is lack of UKLA approval
provided Guarantor has used all reasonable efforts to obtain its approval),
or the Independent Directors of Guarantor have withdrawn their recommendation
that shareholders vote in favour of the resolution approving this Agreement
(otherwise than on account of written notice from Buyer that it intends not
to Close by reason of breach of Condition by Buyer or written notice from
Buyer that it is unable to fund the acquisition);

  

#### 

  

#### (v) by Buyer if the financial statements contained in the Circular sent
to the shareholders are materially different from the financial statements
contained in the draft of the Circular attached as _Schedule 8.1(v)_

  



  

88   

     
   

  



  

#### to the Disclosure Letter to an extent which would entitle Buyer to
terminate for breach of a condition under Section 6.2(c);

  

#### 

  

#### (vi) by Buyer if at any time the thresholds set forth in Section 6.2(b)
or Section 6.2(c) are exceeded; or

  

#### 

  

#### (vii) by Buyer in the event that Section 8.2(b)(i)(D) applies.

  

#### 

  

### (b) This Agreement may not be terminated unilaterally by Buyer at any
time after the Required Seller Shareholder Approval has been obtained until
the Back-Stop Date.

  

### 

  

## Section 8.2. _Effect of Termination_.

  

## 

  

### (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.1, this Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no effect,
and no party hereto shall have any liability to the other party hereto or
their respective Affiliates, or their respective directors, officers or
employees, except for the obligations of the parties hereto contained in this
Article VIII, Article IX, Section 5.12(b) and in Section 10.1, Section 10.4,
Section 10.6, Section 10.7 and Section 10.8 (and any related definitional
provisions set forth in Article I), and except that nothing in this Article
VIII shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement
that arose prior to such termination, for which liability the provisions
of Article VII shall remain in effect in accordance with the provisions
and limitations of such Article.

  

### 

  

### (b) (i)   _If_ :

  

### 

  

##### (A) the Independent Directors (as defined in the Circular) of Guarantor
have withdrawn their recommendation to shareholders to vote in favour of the
resolutions to approve this Agreement (otherwise than on account of written
notice from Buyer that it intends not to Close by reason of breach of
Condition by Buyer or written notice from Buyer that it is unable to fund the
acquisition) and at any time subsequently this Agreement is terminated by
Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(iv);

  

##### 

  

##### (B) a Person other than Buyer (or an Affiliate of Buyer) completes an
Acquisition prior to the termination of the Agreement;

  

##### 

  

##### (C) prior to the Shareholders Meeting, a Person other than Buyer (or an
Affiliate of Buyer) announces an intention to make an offer or an offer under
Rule 2.4 of the

  



  

89   

     
   

  



  

##### City Code on Takeovers and Mergers or otherwise to effect an
Acquisition which is, in any material respect, conditional upon
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement not proceeding on the terms
set out in this Agreement or is otherwise structured in a manner designed to
induce the Guarantors shareholders to vote against the Required Seller
Shareholder Approval, and subsequently this Agreement is terminated by either
Buyer or Guarantor pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(iii), and within twelve (12)
months of such termination, a Person other than Buyer (or an Affiliate of
Buyer) completes an Acquisition;

  

##### 

  

##### (D) the Shareholders Meeting is not held for any reason (unless the
reason for this is the lack of UKLA approval of the Circular _provided that_
 Guarantor has used all reasonable efforts to obtain its approval) by
February 15, 2006; or

  

##### 

  

##### (E) the Circular is not posted by January 31, 2006 (unless the reason
for this is the lack of UKLA approval provided that Guarantor has used all
reasonable efforts to obtain its approval);

  

##### 

  

#### (ii) _then_ , provided that this Agreement has been terminated (save for
this obligation and other surviving obligations), Guarantor shall promptly,
and in no event later than five Business Days after the date of such
termination or event, pay Buyer, by wire transfer of same-day funds, a
termination fee of Thirty Seven Million British Pounds Sterling (£37,000,000)
(the " _Termination Fee_ ") exclusive of any VAT payable (free of lien,
charge, claim or right of set-off) by wire transfer of same day funds. To
the extent Buyer may reclaim any amount in respect of VAT, it will do so at
Sellers cost and pay such reclaimed amount to Sellers.

# _SELLERS  GUARANTEE_

  



  

## Section 9.1. _Sellers  Guarantee_.

  

## 

  

### (a) In consideration of Buyer agreeing to purchase the Shares and the
Associated Contracts on the terms set out in this Agreement, the Guarantor
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Buyer the due and
punctual performance and observance by the Sellers of all of
their obligations, commitments and undertakings under this Agreement.

  



  

90   

     
   

  



  

### (b) Any payment to be made by the Guarantor under this Article IX shall
be made in full without any set off, restriction, condition or deduction for
or on account of any counterclaim including, without limitation, any set-off,
restriction, condition or deduction for or on account of any claim or
prospective claim under any provision of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c) If and whenever a Seller defaults for any reason whatsoever in the
performance of any obligation, commitment or undertaking undertaken or
expressed to be undertaken under or pursuant to this Agreement, the Guarantor
shall forthwith upon demand unconditionally perform (or procure performance
of) and satisfy (or procure satisfaction of) the obligation, commitment or
undertaking in regard to which such default has been made in the manner
prescribed by this Agreement and so that the same benefits shall be conferred
on Buyer as would have been received if such obligation, commitment or
undertaking had been duly performed and satisfied by such Seller.

  

### 

  

### (d) This guarantee is to be a continuing guarantee and accordingly is to
remain in force until all the obligations of the Sellers shall have been
performed or satisfied, regardless of the legality, validity or
enforceability of any provisions of this Agreement and notwithstanding the
winding-up, liquidation, dissolution or other incapacity of the Sellers or
any change in the status, control or ownership of the Sellers. This guarantee
is in addition to, without limiting and not in substitution for, any rights
or security which Buyer may now or after the date of this Agreement have or
hold for the performance and observance of the obligations, commitments and
undertakings of the Sellers under or in connection with this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (e) As a separate and independent stipulation, the Guarantor agrees that
any obligation, commitment or undertaking expressed to be undertaken by the
Sellers (including, without limitation, any moneys expressed to be payable
under this agreement) which may not be enforceable against or recoverable
from the Sellers by reason of any legal disability or incapacity on or of
Buyer or any fact or circumstance (other than any limitation imposed by this
Agreement) shall nevertheless be enforceable against and recoverable from the
Guarantor as though the same had been incurred by the Guarantor and the
Guarantor were the sole or principal obligor in respect thereof and shall be
performed or paid by the Guarantor on demand.

  

### 

  

### (f) For the avoidance of doubt, references in this Article to sums owed
by the Sellers or due and payable by the Sellers shall be construed subject
to all relevant limitations on the liability of the Sellers under this
Agreement.

determined in such courts.  The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which they may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such
court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such
dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a judgment in any such
dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by law. This Agreement shall be construed on
the basis that each party is acting in good faith.  This shall not, however,
imply any right or obligation which is not provided for in this Agreement.

to act on Buyers behalf.  The provisions of this Section applying to service
on an agent apply equally to service on a replacement agent.

  

### 

  

### (d) A copy of any Service Document served on an agent shall be sent by
post to Buyer.  Failure or delay in so doing shall not prejudice the
effectiveness of service of the Service Document.

 **Schedule 2.2**

  



  

 **Calculation of Purchase Price**

  



  

 **1.1** General Principles

  



  

The parties intend that this Schedule shall be interpreted in accordance with
the following principles:

  



  

 Subject to the limited exceptions noted below:

  



  

 Buyer will assume the economic risk and reward in the Business with effect
from 00:01 on January 1, 2006.

  



  

 Accordingly, the Division should operate from that date on a self-funding
basis and cash generated by the Division after that date is for Buyers
account.

  



  

 Any cash passing between the Division and the Sellers Group after December
31, 2005, other than on trading account, will be compensated for, to put
the parties into the economic position they would have been in if the
Division had been self-funding from that date.

  



  

 Buyer will be entitled to receive the proceeds of any disposal of the
Divisions assets received after that date.

  



  

 Exceptions:

  



  

 Buyer will receive the benefit of trading of the Division from January 1,
2006 but the price will be subject to adjustment to pass the benefit back to
Sellers from March 7, 2006 if Closing has not occurred by then.

  



  

 The economic benefit and burden of certain assets and liabilities which are
in the Division after December 31, 2005 but which are identified in Section
1.7 of this _Schedule 2.2_ as belonging with retained business will be for
the account of the Seller.  Accordingly:

  



  

 Sellers will bear the cost of discharging the MSDW Debt, and

  



  

 there will be no price reduction for assets which are required to be passed
back to the Sellers Group between signing and Closing under the Interim
Reorganisation provisions nor will there be a corresponding price increase
for assets which are required to be

  

   

     
   

  



  

passed into the Division between signing and Closing under the Interim
Reorganisation provisions. It is noted, in each case, that many of these
steps have already been completed.

  



  

 **Price**

  



  

 The working capital position will be measured as at December 31, 2005 and
the price will be adjusted £ for £ if the amount of working capital falls
outside the agreed range.

  



  

 The price will also adjust £ for £ to reflect the amount by which the third
party financial indebtedness of the Division recorded in the December 31,
2005 financial statement exceeds any surplus cash (above an agreed amount) in
the division shown in that statement.

  



  

 **Trading Between 1 Jan and Closing**

  



  

 All cash that is loaned in or out of the Division (by or to Sellers Group)
after December 31, 2005 will be settled £ for £ promptly after Closing with
interest.

  



  

 All trading (as specifically defined herein) between the Division and the
remainder of Sellers Group after 31 December 2005 will be settled £ for £ in
the ordinary course and in any event within 30 days of invoice.

  



  

 **Inter-company Balances**

  



  

 Inter-company balances between companies in the Division and members of the
Sellers Group as at December 31, 2005 will be dealt with as follows.

  



  

 All such balances will accrue interest up to the Closing Date.

  



  

 The benefit of all inter-company balances (other than trading balances) due
from the companies in the Division to members of the Sellers Group will be
assigned to Buyer.

  



  

 Buyer will assume the liabilities of all members of the Sellers Group to
any companies in the Division in respect of all inter-company balances (other
than trading balances).

  



  

 No further adjustments to the cash purchase price payable by Buyer shall be
made as a result of such assignments and assumptions, and any difference
between the aggregate value of the HI Payables and the aggregate value of the
HI Receivables shall be dealt with as a book entry adjustment only.

  



  

 Inter-company balances between companies in the Division and members of the
Sellers Group which arise after December 31, 2005 will be dealt with as
follows:

  

   

     
   

  



  

 Since the Division is meant to be self-funding after December 31, 2005,
subject to the exceptions noted above, these balances will be settled in cash
promptly after closing with accrued interest.

  



  

 **Accounts**

  



  

 December 31 Financial Statement will be prepared using agreed policies,
principles, management judgements and assumptions.

  



  

 **1.2** Initial Purchase Price

  

 ** **

  

(a) The total consideration for all the Shares (and, if applicable, the
Associated Contracts, whether or not ultimately assigned to the Buyer) ("the
_Consideration_ ") shall be £3,298,438,961.45 (the " _Base Purchase_ Price"),
as such price may be adjusted pursuant to the provisions of this _Schedule
2.2_ and Article VII hereof and the Tax Deed.  The Base Purchase Price has
been calculated as follows:

  



  

 £3,700,000,000.00, less

  



  

 £373,253,416.00 (Adnams net sale proceeds), less

  



  

 £14,803,480 (Edinburgh Airport net sale proceeds), less

  



  

 £13,504,142.55 (agreed valuation of Tindall partnership interest, which is
excluded from the sale).

  



  

(b) The Consideration shall be allocated between the shares in LuxCo and
LHUSA as set out in Schedule 2.2(Y).

  



  

(c) At Closing, Buyer shall pay to Sellers the Base Purchase Price adjusted
in accordance with sub-section (e) below (the Base Purchase Price, as
so adjusted being the "Initial Purchase Price").

  



  

(d) The Initial Purchase Price shall be paid in cash.

  



  

(e) The Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows:

  



  

(i) the Base Purchase Price shall be increased or reduced by the following
amounts:

  



  

##### (A) The Base Purchase Price shall be _increased_ by:

  

##### 

  

(1) the amount by which the Provisional Cash Surplus exceeds the Provisional
December 31 Indebtedness Amount;

  

   

     
   

  



  

(2) the amount of the Provisional Working Capital Surplus (if any);

  



  

(3) the amount of the Estimated 2006 Subscriptions; and

  



  

(4) the amount of the Delay Adjustment for every day after March 7th 2006 if
Closing has not occurred by that date (save to the extent that the delay is
occasioned by (i) any delay in posting the Circular, (ii) adjournment of the
shareholders meeting of Guarantor, (iii) the failure of Section 6.1(c) to
be satisfied as a result of Law or Orders of Governmental Entities, or (iv)
any delays caused by the Sellers failure to complete the Interim
Reorganisations contemplated by Section 5.18).

  



  

##### (B) The Base Purchase Price shall be _reduced_ by:

  

##### 

  

(1) the amount by which the Provisional December 31 Indebtedness Amount
exceeds the Provisional Cash Surplus;

  



  

(2) the amount of the Provisional Working Capital Shortfall (if any); and

  



  

(3) the amount of the Estimated 2006 Distributions.

  



  

 **1.3** Preliminary December 31 Financial Statement

  

 ** **

  

(a) Sellers shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and delivered to Buyer as
soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than forty-five (45)
days after the date hereof, the Preliminary December 31 Financial Statement
showing:

  



  

###### **** the Provisional December 31 Indebtedness Amount

  

###### ** **

  

###### **** the Provisional Cash Surplus

  

###### ** **

  

 the Provisional Working Capital Surplus (if any)

  



  

 the Provisional Working Capital Shortfall (if any)

  

   

     
   

  



  

###### **** the Estimated 2006 Subscriptions

  

###### ** **

  

###### **** the Estimated 2006 Distributions

  

###### ** **

  

 the Estimated Delay Adjustment (if any).

  



  

In addition, the Preliminary December 31 Financial Statement shall include
a good faith calculation of the Provisional HI Payables and Provisional
HI Receivables.

  



  

(b) Sellers and Buyer will negotiate in good faith to resolve, to the extent
practicable prior to Closing, any objections which Buyer may have to the
calculation of the items enumerated in sub-clause (a) above.

  



  

If Buyer and Sellers agree to any modifications requested by Buyer, these
shall be reflected in the adjustment to the Base Purchase Price under Section
1.2(e) as if they had been reflected in the Preliminary December 31 Financial
Statement and the Preliminary December 31 Financial Statement shall be
amended to reflect these adjustments for the purposes of Sections 1.4 and 1.5
below.

  



  

However, if Buyer and Sellers do not agree to any of the modifications (if
any) requested by Buyer, then with respect to such items, the Base Purchase
Price shall be adjusted on the basis of the Preliminary December 31 Financial
Statement.

  



  

From the Closing Date to the date of the agreement or determination of the
December 31 Financial Statement, the Sellers (and their advisors) shall be
permitted, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, reasonable access at
all reasonable times to (i) the Books and Records (and shall have the right
to take copies thereof with the consent of Buyer, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld), and (ii) employees of the HI Entities or the Business
as Seller may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing, agreeing or
determining the Preliminary December 31 Financial Statement.

  



  

 **1.4** Determination of the December 31 Financial Statement

  

 ** **

  

(a) From delivery of the Preliminary December 31 Financial Statement to the
date of the agreement or determination of the December 31 Financial
Statement, Buyer (and its advisors) shall be permitted, to the extent
permitted by applicable Laws, reasonable access at all reasonable times to
the Books and Records, employees, and work papers prepared by Guarantor and
its Affiliates to the extent that they relate to any of the HI Entities or
the Business and to the extent in the possession or control of

  

   

     
   

  



  

Guarantor or any of its Affiliates (and shall have the right to take copies
thereof with the consent of the Sellers, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld) as Buyer may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing,
agreeing or determining the Preliminary December 31 Financial Statement.

  



  

(b) On or prior to the date which is the sooner of (i) thirty (30) days after
the date of receipt by Buyer of the audited financial statements of the
Business prepared for inclusion in Buyers Form 8-K to be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission or (ii) seventy-five (75) days after
Closing (" _Review Period_ "), Buyer may object to the Preliminary December
31 Financial Statement by delivering to Sellers a written statement (the "
_Statement of Objections_ ") setting forth:

  



  

(i) a reasonably specific description of Buyers objections to the
Preliminary December 31 Financial Statement; and

  



  

(ii) Buyers proposed adjustments (including the estimated monetary amounts
and reasons for each proposed adjustment) to the Preliminary December 31
Financial Statement resulting from such objections and Buyers calculations
of:

  



  

 the Cash Surplus

  



  

 the December 31 Indebtedness Amount

  



  

 the Working Capital Surplus (if any)

  



  

 the Working Capital Shortfall (if any)

  



  

 the 2006 Subscriptions (if any)

  



  

 the 2006 Distributions (if any)

  



  

 the Delay Adjustment (if any)

  



  

 the HI Payables

  



  

 the HI Receivables

  



  

(c) If Buyer delivers the Statement of Objections on or prior to the last day
of the Review Period, Sellers and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith for a
period of twenty (20) days from the date of delivery to Sellers of the
Statement of Objections (the " _Negotiation Period_ ") to resolve such
objections, and, if the same are so resolved, the Preliminary December 31

  

   

     
   

  



  

Financial Statement (as amended to reflect the adjustments so agreed) shall
thereupon become final and binding.

  



  

(d) If Buyer fails to deliver the Statement of Objections within the Review
Period the Preliminary December 31 Financial Statement shall become final and
binding on the parties at close of business in Los Angeles, California on the
last day of the Review Period.

  



  

(e) If Sellers and Buyer shall fail to reach an agreement with respect to any
of the matters set forth in the Statement of Objections within the
Negotiation Period, then only such matters not resolved (the " _Unresolved
Matters_ ") shall, not later than ten (10) days after the last day of the
Negotiation Period, be submitted for resolution to KPMG in the UK or such
other impartial internationally recognized firm of independent accountants as
may be agreed by Buyer and Guarantor (the " _Accounting Expert_ ") (provided
that if KPMG will not accept such appointment and Buyer and Guarantor cannot
mutually agree on an alternative Accounting Expert, such Accounting Expert
shall be appointed by the President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
of England and Wales, following application from either Buyer or Sellers).
The Accounting Expert shall, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator,
determine each Unresolved Matter in accordance with _Schedule 2.2(X)_.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Expert shall be borne as the
Accounting Expert directs or, in the absence of direction, 50% by Sellers and
50% by Buyer. If required by the Accounting Expert, Guarantor and Buyer will
each agree to accept joint and several liability for the whole of its fees
and expenses.

  



  

(f) The Accounting Expert shall (subject to (g) below) determine the
procedures and timetable for his review and any such determination shall be
binding on the parties but shall provide Sellers and Buyer an opportunity to
make written submissions to the Accounting Expert on Unresolved Matters.
Copies of any written submissions to the Accounting Expert by Sellers or
Buyer shall be delivered promptly to the non-submitting party. To the
extent permitted by applicable Laws, Sellers and Buyer shall, and shall use
reasonable efforts to procure that their respective accountants shall, each
make readily available to the Accounting Expert all relevant work papers and
Books and Records relating to the Business and the HI Entities to the extent
relevant to the Preliminary December 31 Financial Statement upon request from
the Accounting Expert.

  



  

(g) The Accounting Expert shall be instructed to make a determination as soon
as practicable, but no later than thirty (30) days (or such other time as
the parties hereto and the Accounting Expert shall agree in writing) after
the written submissions to it on the Unresolved Matters, and its resolution

  

   

     
   

  



  

of the Unresolved Matters and the adjustments to the Preliminary December 31
Financial Statement shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto
(in the absence of fraud or manifest error).

  



  

 **1.5** Post-Closing Price Adjustments

  

 ** **

  

(a) The Initial Purchase Price shall be adjusted as provided in sub-clause
(b) below and the net amount due from Buyer to Sellers or from Sellers to
Buyer (as applicable) shall be paid in Pounds Sterling by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing
by Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be on the date five (5) Business Days
following the date on which the Preliminary December 31 Financial Statement
(and any adjustments thereto) become final and binding (or, if later, three
(3) Business Days after the payee provides the payer with written details of
the account to which payment is to be made) as follows:

  



  

(b) the Initial Purchase Price shall be increased by the sum of the
following:

  



  

(i) the amount (if any) by which the Provisional December 31 Indebtedness
Amount exceeds the December 31 Indebtedness Amount;

  



  

(ii) the amount (if any) by which the Cash Surplus exceeds the Provisional
Cash Surplus;

  



  

(iii) the amount (if any) by which the Working Capital Surplus exceeds the
Provisional Working Capital Surplus;

  



  

(iv) the amount (if any) by which the Provisional Working Capital Shortfall
exceeds the Working Capital Shortfall;

  



  

(v) the amount (if any) by which the 2006 Subscriptions exceed the Estimated
2006 Subscriptions;

  



  

(vi) the amount (if any) by which the Estimated 2006 Distributions exceed the
2006 Distributions; and

  



  

(vii) the amount (if any) by which the Delay Adjustment exceeds the Estimated
Delay Adjustment.

  



  

(c) the Initial Purchase Price shall be reduced by the sum of the following:

  



  

(i) the amount (if any) by which the December 31 Indebtedness Amount exceeds
the Provisional December 31 Indebtedness Amount;

  

   

     
   

  



  

(ii) the amount (if any) by which the Provisional Cash Surplus exceeds the
Cash Surplus

  



  

(iii) the amount (if any) by which the Provisional Working Capital Surplus
exceeds the Working Capital Surplus;

  



  

(iv) the amount (if any) by which the Working Capital Shortfall exceeds the
Provisional Working Capital Shortfall;

  



  

(v) the amount (if any) by which the Estimated 2006 Subscriptions exceed the
2006 Subscriptions;

  



  

(vi) the amount (if any) by which the 2006 Distributions exceed the Estimated
2006 Distributions; and

  



  

(vii) the amount (if any) by which the Estimated Delay Adjustment exceeds the
Delay Adjustment.

  



  

 **1.6** Settlement of Trading Balances

  

 ** **

  

From Closing:

  



  

(a) Sellers shall procure that each Trading Balance owed by any member of
Sellers Group to any HI Entity is settled in the Ordinary Course (and in any
event within 30 days of invoice), in immediately available funds without set-
off, restriction or condition and without any deduction or withholding (save
as may be required by Law) in the currency in which such Trading Balance is
due; and

  



  

(b) Buyer shall procure that each Trading Balance owed by any HI Entity to
any member of Sellers Group is settled in the Ordinary Course (and in any
event within 30 days of invoice), in immediately available funds without set-
off, restriction or condition and without any deduction or withholding (save
as may be required by Law) in the currency in which such Trading Balance is
due.

  



  

 **1.7** Repayment of inter-company debt arising after December 31, 2005

  

 ** **

  

(a) Within five (5) Business Days after Closing, Sellers shall notify Buyer
of the actual amount of any inter-company indebtedness (other than Trading
Balances and other than as set forth in Section 1.7(c) below) from any of
the HI Entities to any member of the Sellers Group and from any member of
the Sellers Group to any of the HI Entities which has arisen after December
31, 2005 and on or prior to the Closing Date.  (Notwithstanding the
foregoing calculation, any inter-company indebtedness (other than Trading
Balances and other than as set forth in Section 1.7(c) below) that

  

   

     
   

  



  

is determined to have been excluded, or misstated, in Sellers statement
shall be paid off and settled promptly upon discovery or determination.)

  



  

(b) Subject to Section 1.7(c) below, within five (5) Business Days
following the date on which Buyer receives the notification referred to in
Section 1.7(a) above:

  



  

(i) Sellers shall procure that each member of the Sellers Group to which any
HI Entity has advanced any loan after December 31, 2005 shall repay that loan
in cash in the currency in which such loan is due together with interest at
the Base Rate accrued due up to the date of repayment;

  



  

#### (ii) Buyer shall procure that each of the HI Entities to which any
member of the Selling Group has advanced any loan after December 31, 2005
shall repay that loan in cash in the currency in which such loan is due
together with interest at the Base Rate accrued due up to the date of
repayment.

  

#### 

  

(c) Any inter-company indebtedness arising from:

  



  

(i) the transfer of any asset from the HI Entities to any member of the
Sellers Group after the date hereof pursuant to Section 5.18 (Interim
Reorganisation);

  



  

(ii) the transfer from any HI Entity to any member of Sellers Group, or the
transfer from any member of Sellers Group to any HI Entity, of any other
assets after the date hereof and on or prior to Closing pursuant to Section
5.18; or

  



  

(iii) the funding by the Sellers Group of the MSDW Debt,

  



  

shall, in each case, be treated as if such inter-company indebtedness had
arisen before December 31, 2005 for the purposes of Sections 1.7 and
1.9 (inclusive).

  



  

 **1.8** Interest

  



  

(a) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Initial Purchase Price,
Sellers shall pay to Buyer interest at the Base Rate on the amount due to
Buyer under Section 1.4 or 1.5 for the period from Closing to the date on
which repayment is made to Buyer of the amount due.

  



  

(b) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Initial Purchase Price,
Buyer shall pay to Sellers interest at the Base Rate on the amount due to
Sellers

  

   

     
   

  



  

under Section 1.4 or 1.5 for the period from Closing to the date on which
repayment is made to Sellers of the amount due.

  



  

If any party fails to pay to the other, on the due date, any amount due under
Section 1.4 or 1.5, that party shall pay interest on the amount so due at the
Default Rate for the period from the due date to the date of actual payment.

  



  

 **1.9** Transfer and assumption of Inter-company amounts at Closing

  

 ** **

  

At Closing:

  



  

(a) With respect to each HI Payable, Sellers agree at Closing to (i) transfer
to Buyer, or to a member of Buyers Group designated by Buyer, all of such
Sellers right and interest in such HI Payable, and (ii) cause each other
member of Sellers Group to which any HI Payable is owed, at Closing to
transfer to Buyer, or to a member of Buyers Group designated by Buyer, all
of such Sellers Group members right and interest in each such HI Payable,
in the amount and currency in which such HI Payable is denominated for a
consideration equal to the amount of such HI Payable (the obligations in
respect of which amount shall be satisfied in the manner set out in paragraph
(c) and (d) below). Buyer agrees to accept such transfer and to cause the
designated member of Buyers Group to accept such transfer.

  



  

(b) With respect to each HI Receivable, Buyer agrees to assume (or cause a
member of Buyers Group designated by Buyer to assume) at Closing the
obligations of the member of Sellers Group that is the obligor of the
relevant HI Receivable (the " _Sellers  Group Obligor_"), and procure the
release of each Sellers Group Obligor from such obligations, in the amount
and currency in which such HI Receivable is denominated. Sellers shall agree
(and shall cause such other members of Sellers Group which are Sellers
Group Obligors to agree) to such assumption (by way of novation) of the
relevant HI Receivable.

  



  

(c) As between the Sellers Group and the Buyers Group, the consideration
for the transfer of the HI Payables to Buyer or a member of Buyers Group
designated by Buyer, in accordance with paragraph (a) above shall, to the
extent possible, be satisfied by the assumption of the obligations in respect
of HI Receivables in accordance with paragraph (b) above in an amount equal
to the amount of the HI Payables.

  



  

(d) If, at Closing, the aggregate amount of the HI Payables exceeds the
aggregate amount of the HI Receivables, the amount of such excess shall be a
reduction in the Base Purchase Price (and accordingly the Consideration) and
Buyer (as agent for the relevant members of the Buyers Group) shall pay to
Sellers (as agent for the relevant members of

  

   

     
   

  



  

the Sellers Group) at Closing an amount in cash equal to the excess by way
of the balance of the consideration for the transfer of the HI Payables
pursuant to paragraph (a) above. Accordingly, and for the avoidance of
doubt, the cash amount payable for such excess shall be satisfied by a
portion of the amount otherwise payable under Sections 1.2 and 1.5 and shall
not cause an increase or decrease in the aggregate cash price payable under
this _Schedule 2.2_.

  



  

(e) If, at Closing, the aggregate amount of the HI Receivables exceeds the
aggregate amount of the HI Payables, the amount of such excess shall be an
increase in the Base Purchase Price (and accordingly the Consideration). The
obligation to pay such an increase in the Consideration shall be satisfied by
the assumption (in accordance with paragraph (b) above by Buyer (or such
member of Buyers Group designated by Buyer)) of the obligations in respect
of HI Receivables of an amount equal to such excess. For the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing shall not cause an increase or decrease in the aggregate
cash price payable under this _Schedule 2.2_.

  



  

(f) Buyer and Seller agree to do, and to procure that respectively members of
the Buyers Group and Sellers Group do, such other acts and things as may be
