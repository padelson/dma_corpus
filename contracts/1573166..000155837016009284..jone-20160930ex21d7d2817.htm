 \t\t\t\t 2. \t\t\tPurchase and Sale; Purchase Price. At the Closing, and
upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, (a) Seller
agrees to sell and convey to Buyer the Properties, and (b) Buyer agrees to
purchase, accept and pay for the Properties and to assume the Assumed
Obligations. In consideration for the sale of the Properties, Buyer will pay
to Seller the purchase price of ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX MILLION FOUR HUNDRED
EIGHTY-FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY-THREE DOLLARS ($136,485,293.00),
adjusted as set forth herein (the "Purchase Price"), in immediately available
funds at Closing (pursuant to wire transfer instructions designated in advance
by Seller to Buyer in writing) for the account of Seller. Within two (2)
Business Days after the later of (i) the Execution Date or (ii) the execution
and delivery of the Escrow Agreement by all parties thereto, Buyer will
deliver an earnest money deposit to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(the "Escrow Agent") equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the unadjusted Purchase
Price (the "Deposit"), and such amount, including any interest or other
amounts earned thereon and less any disbursements therefrom in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement (the "Escrow Fund"), is to be held in accordance with the
terms of an Escrow Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit E attached
hereto (the "Escrow Agreement"). The Parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent
to release the funds in accordance with Section 11.3 and the Escrow Agreement.
The Purchase Price will be adjusted as set forth below in this Section 2.

 \t\t\t\t 2.1. \t\t\t

 \t\t|

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\tTitle and Environmental Defects. The Purchase Price will be (a)
decreased only for those uncured Title Defects and uncured Environmental
Defects that exceed, individually, the respective Individual Defect Thresholds
and, collectively with all other uncured Title Defects and Environmental
Defects that exceed the applicable Individual Defect Thresholds, the Aggregate
Defect Threshold and (b) increased for Title Benefits, in each case, in
accordance with this Section 2.1. Buyer may deliver to Seller, on or before
the Defect Notice Date, one or more Defect Notices (each meeting all of the
requirements set forth in the definition thereof) specifying each defect
associated with the Properties that Buyer asserts constitutes a Title Defect
or an Environmental Defect. Any matters that may otherwise constitute Title
Defects or Environmental Defects, but of which Seller has not been notified by
Buyer pursuant to a valid Defect Notice by the Defect Notice Date, shall be
deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes. The term "Defect Notice
Date" means 5:00 p.m. Central Time on September 15, 2016. All adjustments to
the Purchase Price based on Title Defects and/or any breach of the special
warranty contained in the Assignment (other than with respect to a Lien l
(other than a Permitted Encumbrance) created by Seller that is liquidated in
amount and constitutes a breach of Seller's special warranty title contained
in the Assignment) will be based on the Allocated Values attributable to the
affected Properties. The defect amount with respect to a Title Defect shall
be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
defect amount for Title Defects hereunder, or for which Buyer otherwise
receives credit in the calculation of the Purchase

Price. In no event will the aggregate amount of Title Defect adjustments
exceed the Allocated Value of a Property. Subject to Sectionº 2.1.10 and
Section 2.1.11, if the aggregate of all adjustments to the Purchase Price
required under this Agreement in respect of a Property would equal or exceed
the entire Allocated Value of such Property, then at Seller's option (which
option must be exercised by delivering written notice to Seller at least five
(5) Business Days prior to Closing) and in lieu of such adjustments, Seller
may exclude such Property from the purchase and sale hereunder, and such
Property shall be an Excluded Asset and the Purchase Price will be reduced in
an amount equal to the entire Allocated Value of such Property, and any Title
Defects or Environmental Defects asserted as to such Property will not be
considered for purposes of determining whether the Aggregate Defect Threshold
has been met. Upon timely delivery of a Defect Notice of a Title Defect or
Environmental Defect under this Section 2.1, Buyer and Seller will in good
faith negotiate the validity of the claim and the amount of any adjustment to
the Purchase Price using the following criteria:

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t(a) No single Title Defect or Title Benefit with respect to: (i) a
Well shall be taken into account unless the value of such defect or benefit is
determined to be more than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00), and
(ii) a Lease shall be taken into account unless the value of such defect or
benefit is determined to be more than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00); and
(b) no single Environmental Defect shall be taken into account unless the
value of such defect is determined to be more than One Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($100,000.00) (each such amount an "Individual Defect Threshold"), in
which event the full amount of such defect or benefit shall be taken into
account from the first Dollar. For the avoidance of doubt, the value of any
single Environmental Defect that affects multiple Properties shall be
aggregated for purposes of determining whether the applicable Individual
Defect Threshold has been met. 

---|---|---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 2.1.2 \t\t\t

 \t\t|

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\tNo adjustment will be made to the Purchase Price for either uncured
Title Defects or for uncured Environmental Defects unless the total of all
such uncured Title Defects that, subject to Section 2.1.1, exceed the
Individual Defect Threshold for Title Defects and all such uncured
Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual Defect Threshold for
Environmental Defects exceeds three and one-half percent (3½%) of the
unadjusted Purchase Price in the aggregate (the "Aggregate Defect Threshold").
In the event that the aggregate of such uncured Title Defects and such uncured
Environmental Defects exceed the Aggregate Defect Threshold after offsetting
any Title Benefits pursuant to Section 2.1.9, the adjustment to the Purchase
Price shall only be for the amount by which all such Title Defects and
Environmental Defects (in excess of such Title Benefits) exceed the Aggregate
Defect Threshold. Subject to Section 2.1.10 and Section 2.1.11, with respect
to any Environmental Defects for which an adjustment greater than the
Allocated Value of the affected Property is claimed in good faith in Buyer's
Defect Notice, at either Party's option (which option must be exercised by
delivering written notice to the other Party at least two (2)

Business Days prior to Closing), such Party may elect to exclude the affected
Property from the transactions contemplated hereby, and such Property shall be
an Excluded Asset and the Purchase Price will be reduced by the Allocated
Value of the affected Property.

 \t\t\t\t 2.1.3 \t\t\t

 \t\t|

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\tIf the adjustment is based on Seller owning a Net Revenue Interest in
a Lease or Well which is less than the Net Revenue Interest shown on Exhibit A
for such Lease or Well, then the downward adjustment shall be calculated by
multiplying the Allocated Value for such Lease or Well on Exhibit A by a
fraction, the numerator of which is an amount equal to the Net Revenue
Interest shown on Exhibit A for such Lease or Well, less the Net Revenue
Interest for such Lease or Well to which Seller is actually entitled taking
the applicable Title Defect into account, and the denominator of which is the
Net Revenue Interest shown on Exhibit A for such Lease or Well. 

---|---|---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 2.1.4 \t\t\t

 \t\t|

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\tIf the adjustment is based on Seller owning a Working Interest in a
Well which is larger than the Working Interest shown for such Well on Exhibit
A, but without a proportionate increase in the Net Revenue Interest for such
Well, then the downward adjustment shall be calculated by determining the
effective Net Revenue Interest that results from such larger Working Interest,
determining what the Net Revenue Interest would be using such effective Net
Revenue Interest and the Working Interest shown for such Property on Exhibit A
and then calculating the adjustment in the manner set forth herein for
adjustment based on reductions in the Net Revenue Interest. 

---|---|---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 2.1.5 \t\t\t

 \t\t|

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\tIf the adjustment is based on Seller owning fewer Net Acres in a Lease
than those shown on Exhibit A for such Lease, then the downward adjustment
shall be calculated by multiplying the Allocated Value shown for such Lease on
Exhibit A by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Net Acres
shown on Exhibit A for such Lease, less the number of Net Acres in such Lease
to which Seller is actually entitled taking the applicable Title Defect into
account, and the denominator of which is the number of Net Acres shown on
Exhibit A for such Lease. 

---|---|---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 2.1.6 \t\t\t

 \t\t|

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\tIf the adjustment is based on a Lien or other monetary charge upon a
Lease or Well (other than a Permitted Encumbrance) that is liquidated in
amount, then the downward adjustment is the lesser of the amount necessary to
remove such Lien or other monetary charge from the affected Lease or the
Allocated Value of the affected Lease or Well, provided, however, that in the
event the monetary charge upon Seller's interest in such Lease or Well exceeds

is that portion for which Buyer would be liable after Closing of an amount
equal to the lowest cost reasonably necessary for the remediation or
correction or to otherwise cure such Environmental Defect (including all costs
related to remediation, restoration, clean up, correction, removal, reporting,
investigation and monitoring and any related criminal or civil fines,
penalties and liabilities) in a manner that does not materially interfere with
the use or operation of such Lease and that is consistent with applicable
Environmental Law and prudent industry practices.

 \t\t\tIf the adjustment is based on an obligation, burden, or liability upon
a Lease or Well for which Buyer's economic detriment is not liquidated but can
be estimated with reasonable certainty, then, subject to the other provisions
hereof, the downward adjustment is the amount equal to the lesser of the
amount of such economic detriment or the Allocated Value of such Lease or
Well.

to: (a) a larger Net Revenue Interest than that set forth on Exhibit A for
such Well or Lease; or (b) a greater number of Net Acres than the number of
Net Acres set forth on Exhibit A for such Lease (each, a "Title Benefit"),
then Seller shall notify Buyer of such Title Benefit in writing on or before
the Defect Notice Date, which notice shall include a description of such Title
Benefit, the Dollar value that Seller asserts is attributable to such Title
Benefit and Seller's method of calculating such amount, together with all data
and information in Seller's possession or control reasonably necessary for
Buyer to verify the existence of the alleged Title Benefit. Seller shall be
deemed to have conclusively waived any Title Benefit of which Seller fails to
notify Buyer in the manner and by the date specified in the preceding
sentence. The upward adjustment to the Purchase Price in respect of each
Title Benefit shall be determined using the same principles as provided in
this Section 2.1 with respect to Title Defects and any such adjustment shall
only be to the extent that the aggregate of all Title Benefits that exceed the
Individual Defect Thresholds exceed the Aggregate Defect Threshold.

 \t\t\tIf a Title Defect or an Environmental Defect is reasonably susceptible
of being cured or remediated, as applicable, then Seller will provide notice
to Buyer on or before five (5) days prior to the Closing Date stating whether
or not Seller will attempt to cure such Title Defect or Environmental Defect.
If Seller provides notice electing to attempt to cure such Title Defect or
Environmental Defect, then Seller will have the right, but not the obligation,
to attempt to cure such defect for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days
following the Closing (the "Cure Period"), provided, that such election shall
not waive or be deemed to waive Seller's right to dispute the existence of
such alleged defect or the Purchase Price adjustment asserted with respect
thereto. With respect to any alleged Title Defect Seller elects to cure or to
which a Defect Dispute relates, (a) the Properties affected by such alleged
Title Defect shall be conveyed to Buyer at Closing, (b) subject to the

applicable Individual Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Defect Threshold, the
Purchase Price at Closing shall be reduced by the amount asserted by Buyer in
the applicable Defect Notice attributable to such alleged Title Defect, and
(c) Buyer shall pay to the Escrow Agent the amount set forth in Section
2.1.10(b), such amount to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement. After Closing, Buyer shall provide (or cause to be provided) to
Seller and its representatives reasonable access to the Records during the
Cure Period in connection with Seller's efforts to cure such alleged Title
Defects. With respect to any alleged Environmental Defect Seller elects to
cure or to which a Defect Dispute relates, (x) the Properties affected by such
alleged Environmental Defect shall be retained by Seller at Closing, (y)
subject to the applicable Individual Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Defect
Threshold, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the
applicable Property, and (z) Buyer shall pay to the Escrow Agent the amount
set forth in Section 2.1.10(y), such amount to be held by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. If, at the expiration of the Cure Period,
Seller has cured or partially cured any such Title Defect or Environmental
Defect, then Buyer and Seller shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Seller
an amount equal to the value of the Title Defect or Environmental Defect (or
in the event of a partial cure, the portion of the value of such Title Defect
or Environmental Defect that corresponds to such partial cure), as applicable,
that has been cured and Seller shall execute and deliver to Buyer an
assignment (substantially in the same form as the Assignment) of any
Properties affected by a cured Environmental Defect. If Seller fails to cure
or partially cure any Environmental Defects or Title Defects such that the
aggregate of any remaining amounts of all adjustments to the Purchase Price
that Buyer in good faith asserts to remain with respect to such Title Defects
and Environmental Defects exceeds the Allocated Value of the affected
Property, then Seller or Buyer may elect to exclude such Property from the
transactions contemplated hereby (or, if already conveyed to Buyer, Buyer will
execute and deliver to Seller an assignment (in substantially the same form as
the Assignment) of such Property), such Property shall be an Excluded Asset
and the Parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer an amount
equal to the amount previously paid to the Escrow Agent with respect to such
Title Defects and Environmental Defects for such Property. If the Parties
dispute whether or the extent to which a Title Defect or Environmental Defect
has been cured or the amount due to the Party as a result thereof, then the
matter shall be resolved in the manner described in Section 2.1.11, and the
amounts held by the Escrow Agent that are attributable to such Title Defect or
Environmental Defect shall not be released until such matter is finally
resolved in accordance therewith.

by the end of the Cure Period). If, at the Closing (or, with respect to any
Title Defects or Environmental Defects that Seller has elected to cure, at the
end of the Cure Period), there is still a dispute between Seller and Buyer
involving: (a) Title Defects, (b) Title Benefits, (c) Environmental Defects,
(d) the cure of a Title Defect or Environmental Defect, or (e) the value
attributable to Title Defects, Title Benefits, or Environmental Defects or the
adjustment to the Purchase Price with respect thereto (collectively, "Defect
Disputes"), then Seller and Buyer shall each have until the date that is
ninety (90) days after the end of the Cure Period to submit the dispute to an
expert for determination as provided in this Section 2.1.11 following written
notice from one Party to the other Party that such Party is initiating dispute
resolution in accordance with this Section 2.1.11, such notice to describe in
reasonable detail the nature and specifics of the dispute. Buyer, with
respect to Title Defects and Environmental Defects, and Seller, with respect
to Title Benefits, shall be deemed to have conclusively waived any unresolved
Title Defect or Environmental Defect dispute, or any unresolved Title Benefit
dispute, with respect to which the applicable Party has not delivered a
Dispute Notice to the other Party on or before the date that is ninety (90)
days after the end of the Cure Period. The applicable disputes shall be
consolidated to the extent practicable and resolved through the binding
dispute resolution process set forth in this Section 2.1.11. Title dispute
matters to be resolved under this Section 2.1.11 shall be submitted to a
mutually agreed lawyer in the energy industry in the State of Oklahoma with
not less than seven (7) years' experience in oil and gas title issues selected
by Seller and Buyer, and environmental dispute matters to be resolved under
this Section 2.1.11 shall be submitted to a mutually agreed, suitably
qualified environmental expert in the energy industry with experience in
environmental issues selected by Seller and Buyer (each such title attorney or
environmental expert hereinafter, a "Consultant"). In the event Seller and
Buyer are unable to agree on a single Consultant within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the initiating notice, Seller will appoint one Consultant and Buyer
will appoint one Consultant within twenty (20) Business Days thereafter and
the two Consultants so appointed will appoint a third Consultant within thirty
(30) days after the second Consultant is appointed. If the two Consultants are
unable to agree on a third Consultant within such thirty (30) day period, then
a third Consultant shall be selected by the AAA office in Dallas, Texas
consistent with the selection criteria set forth in this Section and with due
regard given to input from the Parties and the other Consultants. Any
Consultant appointed pursuant to this Agreement (y) shall not have worked as
an employee of or performed other material work for any Party or its
Affiliates within the preceding five (5) year period or have any financial
interest in the dispute (except publicly traded securities with respect to any
Party or its Affiliates), and (z) shall agree in writing to keep strictly
confidential the specifics and existence of the dispute as well as all
proprietary records of the Parties reviewed by the Consultants in the process
of resolving such dispute. The mutually agreed Consultant

or the three Consultants so appointed will resolve such matter. The costs and
expenses of each Consultant shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Seller and
fifty percent (50%) by Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall each present to the
Consultant(s), with a simultaneous copy to the other Party, a single written
statement of its position on the defect, benefit, or dispute in question,
together with a copy of this Agreement and any supporting material that such
Party desires to furnish, not later than ten (10) Business Days after
appointment of the Consultant(s). In making their determination, the
Consultant(s) shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement and, without any
additional or supplemental submittals by either Buyer or Seller, may consider
available legal and industry matters as in their opinion are necessary or
appropriate to make a proper determination. Within sixty (60) days following
the submission of such written statements to the Consultant(s), applying the
principles set forth in this Section 2.1, the Consultant(s) shall make a
determination of the matter submitted based solely on the single written
statement of each Party. The decision of the Consultant(s) shall be in
writing and conclusive and binding on Seller and Buyer and shall be
enforceable against the Parties in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Within five (5) days of the final decision by the Consultant(s), Buyer and
Seller shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Seller and/or Buyer, as
applicable, an amount equal to the amounts awarded to each Party by the
Consultant(s). Seller shall execute and deliver to Buyer an assignment
(substantially in the same form as the Assignment) of any Properties affected
by an applicable Environmental Defect; provided, however, that if the
Consultant(s) determines the Purchase Price adjustment that would have been
attributable to any Environmental Defects or Title Defects in the aggregate
exceeds the Allocated Value of the affected Property, then Seller or Buyer may
elect to exclude such Property from the transactions contemplated hereby (or,
if already conveyed to Buyer, Buyer will execute and deliver to Seller an
assignment (in substantially the same form as the Assignment) of such
Property) and such Property shall be an Excluded Asset. The Consultant(s)
shall act as experts for the limited purpose of determining the specific title
or environmental dispute presented to them, shall not act as arbitrators,
shall not consider, hear or decide any matters except the specific title or
environmental disputes presented to them and shall not award legal fees,
damages, interest or penalties (including punitive or exemplary damages, lost
profits, consequential, special or indirect damages) to either Buyer or
Seller. The Consultants shall not have the powers of the arbitrators under
Section 13 and shall not consider any matters that are Arbitrable Disputes.
In addition, the Consultant(s) shall agree in writing to keep strictly
confidential the specifics and existence of any matters submitted as well as
all proprietary records of the Parties, if any, reviewed by the Consultant(s)
in the process of resolving such disputes.

notifications of a preferential purchase right, right of first refusal or
other agreement which gives a Third Party a right to purchase a Property (or

 \t\t\tIf, as of the Closing Date, a holder of a PPR has notified Seller that
it elects to exercise its PPR with respect to the Properties to which its PPR
applies (determined by and in accordance with the agreement under which the
PPR arises), then the Properties covered by that PPR will not be sold to Buyer
(subject to the remaining provisions in this Section 2.2), and the Purchase
Price will be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Properties subject to such
PPR. Seller shall be entitled to all proceeds paid by any Person exercising a
PPR prior to Closing. If, as of the Closing Date, the PPR has not been
exercised or waived and the time for exercising such PPR has not expired, the
Properties covered by that PPR will be sold to Buyer subject to any rights of
the holder of the PPR and no adjustment to the Purchase Price will be made
with respect thereto and, in the event the holder of any such PPR thereafter
exercises such PPR, Buyer will comply with all of the terms thereof and, as
may be required by the terms of the PPR, convey the applicable Properties to
the holder of the PPR and be entitled to the proceeds paid by such holder with
respect thereto. If, as of the Closing Date, a holder of a Required Consent
has not yet delivered such Required Consent and the time for granting such
consent has not expired, then the Properties covered by that Required Consent
will not be conveyed to Buyer at Closing and the Purchase Price will be
reduced by the Allocated Value of the Properties (or portions thereof) subject

allowable oil or other liquid Hydrocarbons owned by Seller in storage above
the pipeline connection at the Effective Time that is credited to the
Properties in accordance with gauging and other customary industry procedures,
such value to be the actual price paid or, if not yet sold, the current market
price at the Effective Time, less gravity adjustments deducted by the
purchaser of such oil or other liquid Hydrocarbons; (b) the value of all

such value to be the current market price at the Effective Time; (c) the
amount of all expenditures incurred in accordance with the relevant operating
or unit agreement, in connection with the ownership, operation and maintenance
of the Properties (including capital expenditures, rentals, overhead,
royalties, prepayments, operating, drilling and completion costs and other
charges and expenses billed under applicable operating agreements and Taxes)

Effective Time that are attributable to the Properties; (e) the amount of any
Taxes paid or borne by Seller (including as a reduction in proceeds received)
for which Buyer is responsible under Section 5.9; (f) the Overhead Costs; and
(g) any other amount provided for in this Agreement or agreed upon by Buyers
and Seller; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, there shall be no adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.4 for any
amounts spent or costs incurred by Seller (i) pursuant to Section 5.8 or (ii)

the best information available to Seller, a statement (the "Closing
Statement") setting forth each adjustment to the Purchase Price required under

accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and deliver to Buyer, a
post-closing statement setting forth a detailed calculation of all final
adjustments to the Purchase Price which takes into account all such
adjustments provided in this Agreement (the "Final Statement"). If Buyer
disputes any items in or the accuracy and completeness of the Final Statement,
then as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30)
days after its receipt of the Final Statement, Buyer will deliver to Seller a
written exception report containing any changes Buyer proposes to be made to
the Final Statement. If Buyer fails to deliver such exception report to
Seller within that period, then the Final Statement as delivered by Seller
will be deemed to be true and correct, binding upon and not subject to dispute
by either Party. If Buyer delivers a timely exception report, then as soon as
reasonably practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after
Seller receives Buyer's exception report, the Parties will meet and undertake
to agree on the final post-Closing adjustments to the Purchase Price. If the
Parties fail to agree on the final post-Closing adjustments within sixty (60)
days after Seller's receipt of Buyer's exception report, either Buyer or
Seller will be entitled to submit the dispute for resolution by the Accounting
Referee. The cost of the Accounting Referee shall be paid fifty percent (50%)
by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall each
present to the Accounting Referee, with a simultaneous copy to the other
Party, a single written statement of its position on the dispute in question,
together with a copy of this Agreement, the Closing Statement, the proposed
Final Statement, and Buyer's written exception report and any supporting
material that such Party desires to furnish, not later than ten (10) Business
Days after appointment of the Accounting Referee. In making its
determination, the Accounting Referee shall be bound by the terms of this
Agreement and, without any additional or supplemental submittals by either
Party, may consider such other accounting and financial standards matters as
in its opinion are necessary or appropriate to make a proper determination.
The Parties shall direct the Accounting Referee to resolve the disputes within
thirty (30) days after receipt of the written statements submitted for review
and to render a decision in writing based upon such written statements. The
Accounting Referee shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific Final Statement dispute presented

upon resolution of such adjustments by the Accounting Referee, as the case may
be, the Final Statement (as adjusted pursuant to such agreement or resolution

Parties, without right of appeal, and the aggregate amount due to either Buyer

Wells), during the period from the Execution Date to the Defect Notice Date,
Seller will use Seller's reasonable efforts to cause the operators of the
Wells to grant Buyer access for Buyer to conduct, at its sole cost and
expense, such examinations and investigations as it may choose to conduct with
respect to the Properties in order to determine whether any Environmental
Defects exist; provided that Buyer shall not conduct any sampling, boring
drilling or invasive activities or any Phase II environmental investigations
or examinations with respect to any of the Properties without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent may be granted or withheld by Seller
in its sole discretion; provided, however, that if Buyer reasonably requests
access to conduct a Phase II environmental investigation or examination and
Seller denies Buyer consent to conduct such Phase II environmental
investigation or examination, then Buyer may, in its sole election, elect to
exclude such affected Property from the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement (and, other than with respect to this sentence, such Properties
shall be deemed "Excluded Assets" hereunder), and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such Properties excluded and deemed Excluded
Assets hereunder. The following covenants shall survive Closing or
termination of this Agreement:

examination or investigation of a Property and coordinate the conduct of such
examination or investigation with Seller's representatives (and Seller or its
designee shall have the right to accompany Buyer and its representatives
whenever on site at any Property), (b) such examination or investigation shall
be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner not to unreasonably
interfere with the normal operation of the Properties or the business of
Seller, and (c) Buyer shall, and shall cause all of its representatives to,
comply with all applicable Laws and abide by Seller's and the operator's
safety rules, regulations and operating policies while conducting its due
diligence evaluation of the Properties and, to the extent required by any
Third-Party operator, execute and deliver any required bonding agreement of
such Third-Party operator or maintain insurance as may be required by any

agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless all of the Seller Indemnified
Parties from and against any and all liabilities, damages, costs, losses and
expenses arising from or in any way related to the access afforded to Buyer
hereunder or the activities of Buyer or any of its employees, agents,

concurrent or comparative negligence, strict liability or other fault or
violation of Law of or by a member of the Seller Indemnified Parties,
excepting only liabilities actually resulting on the account of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Seller Indemnified Parties. This

 \t\t\tIndemnification Procedure. If any indemnified party discovers or
otherwise becomes aware of an indemnification claim arising under this
Agreement, such party will give written notice to the indemnifying Party,
including the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for
its claim and an estimate of the amount, if reasonably estimable, of the
Liabilities that have been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party, and
may thereafter exercise any remedies available to such indemnified party under
this Agreement; provided, however, the failure of any indemnified party to
give notice as provided herein will not relieve the indemnifying Party of any
obligations hereunder, to the extent the indemnifying Party is not materially
prejudiced thereby. In the event that the claim for indemnification is based
upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, the claim notice shall specify the representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or breached. Further, promptly
after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of written notice of the
commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which a claim for
indemnification may be made against any indemnifying Party, the indemnified
party will give written notice to the indemnifying Party of the commencement
of such action, accompanied by a copy of all papers, if any, served with
respect to the action or proceeding; provided, however, the failure of any
indemnified party to give notice as provided herein will not relieve the
indemnifying Party of any obligations hereunder, to the extent the
indemnifying Party is not materially prejudiced thereby.

 \t\t\tDefense. If any action is brought against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in and to assume the
defense thereof to the extent that it may wish, and after notice from the
indemnifying Party to such indemnified party of the indemnifying Party's
election to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying Party shall not be
liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof unless the
indemnifying Party has failed to assume and diligently prosecute the defense
of such claim. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the
indemnified party will be entitled to select its own counsel and assume the
defense of any action brought against it if the indemnifying Party fails to
assume or diligently prosecute such defense, the expenses of such defense to
be paid by the indemnifying Party. As a condition to the indemnifying Party's
obligations hereunder, the indemnified party will in good faith cooperate with
and assist the indemnifying Party in the prosecution or defense of such
indemnified claim at no unreasonable expense to the indemnified party. No
indemnifying Party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to a claim either (a) without the consent of the
indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or (b)
unless such judgment or settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release
from all liability with respect to such claim. No

 \t\t\tNo claim of Buyer or the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section
10.2.1 shall be made hereunder (and Seller shall not be required to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnified Parties) unless the amount of such claim exceeds an

for any matter (including any breach of the other representations or
warranties under Section 3) which constitutes a Title Defect or an
Environmental Defect. Claims for Title Defects or Environmental Defects,

if either Buyer or Seller elects to proceed with the Closing with actual
knowledge by such Party of any failure of any condition to be satisfied in its

 \t\t\tAny claim for indemnity under this Section 10 by any indemnified party

such breach causes any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6 not
to be satisfied (or, if prior to Closing, is of such a magnitude or effect
that it

that in the case of a breach that is capable of being cured, Seller shall have
until the earlier of the Outside Date and the date that is ten (10) days
following receipt of such notice to attempt to cure the breach and the
termination under this Section 11.1.2 shall not become effective unless Seller

 \t\t

 \t\t\tprovided, however, neither Seller nor Buyer shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1.2 or Section 11.1.3 if such

 \t\t\tIf this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 11.1.3
and Seller has performed or is ready, willing and able to perform all of its
agreements and covenants contained herein which are to be performed or
observed at or prior to Closing, then subject to Seller's exercise of its
rights under Section 11.3.4, Buyer and Seller shall instruct the Escrow Agent
to pay to Seller the Deposit as liquidated damages as Seller's sole and
exclusive remedy for any breach or failure to perform by Buyer under this
Agreement. Seller and Buyer agree that, in the event Seller receives the
Deposit as liquidated damages pursuant to this Section 11.3.2, the amount of
the Deposit is a reasonable estimate due to the difficulty and inconvenience
of measuring actual damages and the uncertainty thereof, and Seller and Buyer
agree that such amount would be a reasonable estimate of Seller's loss in the
event of any such breach or failure to perform by Buyer. Upon such
termination, Seller shall be free immediately to enjoy all rights of ownership
of the Properties and to sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of the
Properties to any Person without any restriction under this Agreement.

agreements and covenants contained herein which are to be performed or
observed at or prior to Closing, then, at Buyer's election, either (a) Buyer
and Seller shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the Deposit to Buyer and
Buyer shall be entitled to seek monetary damages available at Law from Seller
for Seller's applicable breach of this Agreement (limited to 15% of the
unadjusted Purchase Price) or (b) pursuant to Section 11.3.4, the Deposit will
remain in escrow with the Escrow Agent and Buyer shall be entitled to seek
specific performance as provided in Section 11.3.4.

performed or is ready, willing and able to perform all of its agreements and
covenants contained herein which are to be performed or observed at or prior
to Closing, then such Party shall be entitled to specific performance of this
Agreement, it being specifically agreed that monetary damages will not be
sufficient to compensate such Party if such Party determines the same in its
sole discretion. If a Party elects to seek specific performance of this
Agreement, the Deposit shall be held by the Escrow Agent until a non-
appealable final judgment or award on such Party's claim for specific

Agent to distribute the Deposit as provided in the judgment or award resolving
the specific performance claim or shall be applied as provided in Section 2.

 \t\t\tIf this Agreement terminates for reasons other than those set forth in
Section 11.1.2(i) or Section 11.1.3, then (a) Buyer and Seller shall instruct
the Escrow Agent to pay the Deposit to Buyer, free of any claims by Seller or
any other Person with respect thereto, and (b) except as otherwise provided in
Section 11.3.6, neither Party shall have any further liability hereunder of
any nature whatsoever to the other Party.

 \t\t\tIf this Agreement terminates for any reason other than those set forth
in Section 11.1.1, Section Error! Reference source not found.11.1.3, or
Section 11.1.4, and Seller directly or indirectly receives an indication of
interest for a Superior Transaction prior to the date of termination of this
Agreement and enters into an agreement representing a Superior Transaction
within six (6) months of such termination (whether or not with the party
submitting such indication of interest), then unless Buyer has terminated
under Section 11.1.2(i) and elected to enforce its rights under Section
11.3.3, Seller shall, upon the closing of the transaction contemplated by such
agreement, pay to Buyer the amount of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) as
a break-up fee constituting liquidated damages and as Buyer's sole and
exclusive remedy in connection with any such termination in lieu of all other
recourse against Seller including monetary damages and specific performance.
Seller and Buyer agree that, in the event Buyer receives such break-up fee
pursuant to this Section 11.3.6, (i) such amount is a reasonable estimate due
to the difficulty and inconvenience of measuring actual damages and the
uncertainty thereof, and Seller and Buyer agree that such amount would be a
reasonable estimate of Buyer's loss and (ii) Buyer shall not be entitled to
seek the remedies provided for in Section 11.3.3 (other than right to receive
the return of the Deposit). If this Agreement terminates for any reason other
than those set forth in Section 11.1.1, Section Error! Reference source not
found.11.1.3, or Section 11.1.4, the provisions of this Section 11.3.6 shall
survive termination of this Agreement.

 \t\t\t\t 12. \t\t\tDefault. If either Party fails to perform any material
obligation contained in this Agreement that is to be performed at or prior to
Closing, and Closing has not yet occurred, then the Party claiming default
will serve written notice to the other Party specifying the nature of such
default and demanding performance. If such a material default by Seller has
not been cured within the sooner of ten (10) days after receipt of such
default notice or the date specified in Section 11.1.5 above, and each of the
conditions contained in Section 7 has been either fulfilled in all material
respects or waived in writing (other than conditions pertaining to the
execution and delivery of documents and payment of monies by Buyer the
fulfillment of which is expressly provided to occur at the Closing, and
conditions not satisfied as a consequence of acts or omissions of Seller

provided in Section 11.3.3 by reason of such default, including termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 11. If such a material default by Buyer
has not been cured within the sooner of ten (10) days after receipt of such
default notice or the date specified in Section 11.1.5 above, and each of the
conditions contained in Section 6 has been either fulfilled in all material
respects or waived in writing (other than conditions pertaining to the
execution and delivery of documents the fulfillment of which is expressly
provided to occur at the Closing, and conditions not satisfied as a
consequence of acts or omissions of Buyer or its Affiliates), Seller will be
entitled to exercise all of the remedies provided in Section 11.3.1 by reason
of such default, including, without limitation, termination of this Agreement

Title Defects, Environmental Defects, or any cure relating thereto or any
Final Statement matters or other matters to be resolved by the Consultants or
Accounting Referee, which will be resolved as provided in Sections 2.1.11 or

 \t\t\tNegotiation. The Parties shall attempt to resolve any Arbitrable
Dispute promptly by negotiation between executives who have authority to
settle the controversy and who are at a comparable or higher level of
management than the persons who have been involved in the negotiation of this
Agreement. Either Party may give the other Party written notice of any
Arbitrable Dispute not resolved in the normal course of business. Within
fifteen (15) days after delivery of the notice, the receiving Party shall
submit to the other a written response. The notice and response shall include
(a) a statement of that Party's position and a summary of arguments supporting
that position, and (b) the name and title of the executive who will represent
that Party and of any other person who will accompany the executive. Within
thirty (30) days after delivery of the initial notice, the executives of both
Parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place, and thereafter
continue to meet as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to use their good
faith and reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve the Arbitrable Dispute.
All negotiations pursuant to this clause shall be confidential and shall be
treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of applicable
rules of evidence.

negotiation as provided in Section 13.1 within sixty (60) days after delivery
of the initial notice of negotiation, or if the Parties failed to meet within
thirty (30) days after delivery of such notice, the Parties shall endeavor to

arbitration in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules then in
effect (the "AAA Rules"), as supplemented to the extent necessary to determine
any procedural appeal questions by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the
United States Code); provided, however, that if there is no mediation under
Section 13.2 because any Party will not participate in mediation as provided
therein, the other Party may initiate arbitration at any time within sixty
(60) days following a Party's refusal to participate in mediation under such
Section. If there is any inconsistency between this Section 13 and the
Commercial Arbitration Rules or the Federal Arbitration Act, the terms of this

which arbitration has been initiated pursuant to this Agreement, such disputes
shall be consolidated into the first arbitration initiated pursuant to this
Agreement, provided that disputes regarding Title Defects, Environmental
Defects or any cure relating thereto or any Final Statement matters or other
matters to be resolved by the Consultants or Accounting Referee shall not be
consolidated with an Arbitrable Dispute under this Section 13.

 \t\t\tInitiation; Selection of Arbitrators. Arbitration may be initiated by
a Party ("Claimant") serving written notice on the other Party ("Respondent")
that the Claimant has referred the Arbitrable Dispute to binding arbitration.
Claimant's notice initiating binding arbitration must describe in reasonable
detail the nature of the Arbitrable Dispute and the facts and circumstances
relating thereto and identify the arbitrator Claimant has appointed.
Respondent shall respond to Claimant within thirty (30) days after receipt of
Claimant's notice, identifying the arbitrator Respondent has appointed. All
arbitrators must (a) be neutral parties who have never been officers,
directors or employees of the Parties or any of their Affiliates, or have
performed material work for either of the Parties or its Affiliates within the
preceding five (5) year period, and (b) agree in writing to keep strictly
confidential the specifics and existence of the dispute as well as all
proprietary records of the Parties reviewed by the arbitrators in the process
of resolving such dispute. Unless expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement arbitrators must have a formal education or training in the area of
dispute resolution and must have not less than seven (7) years' experience as
a lawyer in the energy industry with experience in exploration, contracts and
production issues. The two (2) arbitrators so chosen shall select a third
arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the second arbitrator has been
appointed, consistent with the selection criteria above and with due regard
given to input from the Parties. If either the Respondent fails to name its
Party-appointed arbitrator within the time permitted, or if the two
arbitrators are unable to agree on a third arbitrator within thirty (30) days
from the date the second arbitrator has been appointed, then the missing
arbitrator(s) shall be selected by the AAA with due regard given to the
selection criteria above and input from the Parties and other arbitrators.
The Parties acknowledge that each Party may have confidential communications
with its Party-appointed arbitrator concerning that arbitrator's selection.
The AAA shall select the missing arbitrator(s) not later than ninety (90)

days from initiation of arbitration. In the event the AAA should fail to
select the third arbitrator within ninety (90) days from initiation of
arbitration, then any Party may petition the Chief United States District
Judge for the Western District of Oklahoma, to select the third arbitrator.
Such selection shall be consistent with the selection criteria above and with
due regard given to input from the Parties and other arbitrators.

 \t\t\tProcedure. The arbitration shall proceed under the AAA Rules and
shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et. seq.
The arbitrators may, in their discretion, limit or expand discovery in any
arbitration proceeding. The Parties expressly covenant and agree to be bound
by the decision of the arbitrators as a final determination of the matter in
dispute, and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction. In rendering the award the arbitrators shall abide by (a) the
terms and conditions of this Agreement including, without limitation, any and
all restrictions, prohibitions or limitations on damages or remedies set forth
in this Agreement and (b) the law of the State of Oklahoma. The arbitrators
shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract from or alter in
any way the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrators may award equitable
relief, such as specific performance, as well as monetary damages for any
Party's breach of such Party's obligations under this Agreement, but in no
event may the arbitrators' award indirect, consequential, exemplary or
punitive damages or damages for lost profits.

 \t\t\tLocation and Timing. The arbitration shall take place in Oklahoma
City, Oklahoma and commence within sixty (60) days after the selection of the
third arbitrator, unless delayed by order of the arbitrators. The hearing
shall be based upon written position papers submitted by each Party within
fifteen (15) days after the selection of the third arbitrator, stating such
Party's proposed resolution of the dispute. The Parties and the arbitrators
should proceed diligently and in good faith in order that the award may be
made as promptly as possible. The arbitrators shall determine the Arbitrable
Disputes and render a final award on or before thirty (30) days following the

 \t\t\tExpenses; Award of Fees. The arbitration panel may apportion the
costs of arbitration between or among the Parties in such manner as it deems
reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the Arbitrable Dispute,
the conduct of the Parties and the result of arbitration. The arbitration
panel shall be empowered and directed to enter an award by default against any
Party to the arbitration who declines to pay when required by the arbitration
panel its share of such fees and costs. In addition, the arbitration panel,
shall be entitled to award to a Party such Party's reasonable attorney's fees
and expert fees, as determined by the arbitration panel considering those
factors mentioned in the first sentence of this Section 13.8, incurred in
connection with such Party's preparation for and participation in the
arbitration.

 \t\t\tLimitations. All statutes of limitations and defenses based upon
passage of time applicable to any Arbitrable Dispute (including any
counterclaim or setoff) shall be interrupted by the initiating of the dispute
resolution process pursuant to this Section 13 and suspended while any of the
dispute resolution processes described in this Section 13 is pending. The
terms hereof shall not create or limit any obligations of a Party to defend,
indemnify or hold harmless another Party against court proceedings or other
claims.

 \t\t\tEnforcement; Remedies. Prior to the appointment of the third
arbitrator a Party may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
seek temporary injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction,
provided that the Party seeking such relief shall (if arbitration has not
already been commenced) simultaneously commence the dispute resolution process
set forth in this Section 13. Such court-ordered relief shall not continue
more than ten (10) days after the appointment of the arbitrators and in no
event for longer than ninety (90) days. Except as provided in the Federal
Arbitration Act, the decision of the arbitrators shall be binding on and non-
appealable by the Parties. Each Party agrees that any arbitration award
against it may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction and that any
Party may authorize any such court to enter judgment on the arbitrators'
decisions. Without prejudice to such provisional remedies as may be available
under the jurisdiction of a court and in order to prevent irreparable harm,
the arbitral tribunal shall have full authority to grant provisional remedies
and to direct the parties to request that any court modify or vacate any
temporary or preliminary relief issued by such court or grant permanent
injunctive or other equitable relief.

 \t\t\tTime. This Agreement contains a number of dates and times by which
performance or the exercise of rights is due, and the Parties intend that each
and every such date and time be the firm and final date and time, as agreed.
For this reason, each Party hereby waives and relinquishes any right it might
otherwise have to challenge its failure to meet any performance or rights
election date applicable to it on the basis that its late action constitutes
substantial performance, to require the other Party to show prejudice, or on
any equitable grounds. Without limiting the foregoing, time is of the essence
of this Agreement. If the date specified in this Agreement for giving any
notice or taking any action is not a Business Day (or if the period during
which any notice is required to be given or any action taken expires on a date
which is not a Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking
such action (and the expiration date of such period during which notice is
required to be given or action taken) shall be the next day which is a
Business Day.

 \t\t\tWaiver of Jury Trial, Special Damages, etc. Each of Buyer and Seller
hereby knowingly, voluntarily, intentionally and irrevocably (a) waives, to
the maximum extent not prohibited by Law, any right it may have to a trial by
a jury in respect of any litigation based hereon, or directly or indirectly at
any time arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby or associated herewith, (b) waives, to the
maximum extent not prohibited by Law, any right it may have to claim or
recover in any such Proceeding any "Special Damages," as defined below, and
(c) acknowledges that it has been induced to enter into this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby by, among other things, the mutual waivers
and certifications contained in this Section, in each case it being the
express intent, understanding, and agreement of the Parties that such waivers
are to be given the fullest effect, notwithstanding the negligence (whether
sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other legal fault of any
Party. As used in this Section, "Special Damages" means all special,
exemplary, punitive, consequential, indirect, remote and speculative damages
(regardless of how named, and including loss of profit, loss of revenue, loss
of production or reserves, or any other incidental damages), but does not
include any payments or funds which a Party has expressly promised to pay or
deliver to the other Party or any claims of any Person for which one Party has
agreed to indemnify the other Party under this agreement.

 \t\t\tPossible Exchange. Each of Buyer and Seller reserve the right to
structure the transaction contemplated under the terms of this Agreement as a
non-simultaneous like-kind exchange pursuant to §1031 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, and its implementing regulations. In connection with
effectuating a non-simultaneous like-kind exchange, each Party reserves the
right, at or prior to Closing, to assign its rights under this Agreement to a
Qualified Intermediary (as that term is defined in §1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(v) of
the Treasury Regulations) or to a Qualified Exchange Accommodation Titleholder
(as that term is defined in Revenue Procedure 2000-37). In addition, should a
Party choose to structure the transaction provided under the terms of this
Agreement as a non-simultaneous like-kind exchange, the other Party agrees to
execute all documents reasonably necessary to effectuate the non-simultaneous
like-kind exchange.
