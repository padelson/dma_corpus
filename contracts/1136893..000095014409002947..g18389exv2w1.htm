As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Wisconsin shall cease. 

  

 (b) Georgia may at any time prior to the Effective Time change the method of effecting the combination (including by providing for the merger of Wisconsin directly into Georgia, with Georgia surviving the merger) if it determines in good faith that such change is necessary or desirable to address legal, commercial, regulatory or Tax concerns, and the parties shall cooperate with each other in good faith to implement such alternative method, including by entering into an appropriate amendment to this Agreement (to the extent such amendment only changes the method of effecting the business combination and does not substantively affect this Agreement or the rights and obligations of the parties or their respective shareholders hereunder); _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of Wisconsins shareholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration or the Tax treatment of either party pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) increase the conditionality or prevent the satisfaction of any condition to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 2.2 _Exchange of Shares_. (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates a letter of transmittal in customary form as prepared by Georgia and reasonably acceptable to Wisconsin (which shall specify, among other things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of Wisconsin Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.2(b)_. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing the number of whole 

    ##### 

 

  

shares of Georgia Common Stock to which such holder of Wisconsin Common Stock
shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of _Article I_ (after
taking into account all shares of Wisconsin Common Stock then held by such
holder), (ii) a check representing the amount of any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_, and (iii) a check representing the amount of any
dividends or distributions then payable pursuant to  _Section 2.2(b)(i)_,
and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of
fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to
holders of Certificates. Until so surrendered, each Certificate shall
represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares
and any dividends or distributions as contemplated by _Section 2.2(b)_. 

   

 (b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Georgia Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (i) the amount of any dividends or distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which have been declared by Wisconsin in respect of the shares of Wisconsin Common Stock after the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, (ii) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid, without any interest thereon, with respect to the whole shares of Georgia Common Stock represented by such Certificate, and (iii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender, with respect to shares of Georgia Common Stock represented by such Certificate. 

  

 (c) If any certificate representing shares of Georgia Common Stock is to be issued in, or any cash is paid to, a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance or payment thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " means any individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, joint venture, trust, unincorporated organization, other entity or group (as defined in the Exchange Act), including any Governmental Entity. 

  

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Wisconsin of the shares of Wisconsin Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Wisconsin Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Article II_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Georgia Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Georgia Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Georgia. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Georgia shall pay to each former shareholder of Wisconsin that otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share (after taking into account all shares of Wisconsin Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder) an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average, rounded to the nearest ten thousandth, of the closing sale prices of Georgia Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five full NYSE trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the Effective Date by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Georgia Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.4_. 

  

 (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Wisconsin as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be paid to Georgia. Any former shareholders of Wisconsin who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Georgia for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions payable in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ in respect of each share of Wisconsin Common Stock, as the case may be, such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Georgia, Merger Sub, Wisconsin, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Wisconsin Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. 

  

 (g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Georgia, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Georgia may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_. 

  

 2.3 _Withholding Rights_. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Georgia) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Georgia Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ hereof and any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Wisconsin Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Georgia, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Georgia, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Wisconsin Common Stock in respect of whom 

   ##### 

  

    

such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Georgia, as
the case may be.

Each Wisconsin Qualified Plan (A)(i) has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS with respect to such qualification or (ii) is a standardized prototype plan that is the subject of a favorable opinion letter from the IRS on which Wisconsin is entitled to rely, and (B) unless clause (A)(ii) applies, has been submitted to the IRS for a determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code or has a remedial amendment period that has not yet expired, and to the Knowledge of Wisconsin, there are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Wisconsin Qualified Plan or the tax-exempt status of its related trust. _Section 3.11(d)_ of the Wisconsin Disclosure Schedule identifies each trust funding any Wisconsin Plan which is intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, and each such trust meets such requirements and provides no disqualified benefits (as such term is defined in Code Section 4976(b)). None of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of Wisconsin, any other Person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which would reasonably be expected to subject any of the Wisconsin Plans or their related trusts, Wisconsin, any Wisconsin Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of Wisconsin, any Person that Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary has an obligation to indemnify, to any material Tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA. 

  

 (e) With respect to each Wisconsin Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, (i) there does not exist any accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived, and, (ii) except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect: (A) the fair market value of the assets of such Wisconsin Plan equals 

   ##### 

  

    

or exceeds the actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under such
Wisconsin Plan (whether or not vested) based on the assumptions used in the
latest annual actuarial report for such plan; (B) no reportable event within
the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice
requirement has not been waived has occurred; (C) all premiums to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ") have been timely paid in full;
(D) no liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of
ERISA has been or would reasonably be expected to be incurred by Wisconsin or
any Wisconsin Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates; and (E)
to the Knowledge of Wisconsin, the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to
terminate any such Wisconsin Plan and, to Wisconsins Knowledge, no condition
exists which would reasonably be expected to constitute grounds under Section
4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to
administer, any such Wisconsin Plan. 

  

 (f) (i) No Wisconsin Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ "); (ii) none of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan; and (iii) none of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred, during the last six years, any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full. To the Knowledge of Wisconsin, there does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary following the Effective Time, other than such liabilities that arise solely out of, or relate solely to, the Wisconsin Benefit Plans. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Wisconsin nor any Wisconsin Subsidiary, nor, to Wisconsins Knowledge, any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA. 

  

 (g) Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health, medical or other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and at no expense to Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries. 

  

 (h) Neither the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either alone or in conjunction with any other event (whether contingent or otherwise), (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any director, employee or independent contractor of Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such director, employee or independent contractor, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or compensation or (iv) result in any amount failing to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code. 

  

 (i) Each Wisconsin Benefit Plan and each Wisconsin Employment Agreement that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and any award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the 

   ##### 

  

    

Code, has been established and maintained in all material respects in
accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder. 

  

 (j) No labor organization or group of employees of Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary has made a pending demand for recognition or certification, and there are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding presently pending or, to Wisconsins Knowledge, threatened to be brought or filed, with the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations tribunal or authority. Each of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries is in material compliance with all applicable Laws and collective bargaining agreements respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages and hours and occupational safety and health. 

  

 3.12 _Compliance with Law; Permits_. (a) Wisconsin and each Wisconsin Subsidiary is, and at all times since the later of January 1, 2006 or its respective date of formation or organization has been, in material compliance with all applicable federal, state, local or foreign or provincial law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, injunction, decree, award, settlement or agency requirement of or undertaking to or agreement with any Governmental Entity, including common law (collectively, " _Laws_ " and each, a " _Law_ ") and is not in material default under or in violation of any applicable Laws. 

  

 (b) Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries are in possession of all material franchises, tariffs, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Permits_ ") necessary for Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the " _Wisconsin Permits_ "). All Wisconsin Permits are in full force and effect. Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries are not, and since January 1, 2006 have not been, in material violation or breach of, or default under, any Wisconsin Permit. 

  

 (c) This _Section 3.12_ does not relate to matters with respect to Taxes and Tax Returns (which are the subject of _Section 3.10_) and Employee Benefits (which are the subject of  _Section 3.11_). 

  

 3.13 _Certain Contracts_. (a) Except as set forth in the exhibit index to the Wisconsin 2008 10-K, or as permitted pursuant to _Section 5.2_ hereof or as set forth on _Section 3.13_ of the Wisconsin Disclosure Schedule, neither Wisconsin nor any Wisconsin Subsidiary is a party to or bound by (i) any Contract relating to the incurrence or guarantee of Indebtedness by Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary in an amount in excess in the aggregate of $25,000,000 (collectively, " _Wisconsin Instruments of Indebtedness_ "), (ii) any "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iii) any non-competition Contract, or any other agreement or obligation which purports to limit or restrict in any material respect (A) the ability of Wisconsin or its Subsidiaries to solicit customers or (B) the manner in which, or the localities in which, all or any portion of the business of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries or, following consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Georgia and the Georgia Subsidiaries, is or would be conducted, (iv) any Contract providing for any payments that are conditioned, in whole or in part, on a change of control of Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary, (v) any collective bargaining agreement, (vi) any joint

described in clauses (i) through (ix), together with (x) all Wisconsin IP
Contracts, (y) any Contract (or group of related Contracts with the same
party) pursuant to which Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary generated

and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries in excess of $17,000,000 in the 12 months
ending December 31, 2009, (of which Contracts Wisconsin has provided true,
correct and complete copies to Georgia prior to the date hereof) being
referred to herein as " _Wisconsin Material Contracts_ "). 

   

 (b) Each Wisconsin Material Contract is valid and binding on Wisconsin (or, to the extent a Subsidiary of Wisconsin is a party, such Subsidiary) and, to the Knowledge of Wisconsin, any other party thereto, and is in full force and effect and enforceable against Wisconsin or a Wisconsin Subsidiary, as applicable (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies). Neither Wisconsin nor any Wisconsin Subsidiary is in material breach or default under any Wisconsin Material Contract. Neither Wisconsin nor any Subsidiary of Wisconsin has received notice of any material violation or default under any Wisconsin Material Contract by any other party thereto. Prior to the date hereof, Wisconsin has made available to Georgia true and complete copies of all Wisconsin Material Contracts. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Indebtedness_ " of a Person means (i) all obligations of such Person for borrowed money, (ii) all obligations of such Person evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes and similar agreements, (iii) all leases of such Person capitalized pursuant to GAAP, and (iv) all obligations of such Person under sale-and-lease back transactions, agreements to repurchase securities sold and other similar financing transactions.

   ##### 

  

  

 3.15 _Environmental Liability_. Except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Wisconsin, (i) there are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that are reasonably likely to result in the imposition, on Wisconsin of any liability or obligation under Environmental Laws, or pending or, to the Knowledge of Wisconsin, threatened against Wisconsin; (ii) Wisconsin is not subject to any Order or party to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any third party imposing any liability or obligation under any Environmental Laws; (iii) Wisconsin has complied and is in compliance with all Environmental Laws, including obtaining and complying with all Permits that may be required pursuant to Environmental Laws; and (iv) Wisconsin has not treated, stored, disposed of, arranged for or permitted the disposal of, transported, handled, or released, or exposed any person to any hazardous substance or waste, or owned or operated any property or facility contaminated by any hazardous substance or waste so as to give rise to any current or future liabilities under Environmental Laws. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Environmental Laws_ " means any common law or local, state, federal or foreign statute, regulation, ordinance or similar provision having the force or effect of law, any judicial and administrative order or determination, or any contractual obligation concerning public health and safety, worker health and safety, or pollution or protection of the environment, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended. 

  

 3.16 _Real Property_. 

  

 (a) Each of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries has good title free and clear of all Liens to all real property owned by such entities (the " _Wisconsin Owned Properties_ "), except for Liens that do not materially detract from the present use of such real property. 

  

 (b) A true and complete copy of each agreement pursuant to which Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary leases any material real property (such agreements, together with any amendments, modifications and other supplements thereto, collectively, the " _Wisconsin Leases_ ") has heretofore been made available to Georgia. Each Wisconsin Lease is valid, binding and enforceable against Wisconsin or an applicable Wisconsin Subsidiary in accordance with its terms and is in full force and effect (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies), except where the failure to be valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Wisconsin. There are no defaults by Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary, as applicable, under any of the Wisconsin Leases which, in the aggregate, would result in the termination of such Leases and a Material Adverse Effect on Wisconsin. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not cause defaults under the Wisconsin Leases, except for any such default which would not individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries taken as a whole. 

  

 (c) The Wisconsin Owned Properties and the properties leased pursuant to the Wisconsin Leases (the " _Wisconsin Leased Properties_ ") constitute all of the real estate on which Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries maintain their facilities or conduct their business as of 

   ##### 

   

 

the date of this Agreement, except for locations the loss of which would not
result in a Material Adverse Effect on Wisconsin and the Wisconsin
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. 

   

 (d) A true and complete copy of each agreement pursuant to which Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary leases any material real property to a third party (such agreements, together with any amendments, modifications and other supplements thereto, collectively, the " _Third Party Wisconsin Leases_ ") has heretofore been made available to Georgia. Each Third Party Wisconsin Lease is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms and is in full force and effect (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies), except where the failure to be valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Wisconsin. There are no existing defaults by the tenant under any Third Party Wisconsin Lease which, in the aggregate, would result in the termination of such Third Party Wisconsin Leases except for any such default which would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries taken as a whole. 

  

 3.17 _State Takeover Laws_. Wisconsin has, or will have prior to the Effective Time, taken all necessary action so that, assuming compliance by Georgia and Merger Sub with their respective obligations hereunder and the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by Georgia and Merger Sub herein, no "business combination," "moratorium," "fair price," "control share acquisition" or other state anti-takeover statute or regulation, nor any takeover-related provision in the Wisconsin Articles or the Wisconsin By-laws, would (i) prohibit or restrict Wisconsins ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement, any related agreement, the Support Agreement, or the Articles of Merger or its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (ii) have the effect of invalidating or voiding this Agreement, the Support Agreement or the Articles of Merger, or any provision hereof or thereof, or (iii) subject Georgia to any impediment or condition in connection with the exercise of any of its rights under this Agreement or the Articles of Merger. 

  

 3.18  _Reorganization_. As of the date of this Agreement, Wisconsin is not aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 3.19 _Opinion_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of Wisconsin has received an opinion from Barclays Capital Inc. to the effect that as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio is fair to the shareholders of Wisconsin from a financial point of view. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement. 

  

 3.20 _Internal Controls_. (a) None of Wisconsin or its Subsidiaries records, systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored, maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of it or its Subsidiaries or accountants except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a materially adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the 

   ##### 

  

 

next sentence. Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries have designed and
maintained a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP. 

   

 (b) Wisconsin (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Wisconsin (including the Wisconsin Subsidiaries), is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Wisconsin by others within those entities, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Wisconsins outside auditors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Wisconsin (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Wisconsins ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Wisconsins internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to Wisconsins auditors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Wisconsin and a copy has previously been made available to Georgia. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of Wisconsin, there is no reason to believe that Wisconsins outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due. 

  

 (c) Since December 31, 2005 through the date hereof, (i) neither Wisconsin nor any Wisconsin Subsidiary has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary, whether or not employed by Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Wisconsin or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Wisconsin or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of Wisconsin. 

  

 3.21 _Insurance_. Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries are insured with reputable insurers against such risks and in such amounts as its management reasonably has determined to be prudent in accordance with industry practices. To the Knowledge of Wisconsin, neither Wisconsin nor any Wisconsin Subsidiary is in material breach or material default of any insurance policies maintained by Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary or has taken any action or failed to take any action that, with notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default or permit termination (prior to the scheduled termination or expiration thereof) or modification of any such insurance policies. To the Knowledge of Wisconsin, neither Wisconsin nor any Wisconsin Subsidiary has received any notice of 

   ##### 

  

 

termination or cancellation (prior to the scheduled termination or expiration
thereof) or denial of coverage with respect to any such insurance policy. 

   

 3.22 _Wisconsin Information_. The information relating to Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary to be included or incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 will not, at the time the Form S-4 is declared effective, the time the Joint Proxy Statement is first mailed to shareholders of Wisconsin and Georgia and the time of the Wisconsin Shareholders Meeting and the Georgia Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The information relating to Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary that is provided or to be provided by Wisconsin or its representatives for inclusion in any document (other than the Form S-4) filed with any other Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading.

There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Wisconsin, there have not been threatened within the past two years any, claims by any Person alleging infringement, misappropriation or other violation by Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary of any other Persons Intellectual Property that, individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Wisconsin.

 (d) Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries (i) take reasonable actions to protect, maintain and preserve the (A) operation and security of the Wisconsin IT Assets, (B) confidentiality of data, information, and Trade Secrets owned, held or used by Wisconsin or the

 Except (i) as disclosed in, and reasonably apparent from, any report, schedule, form or other document filed with, or furnished to, the SEC by Georgia and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding, in each case, any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section and in any section relating to forward-looking statements to the extent that they are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), or (ii) as disclosed in a correspondingly numbered section of the disclosure schedule (the " _Georgia Disclosure Schedule_ ") delivered by Georgia and Merger Sub to Wisconsin prior to the execution of this Agreement (which schedule sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in this _Article IV_, or to one or more of Georgias covenants contained herein; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the mere inclusion of an item in such schedule shall not be deemed an admission that such item is required to be disclosed therein or represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Georgia or Merger Sub; _provided_ , _further_ , that the disclosure of any item in any section of the Georgia Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any other section of the Georgia Disclosure Schedule to which such item is relevant, whether or not a specific cross reference appears, so long as the relevance is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure), Georgia and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, hereby represent and warrant to Wisconsin as follows:

To the Knowledge of Georgia, there does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of Georgia or any Georgia Subsidiary following the Effective Time, other than such liabilities that arise solely out of, or relate solely to, the Georgia Benefit Plans. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Georgia nor any Georgia Subsidiary, nor, to Georgias Knowledge, any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.

There are no defaults by Georgia or any Georgia Subsidiary, as applicable, under any of the Georgia Leases which, in the aggregate, would result in the termination of such Georgia Leases and a Material Adverse Effect on Georgia. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not cause defaults under the Georgia Leases, except for any such default which would not individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Georgia and the Georgia Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

a whole. 

  

 4.17 _State Takeover Laws_.

(a) None of Georgia or its Subsidiaries records, systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored, maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of it or its Subsidiaries or accountants except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a materially adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the next sentence. Georgia and the Georgia Subsidiaries have designed and maintained a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

These disclosures were made in writing by management to Georgias auditors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Georgia and a copy has previously been made available to Georgia. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of Georgia, there is no reason to believe that 

   ##### 

  

    

its outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due. 

  

 (c) Since December 31, 2005 through the date hereof, (i) neither Georgia nor any Georgia Subsidiary has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Georgia or any Georgia Subsidiary or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Georgia or any Georgia Subsidiary has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Georgia or any Georgia Subsidiary, whether or not employed by Georgia or any Georgia Subsidiary, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Georgia or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Georgia or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of Georgia.

There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Georgia, there have not been threatened within the past two years any, claims by any Person alleging infringement, misappropriation or other violation by Georgia or any Georgia Subsidiary of any other Persons Intellectual Property that, individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Georgia. To the Knowledge of Georgia, the conduct of the business of Georgia and the Georgia Subsidiaries and use of the Georgia IP does not misappropriate, infringe or otherwise violate in any material respect any Intellectual Property of any other 

   ##### 

  

    

Person. Neither Georgia nor any Georgia Subsidiary has filed any claim for
misappropriation, infringement or other violation by another Person of its

Neither Georgia nor any Georgia Subsidiary nor, to the Knowledge of Georgia, any other party, is in material breach or default under any such Georgia IP Contract. No party to any Georgia IP Contract has given Georgia or any Georgia Subsidiary written notice of its intention to cancel, terminate, change the scope of rights under, or fail to renew any Georgia IP Contract. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not place Georgia or any Georgia Subsidiary in material breach or default of any Georgia IP Contract, or trigger any material modification, termination or acceleration or cause any additional fees to be due thereunder. 

  

 (d) Georgia and the Georgia Subsidiaries (i) take reasonable actions to protect, maintain and preserve the (A) operation and security of the Georgia IT Assets, (B) confidentiality of data, information, and Trade Secrets owned, held or used by Georgia or the Georgia Subsidiaries, and (C) Intellectual Property material to their respective businesses (including by having and enforcing a policy that prior and current employees, consultants and agents with access to Trade Secrets, execute non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements for the benefit of Georgia and/or the Georgia Subsidiaries), (ii) abide by all Laws regarding the collection, use, transfer and disclosure of personally identifiable and other confidential information, including customer and client information, and (iii) are not subject to any pending or, to the Knowledge of Georgia, threatened claim that alleges a material breach of any of the foregoing or inquiry by any Governmental Entity regarding the foregoing. 

  

 (e) The Georgia IT Assets have not been interrupted or failed within the past three (3) years in a manner that materially impaired Georgia or the Georgia Subsidiaries ability to deliver Georgias core products and services to their respective customers. The Georgia IP is not subject to any material pending or outstanding Action or Order, and to the Knowledge of Georgia, there are no Actions or Orders threatened, that question or seek to cancel, limit, challenge or modify the ownership, validity, enforceability, registerability, patentability, use or right to use Georgia IP, or that would restrict, impair or otherwise materially adversely affect Georgias or the Georgia Subsidiaries use thereof or their rights thereto.

To the Knowledge of Georgia, neither Georgia nor 

   ##### 

  

    

any Georgia Subsidiary has received any notice of termination or cancellation
(prior to the scheduled termination or expiration thereof) or denial of
coverage with respect to any such insurance policy. 

  

 4.22 _Georgia Information_. The information relating to Georgia or any Georgia Subsidiary to be included or incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 will not, at the time the Form S-4 is declared effective, the time the Joint Proxy Statement is first mailed to shareholders of Wisconsin and Georgia and the time of the Wisconsin Shareholders Meeting and the Georgia Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading.

The parties shall cooperate and provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 prior to filing such with the SEC and will provide each other with a copy of all such filings with the SEC to the extent not otherwise publicly available. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, Georgia or Wisconsin has Knowledge of any information relating to Georgia or Wisconsin, or any of their respective officers, directors or other Affiliates, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement so that any such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and, to the extent required by applicable Laws, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required under applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of Georgia and Wisconsin. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 shall be made without the approval of both Georgia and Wisconsin, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned;  _provided_ that Wisconsin, in connection with a Change in Wisconsin Recommendation, and Georgia, in connection with a Change in Georgia Recommendation, may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement and/or the Form S-4 (including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment to effect such a change, and in such event, this right of approval shall apply only

with respect to information relating to the other party or its business,
financial condition or results of operations, and shall be subject to the
right of each party to have its Board of Directors deliberations and
conclusions to be accurately described. A " _Qualifying Amendment_ " means an
amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form
S-4 (including by incorporation by reference) to the extent that it contains
(i) a Change in Wisconsin Recommendation or a Change in Georgia
Recommendation (as the case may be), (ii) a statement of the reasons of the
Board of Directors of Wisconsin or Georgia (as the case may be) for making

Each of Wisconsin and Georgia shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to Wisconsin or Georgia, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all Permits, consents, approvals, clearances and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received by Wisconsin or Georgia, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Georgia or Wisconsin to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing Permits, consents, approvals, clearances and authorizations of third parties or Governmental Entities, that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect (measured on a scale relative to Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) on Georgia, Wisconsin or the Surviving Company (a " _Materially Burdensome Condition_ "). In addition, Wisconsin and Georgia agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to prepare and file such petitions and filings, and to obtain such permits, consents, approvals, clearances and authorizations of third parties and

Governmental Entities, that may be necessary or advisable to effect any
mergers and/or consolidations of the Wisconsin Subsidiaries and the Georgia
Subsidiaries following consummation of the Merger. 

   

 (c) Subject to the provisos contained in _Section 6.1(b)_, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, each of Wisconsin and Georgia shall cooperate in all respects with the other and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 6.1_ shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or _8.1(c)_ so long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this _Section 6.1._  

  

 (d) Each of Georgia and Wisconsin shall, upon request, furnish to the other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Georgia, Wisconsin or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (e) Each of Georgia, Merger Sub and Wisconsin shall promptly advise the other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed, and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provide the other party with a copy of such communication. 

  

 (f) Each of Georgia and Wisconsin shall give the other party the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against such party and its directors relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such settlement shall be agreed to without the other partys prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. 

  

 6.2 _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of Wisconsin and Georgia shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the other, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and, during such period, the parties shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other may reasonably request. Each of Wisconsin and Georgia shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, provide to the other party a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the 

   ##### 

  

 

requirements of federal securities Laws. Neither Wisconsin nor Georgia nor any
of their Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such party determines in good faith, after consultation
with legal counsel, that such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene
any Law, Order or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

Wisconsin and Georgia shall each call a meeting of their respective shareholders to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the requisite shareholder approval required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger (the " _Wisconsin Shareholder Meeting_ " and the " _Georgia Shareholder Meeting_ ," respectively), and each shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable. Wisconsin and Georgia shall each use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Wisconsin Shareholder Meeting and the Georgia Shareholder Meeting to be held on the same day. The Board of Directors of Wisconsin has resolved to recommend to Wisconsins shareholders that such shareholders vote in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Wisconsin Recommendation_ "). Unless the Board of Directors of Wisconsin has effected a Change in Wisconsin Recommendation or terminated this Agreement, in each case in accordance with _Section 6.11(c)_, or as otherwise directed in writing by Georgia, this Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted to the shareholders of Wisconsin at the Wisconsin Shareholder Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Wisconsin Shareholder Approval, and Wisconsin and its Board of Directors shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Wisconsin Shareholder Approval.

 6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject to _Section 6.1(b)_, each of Georgia and Wisconsin shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger, to cause the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a reasonably expeditious manner (including, in 

   ##### 

  

 

the case of Georgia, using reasonable best efforts to take such steps as may
be necessary to refinance the outstanding Indebtedness of Wisconsin as of the
Effective Time, and in the case of Wisconsin, using reasonable best efforts
to cooperate with and take such steps as may be reasonably requested by
Georgia in connection therewith), and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with
the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or
approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third
party that is required to be obtained by Wisconsin or Georgia or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
the parties hereto shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts in
order for Wisconsin to obtain the opinions of Kirkland and Ellis LLP described
in _Sections 7.1(g)(i)_ and _7.3(c)_ and for Georgia to obtain the opinions
of Deloitte Tax LLP described in _Sections 7.1(g)(ii)_ and  _7.2(c)_. In

Sub) shall deliver to Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Deloitte Tax LLP, as
applicable, representation letters, dated and executed as of the dates of

Deloitte Tax LLP, as applicable. 

   

 6.5 _NYSE Listing_. Georgia shall cause the shares of Georgia Common Stock to be issued in the Merger (including Assumed Restricted Shares) and such other shares of Georgia Common Stock to be reserved for issuance in connection with the Merger (including shares of Georgia Common Stock to be issued upon the exercise of Assumed Stock Options or the settlement of Assumed Stock Units and shares of Georgia Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the SPR Agreement) to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 6.6 _Employee Matters_. (a) From the Effective Time through December 31, 2009, the employees of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries who are employed by Georgia, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates as of the Effective Time and who remain employed with Georgia, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates thereafter (the " _Assumed Employees_ ") will be offered compensation and employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and employee benefits provided to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding equity-based compensation (including benefits under an employee stock purchase plan) and subject to Section 6.6(e), benefits under a tax qualified retirement plan and 401(k) plan); _provided_ that: (i) continued participation and coverage following the Effective Time under the Wisconsin Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to satisfy the obligations under this sentence, it being understood that the Assumed Employees may commence participating in the comparable Georgia benefit plans on different dates following the Effective Time with respect to different comparable Georgia benefit plans; (ii) the foregoing shall not apply to Assumed Employees who have entered into or will enter into an individual employment agreement with Georgia or any Georgia Subsidiary; (iii) from the Effective Time through the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Georgia shall, and shall cause the Georgia Subsidiaries (including Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries following the Effective Time) to, provide each employee of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (whether or not such employee is an Assumed Employee) with severance and other separation benefits that are no less favorable than those provided by Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries to employees of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (it being understood that the provision of severance and other separation benefits under and 

   ##### 

  

 

in accordance with the terms of an Wisconsin Benefit Plan applicable to
Assumed Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time or as approved by
the President and Chief Executive Officer of Georgia (as of the Effective
Time) shall be deemed to satisfy the obligations under this Section
6.6(a)(iii)); (iv) there shall be no requirement that such Assumed Employees
receive grants of equity based compensation; (v) Assumed Employees
shall become first eligible to participate in the employee stock purchase
plan of Georgia as of the first business day in January 2010 in accordance
with its terms; and (vi) the Assumed Employees shall be eligible to
participate in a Georgia DC Plan on the same basis as similarly-situated
employees of Georgia ( _provided_ that if an Assumed Employee was eligible to
participate in a Wisconsin DC Plan as of immediately prior to the Closing
Date, such Assumed Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate in
accordance with its terms in the applicable Georgia DC Plan as of
the Effective Time). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to guarantee
employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of the
Surviving Company to terminate, any Assumed Employee for any reason. 

   

 (b) Georgia shall cause each Georgia benefit plan in which Assumed Employees are eligible to participate to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals under the Georgia benefit plans (including employee stock purchase, vacation, sick pay, severance and retirement plans, but excluding benefit accruals under any of Georgias tax-qualified and non-qualified pension plans) the service of such employees with Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service or with respect to newly implemented plans for which prior service is not taken into account or with respect to plans for which participation, service and/or benefit accrual is frozen. Nothing herein shall limit the ability of Georgia, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company to amend or terminate any of the Wisconsin Benefit Plans or Georgia Benefits Plans in accordance with their terms at any time. 

  

 (c) At and following the Effective Time, Georgia will cause the Surviving Company to honor the accrued and vested obligations of Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary as of the Effective Time under the provisions of the Wisconsin Benefit Plans and Wisconsin Employment Agreements,  _provided_ that this provision shall not prevent the Surviving Company from amending, suspending or terminating any such plans or agreements to the extent permitted by the respective terms of such plans or agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall constitute or be deemed to be an amendment to any Wisconsin Benefit Plan, Wisconsin Employment Agreement, Georgia Benefit Plan, Georgia Employment Agreement or any other compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement of Georgia, Wisconsin or any of their respective Subsidiaries. 

  

 (d) If Assumed Employees become eligible to participate in a life, disability, medical, dental or other health care insurance plan of Georgia or its Subsidiaries, Georgia shall cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions are covered under the applicable life, disability, medical, health or dental plans of Georgia, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability 

   ##### 

  

 

requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee on or after
the Effective Time for the year in which the Effective Time or participation
in such life, disability, medical, dental or other health care insurance plan
of Georgia, as applicable, occurs, in each case to the extent such employee
had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous life,
disability, medical, dental or other health care insurance plan of Wisconsin
prior to the Effective Time for the year in which the Effective Time or
participation in such life, disability, medical, dental or health care
insurance plan of Georgia, as applicable, occurs. 

   

 (e) Effective as of immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _DC Termination Date_ "), and subject to the Effective Time actually occurring, Wisconsin shall, or shall cause a Wisconsin Subsidiary, to (i) terminate all Wisconsin Qualified Plans that are defined contribution plans, as defined under Section 3(34) of ERISA (each a " _Wisconsin DC Plan_ "); (ii) contribute to each such Wisconsin DC Plan on or as soon as practicable following the DC Termination Date all contributions required to be made for periods prior to the DC Termination Date on behalf of participants in each such Wisconsin DC Plan; (iii) cause the account balances of all participants in each Wisconsin DC Plan to be fully vested as of the DC Termination Date; and (iv) take any actions necessary to ensure that the account balances of participants in each Wisconsin DC Plan are distributable from the Wisconsin DC Plan on or as promptly as administratively practicable after the DC Termination Date or, if an application for a favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding the qualified status of the Wisconsin DC Plan upon termination has been made, after the receipt of such favorable determination letter. Georgia shall cause each Assumed Employee who was a participant in a Wisconsin DC Plan and who has an account balance under such Wisconsin DC Plan to be permitted to elect a "direct rollover" of such Assumed Employees account balance (including promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans) from the applicable Wisconsin DC Plan to a Georgia Qualified Plan that is a defined contribution plan within the meaning of Section 3(34) of ERISA (a " _Georgia DC Plan_ ") subject to and provided that, Georgia or the proper fiduciaries of the applicable Georgia DC Plan become reasonably satisfied, consistent with the regulations under Section 401(a)(31) of the Code and ERISA, that the applicable Wisconsin DC Plan meets the requirements for qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code and the requirements of the Georgia DC Plan. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the Closing, Georgia shall, or shall cause the Georgia Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company and the Wisconsin Subsidiaries) to, assume the Employee Matters Agreement, dated as of April 3, 2007, between Wisconsin, Metavante Corporation, New MandI Corporation and Marshal and Ilsley Corporation, as amended by Amendment No 1 to the Employee Matters Agreement, dated as of August 21, 2007, between Wisconsin, Metavante Corporation, New MandI Corporation and Marshall and Ilsley Corporation. 

  

 (g) Each Assumed Employee shall be eligible to receive an annual bonus in respect of 2009 equal to the sum of (x) with respect to the period commencing January 1, 2009 and ending on the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Period_ "), the amount earned by such Assumed Employee and accrued and reserved on Wisconsins financial statements for such Assumed Employee during such period as of immediately prior to the Closing Date based on the actual performance of Wisconsin and such Assumed Employee through the Closing Date in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable short-term incentive plan of Wisconsin in which the Assumed Employee is a participant and (y) with respect to the period commencing on the day 

   ##### 

  

 

following the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2009 (" _Post-Closing
Period_ "), an amount determined in accordance with a short-term incentive
plan of Georgia during such period, based on the combined performance of
Georgia and Wisconsin and such Assumed Employees performance (the sum of (x)
and (y) with respect to each Assumed Employee, such Assumed Employees "
_2009 Annual Bonus_ "). Payment of 2009 Annual Bonuses to each Assumed
Employee shall be subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors of Georgia and the terms and conditions of the
applicable short-term incentive plan of Wisconsin with respect to the Pre-
Closing Period and the terms and conditions of the applicable short-term
incentive plan of Georgia with respect to the Post-Closing Period and payable
in accordance therewith at such time as 2009 annual bonuses are paid to
similarly situated employees of Georgia. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
no event shall an Assumed Employed receive a 2009 Annual Bonus described in
this Section 6.6(g) unless the Assumed Employed remains employed through the
later of the date specified in the applicable short-term incentive plan or
December 31, 2009 and meets such other requirements as specified in the
applicable short-term incentive plan. 

   

 (h) Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.11_, this _Section 6.6_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party to this Agreement, and nothing in this  _Section 6.6_, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person, including, any current or former director, officer or employee of Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary, any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.6_. 

  

 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary or who is or was serving at the request of Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary as a director or officer of another person (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director or officer of Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. From and after the Effective Time, Georgia shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the Wisconsin Articles, the Wisconsin By-laws and any agreement set forth in _Section 6.7(a)_ of the Wisconsin Disclosure Schedule, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reimbursement for reasonable fees and expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

  

 (b) Georgia shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of Wisconsin or any Wisconsin Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six years from the Effective Time by the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by Wisconsin ( _provided_ that Georgia may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less 

   ##### 

  

 

advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and
directors in their capacity as such. Wisconsin shall, upon request of
Georgia and in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, purchase, prior to
the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions
(in both amount and scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits as the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained
by Wisconsin with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors in their
capacity as such. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Georgia be
required to, and Wisconsin shall not, expend more than 250% per year of
coverage of the amount currently expended by Wisconsin per year of coverage as
of the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") to maintain or
procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto. If Georgia is unable to maintain
or obtain the insurance called for by this  _Section 6.7_, Georgia shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as available for the Maximum Amount. The
Indemnified Parties may be required to make reasonable application and
provide reasonable and customary representations and warranties to Georgias
insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance, comparable in
nature and scope to the applications, representations and warranties required
of persons who are officers and directors of Georgia as of the date hereof. 

   

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. 

  

 (d) If Georgia or the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Georgia or the Surviving Company (or acquiror of such assets), as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.7. 

  

 6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Georgia Subsidiary, on the one hand, and a Wisconsin Subsidiary, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Company with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, Georgia. 

  

 6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Georgia, Merger Sub and Wisconsin shall promptly advise the other of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement;  _provided_ , _further_ , that a failure to comply with this _Section 6.9_ shall not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in 

   ##### 

  

 

 _Article VII_ to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect
or material breach would independently result in the failure of a condition
set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied. 

   

 6.10 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Georgia and Wisconsin agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain Wisconsin Insiders in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Wisconsin Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in connection with the settlement or conversion of shares of Wisconsin Common Stock, Wisconsin Performance Shares, Wisconsin Stock Options and Wisconsin Stock Units into shares of Georgia Common Stock, Assumed Stock Options, Assumed Performance Shares, cash and Assumed Stock Units, as applicable, pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this _Section 6.10_. Assuming that Wisconsin delivers to Georgia the Section 16 Information in a timely fashion, the Board of Directors of Georgia, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by Wisconsin Insiders of Georgia Common Stock in exchange for shares of Wisconsin Common Stock, of Assumed Stock Options upon conversion of Wisconsin Stock Options, of Assumed Performance Shares, and of Assumed Stock Units upon conversion of Wisconsin Stock Units, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. " _Section 16 Information_" shall mean information accurate in all material respects regarding Wisconsin Insiders, the number of shares of Wisconsin Common Stock and Assumed Performance Shares held by each such Wisconsin Insider and expected to be exchanged for Georgia Common Stock in the Merger, and the number and description of Wisconsin Stock Options or Wisconsin Stock Units held by each such Wisconsin Insider and expected to be converted into Assumed Stock Options or Assumed Stock Units, as applicable, in connection with the Merger;  _provided_ that the requirement for a description of any Wisconsin Stock Options and Wisconsin Stock Units shall be deemed to be satisfied if copies of all Wisconsin Stock Plans, and forms of agreements evidencing grants thereunder, under which such Wisconsin Stock Options and Wisconsin Stock Units have been granted, have been made available to Georgia. " _Wisconsin Insiders_ " shall mean those officers and directors (including directors by deputization) of Wisconsin who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in the Section 16 Information. 

  

 6.11 _No Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) None of Wisconsin or Georgia (each, a " _No-Shop Party_ ", and with respect to each other, the " _Other Party_ ") or its respective Subsidiaries or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of such No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate, directly or indirectly (including by way of furnishing information), or take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving such No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) 

   ##### 

  

 

participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative
Transaction or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Alternative
Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of a No-
Shop Party shall be permitted, prior to the meeting of shareholders of such
No-Shop Party to be held pursuant to _Section 6.3_, and subject to
compliance with the other terms of this _Section 6.11_ and to first entering
into a confidentiality agreement with the Person proposing such
Acquisition Proposal on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable
to such No-Shop Party than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement,
to furnish information concerning such No-Shop Party and its Subsidiaries to
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and to consider and
participate in discussions and negotiations with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal received by such No-Shop Party, if and only to the extent that (A)
such Acquisition Proposal is an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal, and (B) the Board of Directors of such No-Shop Party
reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that (x) such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to
lead to, a Superior Proposal and (y) failure to do so would cause it to
violate its fiduciary duties. 

   

 As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means, in respect of either No-Shop Party, any of (i) a transaction pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) other than the Other Party or its affiliates, directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 25 percent of the outstanding shares of Wisconsin Common Stock or Georgia Common Stock, as applicable, or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect to the Merger, whether from such No-Shop Party, or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) any transaction pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) other than the Other Party or its affiliates acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of any Subsidiaries of such No-Shop Party and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination, including any of its Subsidiaries) of such No-Shop Party or any of its subsidiaries representing more than 25 percent of the fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of such No-Shop Party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or (iii) any other merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving such No-Shop Party or any of its subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as a result of which the holders of shares of Wisconsin Common Stock or Georgia Common Stock, as applicable, immediately prior to such transaction do not, in the aggregate, own at least 75 percent of each of the outstanding shares of common stock and the outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity in such transaction immediately after the consummation thereof in substantially the same proportion as such holders held the shares of Wisconsin Common Stock or Georgia Common Stock, as applicable, immediately prior to the consummation thereof. 

  

 As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means, with respect to a No-Shop Party, a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (with the references to 25 percent included in the definition of Alternative Transaction changed to 66 percent and the reference to 75 percent in clause (iii) of such definition changed to 33 percent) for such No-Shop Party obtained not in violation of this _Section 6.11_ which the Board of Directors of such No-Shop Party determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking into account such facts as the Board of Directors considers to be appropriate (including conditions to and expected timing and risks of consummation, the ability of the Person making such proposal 

   ##### 

  

 

to obtain financing for such Acquisition Proposal, and any break-up fees or
expense reimbursement provisions), (i) is reasonably likely to be consummated
in accordance with its terms, and (ii) if consummated, would result in a
transaction more favorable to the holders of common stock of such No-Shop
Party than the Merger. 

   

 (b) Other than in accordance with _Section 6.11(c)_ below, the Board of Directors of a No-Shop Party shall not (i) withdraw (or not continue to make) or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to the Other Party, or publicly propose to withdraw (or not continue to make) or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Other Party, the Wisconsin Recommendation or the Georgia Recommendation, as the case may be, (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal within two business days upon the request of the Other Party, or (iv) take any other action or make any other public statement that is inconsistent with the Wisconsin Recommendation or Georgia Recommendation, as the case may be (any action described in clauses (i) through (iv), taken by the Board of Directors of either Wisconsin or Georgia, a " _Change in Wisconsin Recommendation_ " or a " _Change in Georgia Recommendation_ ", respectively). 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.11_, at any time prior to obtaining the Wisconsin Shareholder Approval or Georgia Shareholder Approval, as applicable, if a No-Shop Party has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not obtained in violation of this _Section 6.11_, that has not been withdrawn or abandoned and that the Board of Directors of such No-Shop Party has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by the Other Party pursuant to clause (ii) below (if applicable), the Board of Directors of such No-Shop Party may (x) effect a Change in Wisconsin Recommendation or a Change in Georgia Recommendation, as applicable, and/or (y) terminate the Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement regarding a Superior Proposal if the following conditions are met: 

  

       | (i)  |   | in the case of any action described in either
clause (x) or clause (y) above, the Board of Directors of the No-Shop Party
has determined in good faith that the failure to take such action would
violate the fiduciary duties of the members of the Board of Directors to
the holders of shares of common stock of such No-Shop Party under
applicable Laws;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | in the case of any action described in either
clause (x) or clause (y) above, (a) the No-Shop Party has provided prior
written notice to the Other Party, at least five calendar days in advance
(the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to effect a Change in
Wisconsin Recommendation or a Change in Georgia Recommendation, as
applicable, and/or to terminate the Agreement, which notice shall specify the
material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and contemporaneously
with providing such notice shall have provided a copy of the relevant
proposed transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal
and other material documents, and (b) prior to effecting such Change in
Wisconsin Recommendation or a  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       |   |   | Change in Georgia Recommendation, as applicable,
and/or terminating the Agreement, the No-Shop Party shall, and shall cause
its legal and financial advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with
the Other Party in good faith (to the extent the Other Party desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal. In the event that during the Notice Period any revisions are made
to the Superior Proposal and the Board of Directors of such No-Shop Party in
its good faith judgment determines such revisions are material (it being
agreed that any change in the purchase price in such Superior Proposal shall
be deemed a material revision), the No-Shop Party shall be required to
deliver a new written notice to the Other Party and to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 6.11(c)_ with respect to such new written
notice; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (iii)  |   | in the case of any action described in clause
(y) above, (A) the No-Shop Party has complied in all material respects with
its obligations under this _Section 6.11_ and (B) the No-Shop Party
shall have paid the Termination Fee to the Other Party in accordance with 
_Section 8.3(c)_.  
   

  

 (d) Each No-Shop Party shall notify the other No-Shop Party promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any material modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to such No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of such No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person or entity that informs the Board of Directors of such No-Shop Party or any Subsidiary of such No-Shop Party that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to the other No-Shop Party shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal or intending to make or considering making an Acquisition Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of such No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries, and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal. Each No-Shop Party shall keep the other No-Shop Party fully informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes or modifications in the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, and at all times shall negotiate in good faith with the other No-Shop Party regarding possible modifications to the terms of this Agreement which may arise in connection with any Acquisition Proposal. Each No-Shop Party shall also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify the other No-Shop Party, orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal in accordance with this _Section 6.11_. 

  

 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.11_ shall prohibit a No-Shop Party or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 (f) Each No-Shop Party and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than the other No-Shop Party) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and shall use 

   ##### 

  

 

reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other than the other No-Shop
Party who have been furnished confidential information regarding such first
No-Shop Party in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding
an Acquisition Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date
hereof promptly to return or destroy such information. Each No-Shop Party
agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party
from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which
such No-Shop Party or its Subsidiaries is or may become a party, and
shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may
have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any Person
to make an Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (g) Each No-Shop Party shall ensure that the officers, directors and all employees, agents and representatives (including any investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other retained representatives) of such No-Shop Party or its Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions described in this _Section 6.11_ as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof. It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.11_ by any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of a No-Shop Party or its Subsidiaries, at the direction or with the consent of such No-Shop Party or its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.11_ by such No-Shop Party. 

  

 6.12 _Takeover Statutes_. Each of Georgia, Merger Sub and Wisconsin shall use its reasonable best efforts (i) to take all actions necessary so that no "moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "anti-greenmail," "takeover," "interested shareholder" or similar Laws is or becomes applicable to the Merger, the Support Agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any such Laws is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to take all actions necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Laws on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Subject to compliance with applicable Law and _Section 1.1(b)_, this Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors or managing member or sole member, as applicable, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Wisconsin or Georgia;  _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the shareholders of Wisconsin or Georgia, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires such further approval under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. 

   

 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors or managing member or sole member, as applicable, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the shareholders of Wisconsin and Georgia, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders any extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion hereof that changes the amount or form of the consideration to be delivered to the holders of Wisconsin Common Stock under this Agreement, other than as contemplated by this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 9.5 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The Wisconsin Disclosure Schedule and the Georgia Disclosure Schedule, as well as all other schedules and all exhibits hereto, shall be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be interpreted or construed to require any Person to take any action, or fail to take any action, if to do so would violate any applicable Law. 

   

 9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become 

    ##### 

  

    

effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other party, it being understood that each party need not
sign the same counterpart. 

   

 9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to in this Agreement), together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 9.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and wholly performed within such state, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles, except to the extent the Laws of the State of Wisconsin apply. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal or state court located in the state of Delaware, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in _Section 9.4_ shall be deemed effective service of process on such party. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 

   

 9.9 _Publicity_. Neither Wisconsin nor Georgia shall, and neither Wisconsin nor Georgia shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of Georgia, in the case of a proposed announcement or statement by Wisconsin, or Wisconsin, in the case of a proposed announcement or statement by Georgia; _provided_ , _however_ , that either party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after prior consultation with the other party to the extent practicable under the circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement to the extent required by Law or by the rules and regulations of the NYSE. 

   

 9.10 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned by either of the parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in _Section 6.7_, this Agreement (including the documents and 

    ##### 

  

    

instruments referred to in this Agreement) is not intended to and does not
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
under this Agreement. 

   

 9.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any federal or state court located in the state of Delaware in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are hereby waived. 

   

 9.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by virtue of any applicable Law, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.
