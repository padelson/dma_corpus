surviving the merger) if it determines in good faith that such change is necessary or desirable to
address legal, commercial, regulatory or Tax concerns, and the parties shall cooperate with each
other in good faith to implement such alternative method, including by entering into an appropriate
amendment to this Agreement (to the extent such amendment only changes the method of effecting the

no such change shall (i)&nbsp;alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided
for in this Agreement, (ii)&nbsp;adversely affect the Tax treatment of Wisconsin&#146;s shareholders as a
result of receiving the Merger Consideration or the Tax treatment of either party pursuant to this
Agreement, (iii)&nbsp;increase the conditionality or prevent the satisfaction of any condition to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv)&nbsp;materially impede or delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Georgia Qualified Plan (A)(i) has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS with
