iii         AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN
OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into on November 27, 2006,
by and among ANGIODYNAMICS, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), ROYAL I,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and RITA MEDICAL SYSTEMS, INC., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this
Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.   RECITALS   WHEREAS, Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger (the "Merger") of the Company
with and into Merger Sub in accordance with this Agreement and the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") and the applicable
provisions of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the "DLLCA");  
WHEREAS, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code") and this Agreement shall constitute the plan of
reorganization;   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (i)
has determined that the Merger is in the best interests of, and is advisable
to, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) has approved and adopted this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) has taken all corporate action necessary to render the
rights issuable under the Company Rights Agreement inapplicable to this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (iv)
has determined to recommend that the stockholders of the Company adopt this
Agreement (the recommendation referred to in this clause (iv) is referred to
in this Agreement as the "Company Recommendation");   WHEREAS, the Board of
Directors of Parent (i) has determined that the Merger is in the best
interests of Parent and its stockholders, (ii) has approved and adopted this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (iii) has determined to recommend that the stockholders of
Parent approve the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger as
contemplated by this Agreement (the recommendation referred in this clause
(iii) is referred to in this Agreement as the "Parent Recommendation");  
WHEREAS, (i) the Board of Managers of Merger Sub has (a) determined that the
Merger is in the best interests of, and advisable to, Merger Sub and Parent,
as its sole member, (b) approved and adopted this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (d) has determined
to recommend that Parent, as the sole member of Merger Sub, approve this
Agreement and (ii) Parent, as the sole member of Merger Sub, will,
immediately after the execution and delivery hereof, approve, adopt and
declare advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and   WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various
conditions to the Merger.   NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing
and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
hereinafter set forth, the parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally
bound, agree as follows:    SECTION 1 THE MERGER.   1.1 MERGER OF THE
COMPANY INTO MERGER SUB.   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3),
the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, and the separate
corporate existence of the Company shall cease. Merger Sub will continue as
the surviving entity in the Merger (the "Surviving Entity") and will be a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.   1.2 EFFECT OF THE MERGER.   The
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA.   1.3 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME.   The
consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Heller Ehrman LLP, 275 Middlefield Road, Menlo Park, California at 10:00 a.m.
on a date to be mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company (the "Closing
Date"), which date shall be no later than the third business day after the
conditions set forth in Section 6 shall have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or
such other time as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree. Subject to
the provisions of this Agreement, the parties shall cause the Merger to
become effective by causing Merger Sub to execute and file in accordance with
the DGCL and the DLLCA a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware (the "Certificate of Merger"). The Merger shall
become effective upon such filing, or at such later date and time set forth
in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").   1.4 LIMITED
LIABILITY COMPANY OPERATING AGREEMENT.   (a) The Limited Liability Company
Operating Agreement of the Merger Sub in effect as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be the Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement
of the Surviving Entity following the Effective Time; provided, however, that
the Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement shall be amended to change
the name of the Surviving Entity to "RITA Medical Systems, LLC".   (b) The
managers and officers of the Surviving Entity shall be the respective
individuals who are the managers and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time.   1.5 EFFECT OF THE MERGER.   (a) At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Company Stockholder, subject to
Section 1.5(b), Section 1.5(c), Section 1.5(d), and Section 1.9 each share of
Company Common Stock then issued and outstanding, other than Excluded Shares
and Dissenting Shares, if any, shall be converted into the right to
receive:   (i) 0.1722 of a fully paid and nonassessable share of Parent
Common Stock (the "Per Share Stock Merger Consideration"); and    2   
(ii) if the Parent Common Stock Price is less than or equal to $27.29 and
greater than or equal to $18.18, an amount of cash equal to $4.70 less the
Per Share Stock Merger Consideration Value; and   (iii) if Parent Common
Stock Price is less than $18.18, an amount of cash equal to $1.57.   (b)
If, on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are
changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock
split, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, including
any such transaction with a record date between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted to the extent the record date for any such event is between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, so as to provide the holders of
Company Common Stock and Parent the same economic effect as contemplated
prior to such stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction.   (c) At
the Effective Time, each Excluded Share shall be cancelled and extinguished
without any conversion or payment therefor.   (d) No fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and no
certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares shall be issued, and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or to any rights as a holder of Parent Common Stock. Any holder of Company
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, in
lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender of such holder\'s Company
Stock Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 1.6), be paid in cash the dollar
amount (rounded up to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) that fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock to which such stockholder would otherwise be entitled (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable
to such holder) by (B) the Parent Common Stock Price. Alternatively, Parent
shall have the option of instructing the Exchange Agent to aggregate all
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, sell such shares in the public
market and distribute to holders of Company Common Stock who otherwise would
have been entitled to such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock a pro
rata portion of the proceeds of such sale.   1.6 CLOSING OF THE COMPANY\'S
TRANSFER BOOKS.   At the Effective Time: (a) all shares of Company Common
Stock ("Shares") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, each share of
Company Common Stock shall represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and all holders of certificates representing Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed with respect to all Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such
Shares shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any
Shares (a "Company Stock Certificate") is presented to the Exchange Agent (as
defined in Section 1.7) or to the Surviving Entity or Parent, such Company
Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in
this Section 1.    3    1.7 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.   (a) Prior to
the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint its transfer agent for the Parent
Common Stock to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent").
Within two business days after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, (i)
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant
to this Section 1, and (ii) cash representing the Cash Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to this Section 1 (such cash and shares of Parent Common
Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto,
being referred to as the "Exchange Fund").   (b) As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, and in any event within two business days following
receipt of the list of record holders of certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock ("Company Stock Certificates") as of the close of
business on the Closing Date from the transfer agent for the Company Common
Stock, the Exchange Agent will mail to the record holders of Company Stock
Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing
such provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify (including a
provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange
Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company
Stock Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender
of a Company Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together
with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, (A) the holder of such
Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration, and (B) the Company Stock Certificate so
surrendered shall be immediately canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 1.7, each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any distribution or dividend the record date for which is
after the Effective Time. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificates, the Merger
Consideration; provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance of any certificate representing
Parent Common Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver
a bond (in such reasonable sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Entity with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.   (c) No
dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the Merger until such holder surrenders such Company
Stock Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.7.   (d) Any portion of
the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Company Stock
Certificates as of the date one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock
Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock
Certificates to the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall
thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for the
Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant hereto,
subject to applicable abandoned property law, escheat laws or similar Legal
Requirements.   (e) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Entity shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement    4   to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock
such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any
other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.   (f) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity
shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to
any other Person with respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts,
properly delivered to any public official in compliance with any applicable
abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.   1.8
FURTHER ACTION.   If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Entity with full right,
title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the
Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Entity and Parent shall
be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company
and otherwise) to take such action. Parent, Merger Sub and Surviving Entity
also shall take such further actions as may be necessary or desirable to
ensure that the Exchange Agent sends out the letters of transmittal to the
stockholders of the Company and issues certificates representing Parent
Common Stock to such stockholders in accordance with Section 1.7.   1.9
APPRAISAL RIGHTS.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article
1, in the event that any Cash Merger Consideration is included in the
Merger Consideration, any shares of the Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a Person who has not
voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and who has demanded
appraisal for such shares in accordance with the DGCL (the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise
loses its rights to appraisal of it is determined that such holder does not
have appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL. If such holder fails to
timely perfect or withdraws the demand for appraisal, or it is determined
that such holder does not have appraisal rights, such shares shall be treated
as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall serve prompt notice to
Parent of any notice of intent to demand appraisal, or any demand for
payment, received by the Company and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.   1.10 TAX CONSEQUENCES.   For federal income tax purposes, the
Merger is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368 of the Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this
Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations. Parent,
the Company and Merger Sub have taken no actions and will take no actions,
nor have they failed to take any actions or will they fail to take any
actions, either before or after the Closing, which could reasonably be
expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub (as the Surviving Entity) shall report the Merger
for    5   income tax purposes as a reorganization and will take no
position in any Tax Return or Tax proceeding inconsistent with treatment of
the Merger as a reorganization.  SECTION 2 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
OF THE COMPANY.   Except as disclosed in Company SEC Documents filed prior
to the date hereof or the Disclosure Letter delivered by the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement
(the "Company Disclosure Letter") and referred to in the section of the
Company Disclosure Letter corresponding to the section(s) of this Section 2
to which such disclosure applies (unless it is reasonably apparent from the
face of such disclosure that the disclosure or statement in one section of
the Company Disclosure Letter should apply to one or more sections thereof),
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:   2.1 DUE ORGANIZATION; SUBSIDIARIES.   The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Legal Requirements of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, and each of the
other Acquired Corporations which is a "significant subsidiary" (as defined
in Regulation S-X) of the Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Legal Requirements of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation. Each of the Acquired
Corporations has all necessary power and authority: (a) to conduct its
business in the manner in which its business is currently being conducted;
(b) to own and use its assets in the manner in which its assets are currently
owned and used; and (c) to perform its material obligations under all Company
Material Contracts. Each of the Acquired Corporations is qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing, under the
Legal Requirements of all jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified
would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations. The
Company has delivered or made available to Parent accurate and complete
copies of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other charter or
organizational documents of each of the Acquired Corporations, including all
amendments thereto (collectively, the "Company Organization Documents"). The
Company has no Subsidiaries, except for the corporations identified in
Schedule 2.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the "Acquired
Corporations". None of the Acquired Corporations has any equity interest or
similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any Entity, other than the
Acquired Corporations\' interests in their Subsidiaries identified in
Schedule 2.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter.   2.2 AUTHORITY; BINDING
NATURE OF AGREEMENT.   The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into and, subject to the receipt of the stockholder
approval contemplated by Section 5.2, to perform its obligations under this
Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to (a) Legal Requirements of general application relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors, (b) rules of law governing
specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies and (c)
the approval of stockholders of the Company. The Company hereby represents
that its Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held on or prior to
the date hereof, has by unanimous vote (i) determined that the Merger is in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved,
adopted and declared advisable this Agreement, (iii) approved the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) determined to
make the Company Recommendation to the stockholders of the Company.   
6    2.3 CAPITALIZATION, ETC.   (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 150,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 2,000,000

Preferred Stock. As of November 24, 2006, 43,248,964 shares of Company Common
Stock have been issued or are outstanding and no shares of the Company
Preferred Stock have been issued or are outstanding. No shares of Company
Common Stock are held in the Company\'s treasury or are held by any of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries. All of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued, and are fully paid and
nonassessable. None of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is
entitled or subject to any preemptive right, right of participation, right of
maintenance or any similar right or subject to any right of first refusal in
favor of the Company. There is no Contract to which the Company is a party
and, to the Company\'s knowledge, there is no Contract between other Persons,
relating to the voting or registration of, or restricting any Person from
purchasing, selling, pledging or otherwise disposing of, any shares of
Company Common Stock. None of the Acquired Corporations is under any
obligation, or is bound by any Contract pursuant to which it may become
obligated, to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock.   (b) As of November 24, 2006, 5,876,746 shares of

knowledge of the Company, any other Person, in the past three (3) years. The
Acquired Corporation Proprietary Assets constitute all the Proprietary Assets
necessary to enable each of the Acquired Corporations to conduct its business
in the manner in which such business is currently being conducted. Upon the
consummation of the Merger, the Surviving Entity shall have good, valid, and
enforceable title, or license (if the applicable Acquired Corporations
Proprietary Asset is licensed to an Acquired Corporation) to all Acquired
Corporation Proprietary Assets, free and clear of all Encumbrances and on,
and subject to, the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior

any third party or (iv) the Acquired Corporations being required under a
Contract to procure or attempt to procure from Parent or any of
its subsidiaries a license grant to or covenant not to assert in favor of
any Person. As used in this Section 2.7(d), an "incremental" right, non-
compete, restriction, royalty or discount refers to a right, non-compete,
restriction, royalty or discount, as applicable, in excess, whether in terms

contemplated hereby.   (e) With respect to the use of software in the
business of each of the Acquired Corporations as such business is currently

breaches in any of the Acquired Corporations\' information technology
systems, and there have been no disruptions in any of the Acquired

implemented plans and systems that reasonably address their assessment of
risk.   (f) All products of the Acquired Corporations ("Company Product")
conform in all material respects with all applicable contractual commitments
and all express and implied warranties, the Acquired Corporations\' published
product specifications and with all regulations, certification standards and
other requirements of any applicable governmental entity or third party. The
channel activities of the Acquired Corporations related to sales
or distribution of Company Products conform in all material respects with
all applicable contractual commitments. The Acquired Corporations have no
liability (whether known or unknown, asserted or unasserted, absolute or
contingent, accrued or unaccrued, liquidated or unliquidated, due or to
become due or otherwise) for replacement or modification of any Company
Product or other damages in connection therewith other than in the ordinary
course of business. There are no known material defects in the design or
technology embodied in any Company Product which impair or are likely to
impair the intended use of such Company Product. There is no presently
pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there is no basis for, any civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, demands, claims, hearings, notices of
violation, investigations, proceedings or demand letters relating to any
alleged hazard or alleged defect in design, manufacture, materials or
workmanship, including any failure to warn or alleged breach of express or
implied warranty or representation, relating to any Company Product. None of

of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of
debtors, and (B) rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive
relief and other equitable remedies, except to the extent they have expired

material respects with the terms and requirements of such Governmental
Authorizations. None of the Acquired Corporations has received any notice or
other communication from any Governmental Body regarding (a) any actual or

Each of the Acquired Corporations has paid or provided adequate reserves, in

the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth as of the date of this Agreement a
complete and accurate list of current open audits of Tax Returns filed by or
on behalf of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries with any Governmental
Body.   (e) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
(i) did not, as of the date of the most recent Company Financial Statements,
exceed the reserve for Tax Liability (as opposed to any reserve for deferred
Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income)
set forth in the Company Balance Sheet and (ii) will not exceed that reserve
as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance
with the past custom and practice of the Acquired Corporations in filing
their Tax Returns other than any Taxes which the failure to pay would not,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect on the
Acquired Corporations.   (f) None of the Acquired Corporations is a party to
any Tax allocation or sharing agreement. None of the Acquired Corporations

holding corporation within the meaning of Code Section 897(c)(2).   (h) The

any affiliate of the Company has taken or agreed to take any action or knows
of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger

the Code.   2.13 EMPLOYEE AND LABOR MATTERS; BENEFIT PLANS.   (a) Schedule
2.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists as of the date of this

otherwise provided in this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not (either solely as a result thereof or

Acquired Corporations\' compliance in all material respects with
any Environmental Law, or which would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any material liability of the Company or any of the Acquired Corporations
under any Environmental Law. Within the past seven years, none of the
Acquired Corporations has received any written notice, or to its knowledge,
other communication (in writing or otherwise) that alleges that any of the
Acquired Corporations is not in material compliance with any Environmental
Law, and the Company has no knowledge of any circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to result in such claims or communications. To the
Company\'s knowledge, no current or prior owner of any property owned, leased
or controlled by any of the Acquired Corporations has received any   
24   written notice or other communication (in writing or otherwise) that
alleges that such current or prior owner or any of the Acquired Corporations
is not in compliance with any Environmental Law in such a manner as would be
reasonably likely to result in a material liability or clean up obligation on
any Acquired Corporation. Neither the Company nor any of the Acquired
Corporations has assumed by contract, agreement or otherwise any liabilities
or obligations arising under any Environmental Law, or is currently
performing any required investigation, response or other corrective action
under any Environmental Law. There are no underground storage tanks or
related piping on any property owned, leased, controlled by or used by any of
the Acquired Corporations, and any former such tanks and piping have been
removed or closed in accordance with applicable Environmental Laws. To the
Company\'s knowledge, all property that is owned by, leased to, controlled by
or used by any of the Acquired Corporations is free of any friable asbestos
or asbestos-containing material.   2.15 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS; ORDERS.  
Except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents or in Schedule 2.15 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, there is no pending Legal Proceeding and, to the
Company\'s knowledge, within the past 24 months no Person has threatened in
writing to commence any Legal Proceeding, that involves any of the Acquired
Corporations or any of the assets owned or used by any of the Acquired
Corporations, in each case which would be reasonably likely to be material to
the Acquired Corporations; and there is no Order to which any of the Acquired
Corporations, or any of the material assets owned or used by any of the
Acquired Corporations, is subject.   2.16 VOTE REQUIRED.   The affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding on the record date for the Company Stockholders\' Meeting is the
only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Company\'s capital
stock necessary to approve this Agreement and otherwise approve and
consummate the Merger as set forth herein.   2.17 FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES
ACT.   Neither the Company, any other Acquired Corporation, any of the
Acquired Corporation\'s officers, directors, nor, to the
Company\'s knowledge, any employees or agents, distributors, representatives
or other persons acting on the express, implied or apparent authority of any
Acquired Corporation, have paid, given or received or have offered or
promised to pay, give or receive, any bribe or other unlawful payment of
money or other thing of value, any unlawful discount, or any other unlawful
inducement, to or from any person or Governmental Body in the United States
or elsewhere in connection with or in furtherance of the business of any of
the Acquired Corporations (including any unlawful offer, payment or promise
to pay money or other thing of value (a) to any foreign official, political
party (or official thereof) or candidate for political office for the
purposes of influencing any act, decision or omission in order to assist any
Acquired Corporation in obtaining business for or with, or directing business
to, any person, or (b) to any person, while knowing that all or a portion of
such money or other thing of value will be offered, given or promised
unlawfully to any such official or party for such purposes). Neither the
business of the Company nor of any other Acquired Corporation is in any
manner dependent upon the making or receipt of such unlawful payments,
discounts or other inducements. Neither the Company nor any other Acquired
Corporation has otherwise taken any action that could cause the Company or
any other Acquired Corporation to be in violation of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the regulations thereunder, or
any applicable Legal Requirements of similar effect.    25    2.18 REAL
PROPERTY.   Except as set forth in Schedule 2.18 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company has good and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold
interest in, all of its real properties, in each case free and clear of all
Encumbrances. Schedule 2.18 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
true, correct and complete list of all real property owned by the
Acquired Corporations at any time during the past five years and a true and
correct list of all real property currently leased by each of the Acquired
Corporations identifying, with respect to each lease of such real property,
the date of, the parties to, and any amendments, modifications, extensions or
other supplements to such lease. No Acquired Corporation has sent or received
any written notice of any default under any of the leases of real property to
which it is party. No Acquired Corporation is in material breach of, or in
default in any material respect under, any covenant, agreement, term or
condition of or contained in any lease of real property to which it is a
party and there has not occurred any event that with the lapse of time or the
giving of notice or both could constitute such a default or breach.   2.19
INSURANCE POLICIES.   The Company has delivered to Parent prior to the date
hereof a complete and accurate list of all insurance policies in force naming
the Company, any of the other Acquired Corporations or any director, officer
or employee thereof as an insured or beneficiary or as a loss payable payee
or for which the Company or any other Acquired Corporation has paid or is
obligated to pay all or part of the premiums. Neither the Company nor any
other Acquired Corporation has received notice of any pending or threatened
cancellation or premium increase (retroactive or otherwise) with respect
thereto, and each of the Acquired Corporations is in compliance in all
material respects with all conditions contained therein. There are no
material pending claims against such insurance policies by the Company or any
other Acquired Corporation as to which insurers are defending under
reservation of rights or have denied liability, and there exists no material
claim under such insurance policies that has not been properly filed by the
Company or any other Acquired Corporation. Except for the self-insurance
retentions or deductibles set forth in the policies contained in the
aforementioned list, the policies are adequate in scope and amount to cover
all prudent and reasonably foreseeable risks which may arise in the conduct
of the business of the Acquired Corporations that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations.

applications, Internet domain names, computer software (other than third
party software generally available for sale to the public) and fictitious
name and assumed name registrations owned by any of the AngioDynamics
Corporations, (ii) all patent applications and other Proprietary Assets that
are currently in the name of inventors or other Persons and for which an
AngioDynamics Corporation has the right to receive an assignment and (iii)
all material third party licenses for Proprietary Assets to which an
AngioDynamics Corporation is the licensee party and which are not set forth
on Schedule 3.8(a)(iii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter. Each AngioDynamics
Corporation has good, valid and marketable title to, or has a   
33   valid right to use, license or otherwise exploit, all of the
material AngioDynamics Corporation Proprietary Assets necessary for the
conduct of such AngioDynamics Corporation\'s business as presently conducted,
free and clear of all Encumbrances. None of the AngioDynamics Corporations
has developed jointly with any other Person any material AngioDynamics
Corporation Proprietary Asset with respect to which such other Person has any
rights. Other than the Material AngioDynamics Corporations IP Contracts and
the Contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with
prior practice that are not, with respect to any individual Contract,
material to the AngioDynamics Corporations, there is no AngioDynamics
Corporation Contract pursuant to which any Person has any right (whether or
not currently exercisable) to use, license or otherwise exploit any
AngioDynamics Corporation Proprietary Asset owned or exclusively licensed by
any of the AngioDynamics Corporations.   (b) (i) All AngioDynamics
Corporation Proprietary Assets owned by any of the AngioDynamics Corporations
are subsisting and in effect, and to the Parent\'s knowledge, valid and
enforceable; (ii) none of the AngioDynamics Corporation Proprietary Assets
and no Proprietary Asset that is currently being developed or reduced to
practice or which is the subject of a current invention disclosure by any of
the AngioDynamics Corporations (either by itself or with any other Person)
infringes, misappropriates, conflicts with or otherwise violates any
Proprietary Asset owned or used by any other Person; (iii) none of the
products or services that is or has been designed, created, developed,
assembled, performed, manufactured, sold, marketed or licensed by any of the
AngioDynamics Corporations is infringing, misappropriating or making any
unlawful or unauthorized use of any Proprietary Asset owned or used by
any other Person, and none of such products or services has at any time
infringed, misappropriated or made any unlawful or unauthorized use of, and
none of the AngioDynamics Corporations has received in the past three (3)
years any written, or to Parent\'s knowledge, oral notice or of any actual,
alleged, possible or potential infringement, misappropriation or unlawful
or unauthorized use of, any Proprietary Asset owned or used by any other
Person; (iv) the operation of the business of each AngioDynamics Corporation
as it currently is conducted does not, and will not when conducted
immediately following the Closing, infringe or misappropriate or make any
unlawful or unauthorized use of any Proprietary Asset of any other Person;
and (v) to Parent\'s knowledge, no other Person is infringing,
misappropriating or making any unlawful or unauthorized use of, and no
Proprietary Asset owned or used by any other Person infringes or conflicts
with, any AngioDynamics Corporation Proprietary Asset, and no such claims
have been asserted or threatened against any Person by Parent or, to the
knowledge of Parent, any other Person, in the past three (3) years. The
AngioDynamics Corporation Proprietary Assets constitute all the Proprietary
Assets necessary to enable each of the AngioDynamics Corporations to conduct
its business in the manner in which such business is currently being
conducted. None of the AngioDynamics Corporations has entered into any
covenant not to compete or any Contract limiting its ability to exploit fully
any AngioDynamics Corporation Proprietary Assets owned or licensed by such
AngioDynamics Corporation or to transact business in any market or
geographical area or with any Person.   (c) Each AngioDynamics Corporation
has taken all reasonable steps that are required to protect such
AngioDynamics Corporation\'s rights in confidential information and trade
secrets of the AngioDynamics Corporation or provided by any other Person to
the AngioDynamics Corporation. Without limiting the foregoing, each
AngioDynamics Corporation has, and enforces, a policy requiring each
employee, consultant and contractor to execute a proprietary information and
confidentiality agreement, substantially in the forms previously made
available to the Company and listed on Schedule 3.7(c) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, and all current and former employees, consultants
and contractors of such AngioDynamics Corporation have executed such an
agreement.   (d) Neither this Agreement nor the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will result in: (i) the Company, any of its
affiliates or the Surviving Entity granting to any third party any
incremental right to or with respect to or non-assertion under any
Proprietary Assets owned by, or    34   licensed to, any of them, (ii)
the Company, any of its affiliates or the Surviving Entity, being bound by,
or subject to, any incremental non-compete or other incremental material
restriction on the operation or scope of their respective businesses, (iii)
the Company, any of its affiliates or the Surviving Entity being obligated to
pay any incremental royalties or other material amounts, or offer any
incremental discounts, to any third party or (iv) the AngioDynamics
Corporations being required under a Contract to procure or attempt to procure
from the Company or any of its subsidiaries a license grant to or covenant
not to assert in favor of any Person. As used in this Section 3.7(d), an
"incremental" right, non-compete, restriction, royalty or discount refers to
a right, non-compete, restriction, royalty or discount, as applicable, in
excess, whether in terms of contractual term, contractual rate or scope, of
those that would have been required to be offered or granted, as applicable,
had the parties to this Agreement not entered into this Agreement or
consummated the transactions contemplated hereby.   (e) With respect to the
use of software in the business of each of the AngioDynamics Corporations as
such business is currently conducted, to the knowledge of Parent, no such
software contains defects in its operation or any device or feature designed
to disrupt, disable, or otherwise impair the functioning of any software.
Such software has been validated for its use. There have been no material
security breaches in any of the AngioDynamics Corporations\' information
technology systems, and there have been no disruptions in any of the
AngioDynamics Corporations\' information technology systems that materially
adversely affected such AngioDynamics Corporations\' business or operations.
Each AngioDynamics Corporation has evaluated their disaster recovery and
backup needs and have implemented plans and systems that reasonably address
their assessment of risk.   (f) All products of the AngioDynamics
Corporations ("AngioDynamics Product") conform in all material respects with
all applicable contractual commitments and all express and implied
warranties, the AngioDynamics Corporations\' published product specifications
and with all regulations, certification standards and other requirements of
any applicable governmental entity or third party. The channel activities of
the AngioDynamics Corporations related to sales or distribution of
AngioDynamics Products conform in all material respects with all applicable
contractual commitments. The AngioDynamics Corporations have no liability
(whether known or unknown, asserted or unasserted, absolute or contingent,
accrued or unaccrued, liquidated or unliquidated, due or to become due or
otherwise) for replacement or modification of any AngioDynamics Product or
other damages in connection therewith other than in the ordinary course of
business. There are no known material defects in the design or technology
embodied in any AngioDynamics Product which impair or are likely to impair
the intended use of such AngioDynamics Product. There is no presently
pending, or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, and, to the knowledge of
Parent, there is no basis for, any civil, criminal or administrative actions,
suits, demands, claims, hearings, notices of violation, investigations,
proceedings or demand letters relating to any alleged hazard or alleged
defect in design, manufacture, materials or workmanship, including any
failure to warn or alleged breach of express or implied warranty or
representation, relating to any AngioDynamics Product. None of the
AngioDynamics Corporations have extended to any of its customers any written
product warranties, indemnifications or guarantees that deviate in
any material respect from the standard product warranties,
indemnification arrangements or guarantees of the AngioDynamics
Corporations.   3.8 CONTRACTS.    35    (a) For purposes of this

Contract, if a breach of such AngioDynamics Corporation Contract could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the AngioDynamics
Corporations.   (b) Each Parent Material Contract is valid and in full
force and effect, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms subject to
(A) Legal Requirements of general application relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency and the relief of debtors, and (B) rules of law governing specific
performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies, except to the
extent they have expired in accordance with    36   their terms and
except where the failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to the
AngioDynamics Corporations. Parent has delivered to or made available to the
Company true and complete copies of each Parent Material Contract, except in
the case of a Parent Material Contract which is derived from a standard form
agreement of the AngioDynamics Corporations, Parent has delivered to or made

Parent Permits are in full force and effect and no suspension or cancellation
of any of Parent Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened, except where the failure to have, or the suspension or
cancellation of,    37   any of Parent Permits would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the AngioDynamics
Corporations. Except for conflicts, defaults or violations which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
the AngioDynamics Corporations, no AngioDynamics Corporation is in conflict
with, or in violation or default of, (i) any law applicable to such

GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS.   Each of the AngioDynamics Corporations holds
all Governmental Authorizations necessary to enable such AngioDynamics
Corporation to conduct its business in the manner in which such business is
currently being conducted except where the failure to hold such Governmental
Authorizations would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the AngioDynamics Corporations. All such Governmental
Authorizations are valid and in full force and effect. Each AngioDynamics
Corporation is in compliance in all material respects with the terms and
requirements of such Governmental Authorizations. None of the AngioDynamics
Corporations has received any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Body regarding (a) any actual or possible violation of or
failure to comply in any material respect with any term or requirement of any
Governmental Authorization, or (b) any actual or possible revocation,
withdrawal, suspension, cancellation, termination or modification of any
Governmental Authorization.    40    3.12 TAX MATTERS.   (a) The
AngioDynamics Corporations have paid or provided adequate reserves, in

for or with respect to all periods up to and including the date hereof
whether or not such Taxes were shown on any Tax Return and without regard to
whether such Taxes are or were disputed.   (b) Each of the AngioDynamics
Corporations has filed on a timely basis (taking into account any extensions
of time an AngioDynamics Corporation was granted) all income Tax Returns and
all other material Tax Returns that each was required to file. None of the

time within which to file any Tax Return. No claim that has not been resolved
has ever been made to an AngioDynamics Corporation by an authority in a
jurisdiction where the AngioDynamics Corporations do not file Tax Returns
that any one of them is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.
None of the AngioDynamics Corporations has given any currently effective
waiver of any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any
currently effective extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency. None of the AngioDynamics Corporations has granted to any Person
any power of attorney that is currently in force with respect to any Tax
matter. There are no security interests on any of the assets of any of the
AngioDynamics Corporations that arose in connection with any failure (or
alleged failure) to pay any Tax (other than liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable).   (c) The AngioDynamics Corporations have withheld and paid
all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection
with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor,
creditor, stockholder or other third party.   (d) There is no dispute or
claim concerning any liability for Taxes of the AngioDynamics Corporations
either (i) claimed or raised by any authority in writing or (ii) as to which
such AngioDynamics Corporation has knowledge based upon personal contact with
any agent of such authority. Schedule 3.12(d) to the Parent Disclosure Letter
sets forth as of the date of this Agreement a complete and accurate list of
current open audits of Tax Returns filed by or on behalf of the AngioDynamics
Corporations with any Governmental Body.   (e) The unpaid Taxes of the
AngioDynamics Corporations (i) did not, as of the date of the most recent
Parent Financial Statements, exceed the reserve for Tax Liability (as opposed
to any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) set forth in the Parent Balance Sheet and (ii)
will not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the
Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of the
AngioDynamics Corporations in filing their Tax Returns other than any Taxes
which the failure to pay would not, individually or in the aggregate, result
in a Material Adverse Effect on the AngioDynamics Corporations.   (f) None
of the AngioDynamics Corporations is a party to any Tax allocation or sharing
agreement. None of the AngioDynamics Corporations (i) has been a member of an
"affiliated group," as defined in Section 1504(a) of the Code, filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return other than an affiliated group the
common parent of which is Parent or (ii) has any Liability for the Taxes of
any Person (other than any of the AngioDynamics Corporations) under Treas.
Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign
law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.   (g) Parent
has made available to the Company or its legal or accounting representative
copies of all foreign, federal and state income tax Returns for Parent and
each of its subsidiaries filed for all periods including and after the tax
period ended May 31, 2004.    41    (h) Neither Parent nor any affiliate
of Parent has taken or agreed to take any action or knows of any fact or
circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

this Section 3.13(a) shall apply to (i) all material employee pension benefit
plans (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), (ii) all material employee

deferred compensation, supplemental retirement, severance, fringe benefits
and other similar benefit plans (including any material fringe benefit under

common control with any of the AngioDynamics Corporations within the meaning
of Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001(a) (14) or
(b) of ERISA (each, a "Parent ERISA Affiliate") for the benefit of, or

the subject of a current favorable determination letter from the Internal

(or comparable letter, such as an opinion or notification letter as to the
form of plan adopted by one or more AngioDynamics Corporations), or has time
remaining under applicable Treasury guidance to seek such a determination,

might impair such favorable determination or otherwise impair the qualified
status of such plan.   (c) None of the AngioDynamics Corporations or any

the Code or Title IV of ERISA.   (d) The consummation of the transactions

Corporations.   (e) There are no material Legal Proceedings pending or,

any related federal, state, foreign or administrative agency or court,

MATTERS.   Each of the AngioDynamics Corporations is in compliance
with, and has conducted its activities in compliance with, all
applicable Environmental Laws, which compliance includes the possession by
each of the AngioDynamics Corporations of all material permits and other
Governmental Authorizations required under applicable Environmental Laws, and
compliance with the terms and conditions thereof, except where the failure to
so comply would not result in a material liability or clean up obligation on
the AngioDynamics Corporations. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not affect the validity of such material
permits and Governmental Authorizations held by Parent or any of the
AngioDynamics Corporations, and will not require any filing, notice, or
remediation under any Environmental law. To the knowledge of Parent, there
are no past or present events, conditions, activities, or practices which
would reasonably be expected to prevent Parent\'s or any of the AngioDynamics
Corporations\' compliance in any material respect with any Environmental Law,
or which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any material liability
of Parent or any of the AngioDynamics Corporations under any Environmental
Law. Within the past seven years, none of the AngioDynamics Corporations has
received any written notice, or to its knowledge, other communication (in
writing or otherwise) that alleges that any of the AngioDynamics Corporations
is not in material compliance with any Environmental Law, and Parent has no
knowledge of any circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in
such claims or communications. To Parent\'s knowledge, no current or prior
owner of any property owned, leased or controlled by any of the AngioDynamics
Corporations has received any written notice or other communication   
44   (in writing or otherwise) that alleges that such current or prior
owner or any of the AngioDynamics Corporations is not in compliance with any
Environmental Law in such a manner as would be reasonably likely to would not
result in a material liability or clean up obligation on any AngioDynamics
Corporation. Neither Parent nor any of the AngioDynamics Corporations has
assumed by contract, agreement or otherwise any liabilities or obligations
arising under any Environmental Law, or is currently performing any required
investigation, response or other corrective action under any Environmental
Law. There are no underground storage tanks or related piping on any property
owned, leased, controlled by or used by any of the AngioDynamics
Corporations, and any former such tanks and piping have been removed or
closed in accordance with applicable Environmental Laws. To Parent\'s
knowledge, all property that is owned by, leased to, controlled by or used by
any of the AngioDynamics Corporations is free of any friable asbestos or
asbestos-containing material.   3.15 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS; ORDERS.   Except
as set forth in the Parent SEC Documents, there is no pending Legal
Proceeding and, to Parent\'s knowledge, within the past 24 months no Person
has threatened in writing to commence any Legal Proceeding, that involves any
of the AngioDynamics Corporations or any of the assets owned or used by any
of the AngioDynamics Corporations, in each case which would be reasonably
likely to be material to the AngioDynamics Corporations; and there is no
Order to which any of the AngioDynamics Corporations, or any of the material
assets owned or used by any of the AngioDynamics Corporations,
is subject.   3.16 VOTE REQUIRED.   (a) The affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes cast on the proposal to approve the issuance of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to the Merger is the only vote of the holders of any
class or series of Parent\'s capital stock necessary to approve the issuance
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger.   (b) The affirmative vote
of Parent is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Merger
Sub\'s equity interests necessary to approve this Agreement and otherwise
approve and consummate the Merger as set forth herein.   3.17 FOREIGN
CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT.   Neither Parent, any other AngioDynamics
Corporation, any of the AngioDynamics Corporation\'s officers, directors,
nor, to Parent\'s knowledge, any employees or agents, distributors,
representatives or other persons acting on the express, implied or apparent
authority of any AngioDynamics Corporation, have paid, given or received or
have offered or promised to pay, give or receive, any bribe or other unlawful
payment of money or other thing of value, any unlawful discount, or any other
unlawful inducement, to or from any person or Governmental Body in the United
States or elsewhere in connection with or in furtherance of the business of
any of the AngioDynamics Corporations (including any unlawful offer, payment
or promise to pay money or other thing of value (a) to any foreign official,
political party (or official thereof) or candidate for political office for
the purposes of influencing any act, decision or omission in order to assist
any AngioDynamics Corporation in obtaining business for or with, or directing
business to, any person, or (b) to any person, while knowing that all or a
portion of    45   such money or other thing of value will be offered,
given or promised unlawfully to any such official or party for such
purposes). Neither the business of Parent nor of any other AngioDynamics
Corporation is in any manner dependent upon the making or receipt of such
unlawful payments, discounts or other inducements. Neither Parent nor any
other AngioDynamics Corporation has otherwise taken any action that could
cause Parent or any other AngioDynamics Corporation to be in violation of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the regulations
thereunder, or any applicable Legal Requirements of similar effect.   3.18
REAL PROPERTY.   Parent has good and marketable title to, or a valid
leasehold interest in, all of its real properties, in each case free and
clear of all Encumbrances. The AngioDynamics Corporations have not owned any
real property at any time during the past five years. No AngioDynamics
Corporation has sent or received any written notice of any default under any
of the leases of real property to which it is party. No AngioDynamics
Corporation is in material breach of, or in default in any material respect
under, any covenant, agreement, term or condition of or contained in any
lease of real property to which it is a party and there has not occurred any
event that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both could
constitute such a default or breach.   3.19 INSURANCE POLICIES.   Neither
Parent nor any other AngioDynamics Corporation has received notice of any
pending or threatened cancellation or premium increase (retroactive or
otherwise) with respect thereto, and each of the AngioDynamics Corporations
is in compliance in all material respects with all conditions contained
therein. There are no material pending claims against such insurance policies
by Parent or any other AngioDynamics Corporation as to which insurers are
defending under reservation of rights or have denied liability, and
there exists no material claim under such insurance policies that has not
been properly filed by Parent or any other AngioDynamics Corporation. Except
for the self-insurance retentions or deductibles, the policies are adequate
in scope and amount to cover all prudent and reasonably foreseeable risks
which may arise in the conduct of the business of the AngioDynamics
Corporations that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the AngioDynamics Corporations.   3.20 INFORMATION TO BE
SUPPLIED.   None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or
on behalf of Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement is
filed with the SEC or becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on
behalf of Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Parent
Proxy Statement or the Company Proxy Statement will, at the time the Parent
Proxy Statement or the Company Proxy Statement is mailed to the stockholders
of Parent or the stockholders of the Company, as the case may be, or at the
time of the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting or the Company\'s Stockholders\'
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. The Parent Proxy Statement will comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent makes no representation or warranty with respect to any
information supplied by or to be supplied by the Company that is included or
incorporated by reference in the foregoing documents.    46    3.21
TAKEOVER STATUTES; RIGHTS PLAN.   (a) To Parent\'s knowledge, no Takeover
Laws (other than Section 203 of the DGCL) are applicable to the Merger, this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. The action of the
Board of Directors of Parent in approving this Agreement (and the
transactions provided for herein) is sufficient to render inapplicable to
this Agreement (and the transactions provided for herein) the restrictions on
"business combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) as set forth
in Section 203 of the DGCL.   (b) No "Stock Acquisition Date" or
"Distribution Date" (as such terms are defined in the Parent Rights Plan)
will occur as a result of the execution of this Agreement or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the consummation of the
Merger. The Parent Rights Plan, as so amended, has not been further amended
or modified.  3.22 FINANCIAL ADVISOR.   Except with respect to Cain
Brothers and Company, LLC ("Cain Brothers"), no broker, finder or investment
banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder\'s or other fee or commission in
connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of any of the
AngioDynamics Corporations. Parent has furnished to the Company an accurate
and complete copy of its agreement with Cain Brothers.   3.23 OPINION OF
FINANCIAL ADVISOR.   The Parent\'s Board of Directors has received the
opinion of Cain Brothers, financial advisor to Parent, that as of the date of

financial point of view. Parent will furnish an accurate and complete copy of
said opinion to the Company.   3.24 AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS.   Schedule
3.24 of the Parent Disclosure Letter contains a complete and correct list, as
of the date of this Agreement, of all agreements, contracts, transfers of
assets or liabilities or other commitments or transactions, whether or not
entered into in the ordinary course of business, to or by which the

officers or directors (or any of their respective Affiliates, other than any
AngioDynamics Corporation) on the other hand, are or have been a party or
otherwise bound or affected, and that (a) are currently pending, in effect or
have been in effect during the past 12 months, (b) involve
continuing liabilities and obligations that, individually or in the

2006, between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which
will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.   4.2

furnishing nonpublic information regarding the Acquired Corporations to, or
entering into or participating in discussions or negotiations with, any
Person in response to an unsolicited, bona fide written Company Acquisition
Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors, would reasonably be expected
to result in a Company Superior Offer if (1) none of the Acquired
Corporations or any Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations shall
have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.3(a) in
connection with the receipt of such Company Acquisition Proposal, (2) the
Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation

Company\'s Board of Directors not to withhold, withdraw or modify its
recommendation except as expressly set forth in Section 4.3(d), the Company
from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act
with regard to any Company Acquisition Proposal.    52    (b) The
Company shall promptly, and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours
after its receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or similar inquiry, or
any request for nonpublic information relating to any of the Acquired
Corporations in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal or similar
inquiry, advise Parent orally and in writing of such Company Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request (including providing the identity of the Person
making or submitting such Company Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request,
and a summary of the material terms thereof, if the Company Acquisition
Proposal is not in writing, or a copy of the Company Acquisition Proposal and
any related draft agreements if it is in writing) that is made or submitted
by any Person during the Pre-Closing Period. The Company shall keep Parent
informed in all material respects on a prompt basis with respect to
the status of any such Company Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and
any material modification or proposed material modification thereto (and in

modification or proposed material modification thereto).   (c) Upon the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall immediately cease and shall
cause to be terminated any discussions existing as of the date of this
Agreement between the Company or any Representative of the Company and any

the Board of Directors of the Company may at any time prior to receipt of the
approval of the Company Stockholders of this Agreement, withhold, withdraw or
modify the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent in respect of
a Company Acquisition Transaction if: (i) an unsolicited, bona fide written

Transaction, and such offer is not withdrawn; (ii) the Company\'s Board of
Directors determines in good faith after consultation with its financial
advisors that such offer constitutes a Company Superior Offer;

withheld, withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent at any time
prior to four business days after Parent receives written notice from the

such offer is a Company Superior Offer; and (v) at the end of such four
business day period, after taking into account any adjustment or modification
of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent (and any adjustment or
modification of the terms of such Company Acquisition Proposal), the Board of
Directors of the Company again makes the determination in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel    53   and financial
advisors that such offer is a Company Superior Offer and that
the withholding, withdrawal or modification of the Company Recommendation
is required to comply with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of
the Company to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Delaware
law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Board
of Directors of the Company may at any time prior to receipt of the approval
of the Company\'s stockholders of this Agreement, withhold, withdraw or
modify the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent other than in
respect of a Company Acquisition Transaction if: (i) following consultation

good faith that the withdrawal or modification of such Company Recommendation
is required to comply with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of
Company to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Legal
Requirements; (ii) the Company Recommendation is not withdrawn or modified in
a manner adverse to Parent at any time prior to four business days after

Company\'s Board of Directors has determined to withdraw or modify the
Company Recommendation and specifying the reasons therefor, and (iii) at the
end of such four business day period, after taking into account any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent,
the Board of Directors of the Company again makes the determination in good
faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors that the withdrawal or modification of such Company Recommendation
is required to comply with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of
the Company to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Legal
Requirements. The Board of Directors of the Company may not withhold,
withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent
except in compliance in all respects with this Section 4.3(d).   (e)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) the
obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting and to hold the vote of the Company
Stockholders on the approval of the Merger and the approval and adoption of
this Agreement at the Company Stockholders\' Meeting shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement
or submission to it of any Company Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a
Company Superior Offer), or by any change of the Company Recommendation and
(ii) in any case in which the Company withholds or withdraws the Company
Recommendation pursuant to Section 4.3(d), the Company shall nevertheless
submit this Agreement and the Merger to a vote of the Company Stockholders as
permitted by Section 146 of the DGCL.  SECTION 5. ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF
THE PARTIES   5.1 REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND PROXY STATEMENT FOR

with the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting and complying with applicable Legal
Requirements (the "Parent Proxy Statement") and (iii) a prospectus relating
to the Parent Common Stock to be offered and sold pursuant to this Agreement
in the Merger (such registration statement, together with the amendments and

shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state
securities laws and other applicable Legal Requirements in connection with
the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, and each
party shall furnish all information concerning the Company, Parent and the
holders of capital stock of the Company and Parent, as applicable, as may be
reasonably requested by the other party in connection with any such action
and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Company Proxy Statement
and Parent Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or
correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to, the Registration
Statement or Parent Proxy Statement will be made by Parent, or with respect
to the Company Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, without providing
the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon.

jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Registration
Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC

Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC
for the amendment of the Registration Statement, the Parent Proxy Statement
or the Company Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information relating thereto. If at any
time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, is
discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to either the Registration Statement, the Company Proxy
Statement or the Parent Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC, after the other party or parties have had a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent required by
applicable Legal Requirements, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company or the stockholders of Parent, as the case may be.   (b) The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and their respective
officers, employees, consultants and advisors, including legal and accounting
advisors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to cooperate in connection with
the filing of the Registration Statement as may be reasonably requested. Such

with the preparation of the Registration Statement.   5.2 COMPANY

Company shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal
Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of
Company Common Stock to vote on a proposal to adopt this Agreement in
accordance with the Company Organization Documents and the DGCL (the "Company
Stockholders\' Meeting"). The Company Stockholders\' Meeting shall be held as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act. The Company and Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to hold the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting and the Parent\'s Stockholder Meeting on the same day. The Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary or
advisable to solicit proxies in favor of this Agreement and shall ensure that
all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders\' Meeting
are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. Once the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall
not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders\' Meeting (other than for
the absence of a quorum) without the consent of Parent.   (b) Subject to
Section 4.3(d), the Company Proxy Statement shall include the Company
Recommendation, and the Company Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or
modified in a manner adverse to Parent, and no resolution by the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify the
Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent shall be adopted or
proposed.    55    (c) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one
another (i) in connection with the preparation of the Company Proxy
Statement, the Parent Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement pursuant
to Section 5.1(b), (ii) in determining whether any action by or in respect

and seeking timely to complete or obtain any such actions, consents,

all applicable Legal Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting
of the holders of Parent Common Stock to vote on a proposal to approve the
issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement (the "Parent
Stockholders\' Meeting"). The Parent Stockholders\' Meeting shall be held as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take all actions necessary or advisable to solicit proxies in
favor of the issuance of Parent Common Stock and shall ensure that all
proxies solicited in connection with the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting are
solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. Once the
Parent Stockholders\' Meeting has been called and noticed, Parent shall not
postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting (other than for the
absence of a quorum) without the consent of the Company.   (e) The Parent
Proxy Statement shall include the Parent Recommendation, and the Parent
Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to the
Company, and no resolution by the Board of Directors of Parent or any
committee thereof to withdraw or modify the Parent Recommendation in a manner
adverse to the Company shall be adopted or proposed.   5.3 REGULATORY

event later than ten (10) business days after the date hereof, the Company

required to be filed with any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger

merger notification forms required by the merger notification or control laws
and regulations of any applicable foreign jurisdiction, as agreed to by the
parties). Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly (a) supply the other
with any information which may be required in order to effectuate such
filings and (b) supply any additional information which reasonably may be
required by a Governmental Body of any jurisdiction and which the parties may
reasonably deem appropriate.   (c) Each of the Company and Parent shall (i)
give the other party prompt notice of the commencement or threat of
commencement of any Legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with
respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii)    56   keep the other party informed as to the status
of any such Legal Proceeding or threat, and (iii) promptly inform the other
party of any communication to or from any Governmental Body regarding the
Merger.   5.4 COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS   (a) Effective as of the
Effective Time, the Company Stock Option Plans and each Company Option that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
exercisable or vested, shall be assumed by Parent. As of the Effective Time,
each Company Option shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of
Company Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into a right to
acquire cash and shares of Parent Common Stock in an amount, at an exercise
price and subject to such terms and conditions determined as provided below.
Subject to the accelerated vesting of Company Options as described in
Schedule 2.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, each Company Option so
assumed by Parent shall be subject to, and exercisable and vested upon,
substantially the same terms and conditions as under the applicable Company
Stock Option Plans, including the maximum term of the Company Option and the
provisions regarding termination of the Company Option following a
termination of employment, except that (i) each assumed Company Option shall
be exercisable for, and represent the right to acquire (A) that number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal
to (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (2) the Per
Share Stock Merger Consideration, plus (B) an amount of cash,
without interest, equal to (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (2) the Per Share Cash Merger Consideration, if any; and (ii)
the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock subject to each assumed
Company Option (and any associated cash consideration) shall be an amount
equal to (1) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time divided
by (2) the sum of the Per Share Stock Merger Consideration and the Stock
Equivalent Cash Consideration; and (iii) references under the Company Option
to a termination of employment shall mean, on and after the Effective Time, a
termination of employment with the Surviving Entity or any AngioDynamics
Corporation.   (b) The Company\'s Board of Directors, or its duly
appointed committee to administer the Company Stock Option Plans, shall adopt
resolutions and the Company and the Company\'s Board of Directors shall take
all such other actions as may be necessary or appropriate, effective
contingent upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
immediately prior to the Closing Date, to provide for the application of
Section 5.4(a) to the Company Stock Option Plans and the Company Options
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, including, without
limitation, obtaining all necessary consents.   (c) The conversion of
Company Options provided for in Section 5.4(a) shall be effected in a manner
consistent with Section 424 of the Code.   (d) As of the Effective Time,
Parent shall, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, assume all of
the Company Warrants identified on Schedule 2.3(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each Company
Warrant shall, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, be assumed by
Parent in such a manner that it shall be exercisable upon the same terms and
conditions as under each Company Warrant pursuant to which it was issued;
provided that (i) each Company Warrant so assumed shall be exercisable for,
and represent the right to acquire (A) that number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to (1) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (2) the Per Share Stock Merger
Consideration, plus (B) an amount of cash equal to (1) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant   
57   immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (2) the Per
Share Cash Merger Consideration, if any; and (ii) the exercise price per
share of Parent Common Stock subject to each assumed Company Warrant (and any
associated cash consideration) shall be an amount equal to (1) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (2) the sum of the
Per Share Stock Merger Consideration and the Stock Equivalent Cash
Consideration.   (e) As of the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all actions necessary or appropriate as required pursuant to the terms of
the Company ESPP so that each Purchase Period and Offering Period (each as
defined in the Company ESPP) then in progress under the ESPP shall terminate
no later than the Effective Time and each option thereunder shall be
automatically exercised on or prior thereto.   5.5 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS  
(a) Welfare Plans. Effective as of the Effective Time and for a transition
period ending on November 27, 2007 (the "Employee Transition Period"), or if
sooner, upon the applicable Acquired Corporations employee\'s termination of
employment, the Surviving Entity shall continue to provide welfare benefits
for the benefit of the employees of the Acquired Corporations that are no
less favorable in the aggregate to the benefits provided to such employees
under the Company Welfare Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
transition period may be longer than the period specified above to the extent
that the Parent, in its sole discretion, determines that a longer period is
necessary to effect a reasonable transition for such employees. Parent and/or
the Surviving Entity shall adopt transition rules to prevent any loss of
credit for participant contributions, payments or co-payments in a manner
consistent with Section 5.5(e) of this Agreement.   (b) 401(k) Plan. Unless
Parent has notified the Company no later than three days prior to the
Effective Time that the Company 401(k) Plan should not be terminated, the
Company will take all actions required to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan
so that the 401(k) Plan will be terminated no later than immediately before
the Effective Time. If the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Parent 401(k) Plan to be amended to permit the employees who were
eligible to participate in the Company 401(k) Plan immediately before the
Effective Time to be eligible to participate in the Parent 401(k) Plan as of
immediately following the Effective Time so that there will be no
interruption in the rights of such employees to make pre-tax contributions
under a Code Section 401(k) plan. All employees of the Acquired Corporations
who participate in the Company 401(k) Plan as of immediately before the
Effective Time shall be eligible for any matching contribution of Parent to
the same extent that similarly situated employees of Parent are entitled,
subject to the provisions of Section 5.5(e).   (c) Stock-Based Plans.
Following the Effective Time, employees of the Acquired Corporations will be
eligible to receive stock options and other stock-based awards under the
stock-based plans maintained by Parent and/or the Surviving Entity on
substantially the same basis as similarly situated Parent employees.   (d)
Employment Policies and Practices. During the Employee Transition Period,
Parent or the Surviving Entity will continue to maintain policies and
practices relating to vacation time and personal time off for non-exempt
employees that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those of the
Acquired Corporations that were applicable to the employees of the
Acquired Corporations immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Merger
shall not adversely affect any employee\'s accrual of, or right to take, any
accrued but unused personal vacation time to which such employee is entitled
pursuant to the personal or vacation policies applicable to such employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time.    58    (e) Service and
Vesting Credit. Parent and/or Surviving Entity will treat an individual\'s
employment as an employee by the Acquired Corporations the same as employment
as an employee by Parent and/or Surviving Entity for purposes of satisfying
vesting and eligibility to participate requirements under any Parent and/or
Surviving Entity benefit arrangement in which such employee participates
following the Effective Time, but in no event will such treatment result in a
duplication of benefits for any employee. In addition, Parent shall, to the
extent permitted by any benefit plan or underlying insurance or service
provider applicable to employees of the Acquired Corporations, use
commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any
limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the same
extent such limitations have been waived under any comparable Company
Employee Plan as of the Effective Time and, for the plan year that includes
the Effective Time, to recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-
of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-
pocket expenses paid by employees in the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs.   (f) No Future Commitment. Nothing in this Agreement shall
be construed to limit any rights of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Entity to (i) amend, modify or terminate any Company Employee Plans or any
other employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement or
(ii) terminate the employment of any employee of the any of the Acquired
Corporations at any time for any reason.   (g) Treatment of Certain
Options. Parent and the Surviving Entity agree and acknowledge and will take
all action necessary to provide that if the employment of any employee of an
Acquired Corporation is terminated by Parent or one of its affiliates for any
reason other than cause, as determined in good faith by Parent, on or prior
to the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date, each Company Option
outstanding as of the date thereof held by such terminating employee shall
become exercisable and vested with respect to 100% of the shares underlying
such Company Options and shall remain exercisable for a period of at least 90
days from the date the employment of such employee of an Acquired Corporation
is actually terminated (but in no event shall any Company Option remain
exercisable later than the expiration of its term).   5.6 INDEMNIFICATION OF
OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Entity to honor all rights to indemnification
existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of (i) current and former
directors, officers and employees of any Acquired Corporation (the
"Indemnified Persons") and (ii) those Persons who have indemnification
agreements with any Acquired Corporation as of the date of this Agreement,
for acts and omissions occurring prior to or at the Effective Time, as
provided in the Company Organizational Documents and under each
indemnification agreement with the Indemnified Persons to which any Acquired
Corporation is a party (as each is in effect as of the date of
this Agreement), for a period of six years from the Effective Time. The
Limited Liability Operating Agreement of the Surviving Entity will contain
provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least
as favorable to those contained in the Company Organizational Documents,
which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of Indemnified Persons, unless such
modification is required by applicable Legal Requirements.   (b) For a
period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Entity to provide for officers\' and directors\' liability insurance or a
"tail" policy for the benefit of each Person (other than the Company) named
as an insured party in any officers\' and directors\' liability insurance
policy held by an Acquired Corporation as of the date of this Agreement (the
"Insured Parties"), on terms with respect to such coverage no less favorable
than those of such policy in effect on    59   the date of this
Agreement, covering only those acts or omissions occurring prior to or at the
Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Entity may
substitute therefor policies issued by an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Company\'s current insurance carrier with at
least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that
are no less advantageous to the covered persons than the Company\'s existing
policies; provided, further that neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity
shall be required to maintain such policies to the extent the cost of
maintaining the same shall increase by more than 250% from the cost most
recently incurred by the Company for maintaining the same (the "Current DandO;
Insurance Cost"), in which case Parent or the Surviving Entity shall maintain
as much comparable insurance as can be obtained for such amount. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all reasonable actions requested by
Parent to maintain such directors and officers liability insurance. To
the extent that the Company can obtain, for an aggregate premium in an
amount acceptable to Parent, a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on terms and
conditions, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the Insured Parties, or
any other Person entitled to the benefit of Section 5.6(a) and Section 5.6(b)
of this Agreement, as applicable, than the existing officers\' and
directors\' liability insurance maintained by the Company, covering, without
limitation, the transactions contemplated hereby, then Parent and the
Surviving Entity shall satisfy their obligations under the preceding sentence
of this Section 5.6(b) by the Company (with the consent of Parent, the
granting or withholding of such consent not to be unreasonably delayed,
withheld or conditioned) purchasing such "tail" prepaid policy immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If such "tail" prepaid policy is obtained by the
Company prior to the Effective Time (with the consent of Parent), Parent
shall cause the Surviving Entity after the Effective Time to maintain such

three individuals who are Company directors as of the date hereof and are
designated by the Company prior to the date on which the Registration
Statement is declared effective by the SEC (which individuals shall be
reasonably acceptable to Parent\'s Nominating/Corporate Governance
Committee). In the event that any such individual is unwilling or unable to
serve as a director of Parent, the Company shall designate another individual
who is serving as a director of the Company as of the dater hereof and is
reasonably acceptable to the Board of Directors of Parent to serve as a
director of Parent. In the event that (i) any other individual designated to
serve on the Board of Directors of Parent immediately after the Effective

list. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each

as of such date) that would be payable pursuant to Section 1.5(a) hereof in
respect of all shares of Company Common Stock actually issued and outstanding
as of the date hereof (and all Company Options and Company Warrants
outstanding as of the date hereof) would not exceed the aggregate Merger

Parent and Merger Sub and may, subject to the terms of the Agreement, be
waived by Parent and Merger Sub, in whole or in part at any time and from
