the date of this Agreement by reason of any subdivisions, reclassifications,
splits, unit or share distributions, combinations or exchanges, then the
components of Merger Consideration will be correspondingly adjusted to
provide to the holders of such MGP Common Stock, EGP Common Stock and
Partnership Units, as applicable, with the same economic effect as

have been surrendered, as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Unit will be deemed at any time after the LP Merger

to such delivery and surrender and a payment date subsequent to such
compliance payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock (which
shall be paid by Parent) or Parent Opco Units (which shall be paid by Parent

III_ will thereafter look only to Parent or Parent Opco for the Merger
Consideration, payable in respect of such MGP Common Stock, EGP Common Stock
or Partnership Units, as the case may be, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Opco Units to which they are
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(e)_, or any distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.4(c)_, in each case, without any interest thereon. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of MGP Common Stock, EGP
Common Stock or Partnership Units immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental
entity under any escheat, abandoned property or similar Law will, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent or Parent
Opco, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. None of Parent, Parent Opco or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any former holder of MGP Common Stock, EGP Common Stock or
Partnership Units for any amount properly delivered to a governmental entity
under any escheat, abandoned property or similar Law.

 

(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a customary indemnity agreement or a bond, in such
amount as is customary and reasonably determined by Parent, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the LP Merger Consideration, payable in respect of
Partnership Units represented by such Certificate and any cash payable in
lieu of fractional Parent Common Stock or Parent Opco Units to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_.

 

(f) _Withholding_. Each of the Parent Entities and the Exchange Agent are
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement any amount or securities required to deduct and
withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts or securities are so deducted and withheld such
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid or issued to such Person in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made.

 

(g) _Issuance in Book-Entry Form_. At the option of Parent, Parent and/or
Parent Opco may issue some or all of the Parent Common Stock or Parent Opco
Units to be issued in the Mergers in book-entry form, without physical
certificates.

 



30

    

(h) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. Parent or Parent Opco will cause the
Exchange Agent to invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily
basis, in Parents sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
investment or loss thereon affects the amounts payable or the timing of the
amounts payable to the Partnership Unitholders pursuant to the other
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 3.4_. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments will be paid promptly to Parent or Parent
Opco. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be
made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit
into the Exchange Fund an amount of cash equal to such deficiency.

(i) _Tax Characterization of Merger and Cash Received_. It is intended that,
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (a) each of GP Merger 1 and GP Merger 2
shall be treated as a taxable sale by each of MGP and EGP of all of MGPs and
EGPs assets to Parent, as the regarded owner of Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub
2, in exchange for the GP Merger 1 Consideration and GP Merger 2
Consideration, respectively, and the assumption of all of MGPs and EGPs
liabilities (if any) followed by a distribution of such consideration to the
holders of equity in MGP and EGP in liquidation pursuant to Section 331 of
the Code, and that this Agreement be, and hereby is, adopted as a separate
plan of liquidation for each of MGP and EGP for U.S. federal income tax
purposes; and (b)(i) Parent Opco shall be treated as a continuation of
the Partnership, consistent with the principles of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.708-1(a), including with respect to the receipt of Parent Opco Units
by holders of Partnership Units; (ii) each Partnership Unit that is converted
into the Regular Consideration shall be treated as a taxable sale by the
holders of such Partnership Units to Parent in accordance with Section 741 of
the Code; and (iii) Parent shall be treated as contributing all of its assets
(other than the interests in the Partnership it acquired directly from holders
of Partnership Units in the taxable exchange described in _clause (ii)_
above) and certain of its liabilities to the Partnership in a transaction
described in Section 721 of the Code. Each of the Parties agrees to prepare
and file all U.S. federal income Tax Returns in accordance with the foregoing
and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith on any such
Tax Return, or in the course of any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to U.S. federal income Taxes, except as otherwise required by
applicable Laws following a final determination by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other final administrative decision by an applicable
Governmental Authority.

3.5 _Employee Partnership Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Partnership Units_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.13_ of the Partnership
Disclosure Letter, each restricted Partnership Unit granted under the
Partnerships equity compensation plans (each such unit, a " _Partnership_
___Restricted Unit_ " and such plans, the " _Partnership Equity Plans_ ") that
is outstanding immediately prior to the LP Merger Effective Time shall, at
the LP Merger Effective Time, be converted into restricted shares of Parent
Common Stock (a " _Parent Award_ "), on substantially the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the applicable Partnership Restricted Unit
(including vesting terms) prior to the LP Merger Effective Time, except that
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Parent Award
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) shall be equal to the number of
Partnership Units subject to the applicable Partnership Restricted Unit award
immediately prior to the LP Merger Effective Time _multiplied by_ the All
Equity Exchange Ratio.

 



31

    

(b) _Assumption of Certain Partnership Equity Awards by Parent_. At the LP
Merger Effective Time, Parent shall assume all the obligations of Partnership
under the Partnership Equity Plans, and the number and kind of units available
for issuance under each Partnership Equity Plan shall be adjusted to reflect
shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall take all corporate actions that
are necessary for the assumption of the obligations of Partnership under the
Partnership Equity Plans pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the LP Merger Effective Time, if and to the
extent necessary to cause a sufficient number of Parent Common Stock to be
registered and issuable with respect to Parent Awards, Parent shall register
on the appropriate registration statement such number of shares of Parent
Common Stock as may be issuable pursuant to the Parent Awards.

(c) _Corporate Approvals_. The Partnership shall take all actions necessary
to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_,
including, without limitation, having the applicable board or committee
administering the applicable Partnership Equity Plan governing the affected
awards adopt such resolutions as are necessary to effect the foregoing
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_.

approvals contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ and _Article_ __ _ VIII_ are
duly obtained, assuming the consents, waivers and approvals specified in
_Section_ __ _ 7.9(a)_ are obtained and except as set forth in _Section_ __
_ 5.5 _of the Partnership Disclosure Letter, the execution, delivery and

default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become
a default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of termination or
cancellation of, or accelerate the performance required by, any note, bond,

5.7 _Financial Reports and the Partnership SEC Documents_.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2018, the Partnership has filed with or furnished to the
SEC all forms, registration statements, reports, schedules and statements
required to be filed or furnished by it under the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act. At the time filed (or, in the case of registration statements,
solely on the dates of effectiveness) (except to the extent amended by a
subsequently filed Partnership SEC Document prior to the date of this
Agreement, in which case as of the date of such amendment), each Partnership
SEC Document complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, as the case may be and, did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact, or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) Any consolidated financial statements of the Partnership included in the
Partnership SEC Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the
date of the last such amendment) (A) complied as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (B) were prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be expressly indicated in the notes thereto, to the
extent permitted by applicable SEC regulations and subject, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end adjustments and the absence
of footnote disclosure), and (C) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Partnership and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case
of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end adjustments which are
not individually or in the aggregate material).

 

(c) None of the Partnership Entities or any of its consolidated Subsidiaries
is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture,
off-balance sheet partnership or any similar contract (including any contract
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among any Partnership
Entity and any of its consolidated Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the
SEC)), where the purpose of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Partnership
in the Partnerships published financial statements or any Partnership SEC
Documents

5.8 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Partnership has established and
maintains internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls
and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under
the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that material information relating to the Partnership, including its
Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
the Partnerships principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. The
Partnerships principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
have

 



41

    

 disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the Partnerships
auditors and the audit committee of the Partnership Board (x) all significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could
adversely affect the Partnerships ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and have identified for the Partnerships auditors any
material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Partnerships internal controls. The principal executive officer
and the principal financial officer of the Partnership have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any
related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the
Partnership SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications were complete and correct as of the dates they were made.

Documents filed by the Partnership prior to the date of this Agreement,
neither the Partnership nor any of its consolidated Subsidiaries had at the
Balance Sheet Date or has incurred since that date, any liabilities or
obligations (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of any
nature, except (i) liabilities, obligations or contingencies that (A) are
accrued or reserved against in the financial statements of the Partnership
included in the Partnership SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this
Agreement, or reflected in the notes thereto, (B) were incurred since the
Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practices, (C) were incurred in accordance with this Agreement or (D) were
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions or (ii) liabilities, obligations or contingencies that (A) would
not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Partnership Material Adverse Effect or (B) that have been
discharged or paid in full prior to the date of this Agreement.

(b) Except for liabilities or obligations incurred pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions or for fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions (all of which fees and expenses will be paid and satisfied in
full prior to or substantially concurrent with the Closing), and except for
MGPs and EGPs obligations under applicable Law or the Existing Partnership
Agreement as general partners of the Partnership, there are (i) no
liabilities or obligations of EGP or MGP (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise) of any nature that are or would reasonably be
expected to exceed $250,000 in the aggregate; and (ii) no liabilities or
obligations of EGP or MGP (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise)
of any nature that are or would reasonably be expected to be in excess of the
sum of the GP Merger 1 Consideration and the GP Merger 2 Consideration.

 

5.10 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any change, event,
development, circumstance, condition, occurrence or effect that has had or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 



42

    

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date and through the date of this Agreement,
except for this Agreement and the Transactions and the discussions,
negotiations and transactions related thereto or related to any similar
transaction involving the merger or acquisition of a Partnership Entity or a
material portion of its assets, each Partnership Entity has carried on and
operated its businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course of
business and no Partnership Entity or any of its Subsidiaries has undertaken
any action that would be prohibited by _Sections 4.1(d)_ ,  _(e)_ , _(j)_ or
_(l)_ or, as it relates to the foregoing clauses, _(r)_.

5.11 _Compliance with Applicable Law; Permits_.

(a) Each of the Partnership Entities is in compliance with, and is not in
default under or in violation of, any applicable Law, other than any
noncompliance, default or violation which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to be material to the Partnership Entities
and their respective Subsidiaries (taken as a whole). As of the date of this
Agreement, none of the Partnership Entities has received any written
communication since the Balance Sheet Date from a Governmental Authority that
alleges that any Partnership Entity or any of its Subsidiaries is not in
compliance in all material respects with or is in default or violation of in
any material respect any applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made in this _Section_ __ _
5.11(a)_ with respect to Environmental Laws or applicable Laws relating to
employee benefit matters, employment or labor matters or Tax matters.

(b) Except for the Environmental Permits (which are addressed in _Section_ __
_ 5.13_), each Partnership Entity and each of its Subsidiaries is in
possession of all franchises, tariffs, grants, authorizations, licenses,
permits, easements, variances, exemptions, consents, certificates, approvals
and orders of any Governmental Authority necessary under applicable Law to
own, lease and operate their properties and to lawfully carry on their
businesses as they are being conducted as of the date of this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Partnership Permits_ "), except where the failure to be
in possession of such Partnership Permits would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to be material to the Partnership Entities
and their respective Subsidiaries (taken as a whole). All Partnership Permits
are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and
effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to
be material to the Partnership Entities and their respective Subsidiaries
(taken as a whole). No suspension or cancellation of any of the material
Partnership Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Partnership, threatened. To the Knowledge of the Partnership, no event or
condition has occurred or exists which would result in a violation of, breach,
default or loss of a benefit under, or acceleration of an obligation of any
Partnership Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries under, any
material Partnership Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an applicable
Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew, extend, any material
Partnership Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or
both).

general principles of equity, and except for Partnership Material Agreements
that, after the date of this Agreement, have expired in accordance with their
terms or have been terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 4.1_ of this

its initial taxable year through and including its taxable year ended
December 31 immediately prior to the Closing, has elected and has been subject
to U.S. federal taxation as a REIT and has satisfied all requirements to
qualify as a REIT, and has so qualified, for U.S. federal Tax purposes, (ii)
at all times since such date, has operated in such a manner so as to qualify

such applicable Law relating to wages, hours, collective bargaining,
discrimination, civil rights, safety and health and workers compensation,

52

    

5.21 _Insurance_. The Partnership and its Subsidiaries maintain, or are
entitled to the benefits of, insurance in such amounts and against such risks
substantially as the Partnership believes to be customary for the industries

Adverse Effect, (i) all material insurance policies maintained by or on behalf
of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement
are in full force and effect, and all premiums due on such policies have been
paid by the Partnership or its Subsidiaries and (ii) the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms and provisions of all insurance
policies maintained by or on behalf of the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, and neither the Partnership nor

that would permit termination or material modification of, any material
insurance policies.

5.22 _State Takeover Statutes_. The Partnership Board has taken all action
necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Support Agreements

Partnership Disclosure Letter, there is no broker, finder, investment banker
or financial advisor that has been retained by or is authorized to act on
behalf of the Partnership Entities or any of their Subsidiaries who might be
entitled to any fee or commission from the Partnership Entities or any of
their Affiliates in connection with the Transactions. Set forth on Section

Partnership, as of the date of this Agreement, subject to the assumptions and
qualifications set forth therein, of all financial, legal, accounting or other
advisory fees and expenses incurred but not paid, or expected to be incurred,
by the Partnership Entities or their Subsidiaries in connection with this

and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered, and qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the

the consummation of the Transactions by the Parent Entities do not and will
not (i) constitute a breach or violation of, or result in a default (or an
event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a
default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of termination or
cancellation of, or accelerate the performance required by, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, lease, contract,
agreement, joint venture or other instrument or obligation to which such
Parent Entity or any of its respective Subsidiaries is a party or by which
such Parent Entity or any of its Subsidiaries or properties is subject or
bound except for such breaches, violations, defaults, terminations,
cancellations or accelerations which, either individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
(ii) constitute a breach or violation of, or a default under any organization
document of the Parent Entities or their respective Subsidiaries (including
the Parent Charter and the limited liability company agreement of Parent
Opco), (iii) materially contravene or conflict with or constitute a
material violation of any provision of any Law binding upon or applicable to
the Parent Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries or (iv) result in
the creation of any material Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on any of the
assets of the Parent Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries
assets.

6.7 _Consents and Approvals_. No consents or approvals of, or filings or
registrations with, any Governmental Authority are necessary in connection
with (i) the execution and delivery by the Parent Entities of this Agreement
or (ii) the consummation by the Parent Entities of the Transactions,
except for (A) the filing with the SEC of the registration statement on Form
S-4 by Parent and Parent Opco covering the issuance of shares of Parent Common
Stock and Parent Opco Units in connection with the Mergers (including Parent

Statement_ ") and other filings under federal and state securities Laws, (B)
the filing of the Certificates of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, (C) any consents, authorizations, approvals, filings or

Antitrust Laws, and (E) such other consents, authorizations, approvals,
filings or registrations the absence or unavailability of which would not,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

6.8 _Financial Reports and Parent SEC Documents_.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2018, Parent has filed with and furnished to the SEC all
forms, registration statements, reports, schedules and statements required to
be filed or furnished under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. At the
time filed (or, in the case of registration statements, solely on the dates of
effectiveness) (except to the extent amended by a subsequently filed Parent
SEC Document prior to the date of this Agreement, in which case as of the date
of such amendment), each Parent SEC Document complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact, or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



59

    

(b) Any consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents (the " _Parent Financial Statements_ ") as of their respective
dates (if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment) (A) complied as
to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (B)
were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be expressly indicated in the notes thereto,
to the extent permitted by applicable SEC regulations and subject, in the
case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end adjustments and the
absence of footnote disclosure), and (C) fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end adjustments which are not,
individually or in the aggregate, material).

 

(c) Neither Parent nor any of its consolidated Subsidiaries is a party to, or
has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of its
consolidated Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand), or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the purpose of
such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, Parent in Parents published financial statements or
any Parent SEC Documents.

6.9 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Parent has established and maintains
internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and
procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure
that material information relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Parents principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure, and such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in SEC rules and forms. Parents principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent
evaluation, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board
(x) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls which could adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for Parents auditors
any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parents internal controls. The principal executive officer and the
principal financial officer of Parent have made all certifications required by
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC with respect to the Parent SEC Documents, and the
statements contained in such certifications were complete and correct as of
the dates they were made.

 



60

    

6.10 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as disclosed in the
audited financial statements (or notes thereto) included in Parents Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, the unaudited
financial statements (or notes thereto) included in Parents Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2019, and in the
financial statements (or notes thereto) included in subsequent Parent SEC
Documents filed by Parent prior to the date of this Agreement, neither Parent
nor any of its consolidated subsidiaries had at September 30, 2019 or has
incurred since that date, any liabilities or obligations (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise) of any nature, except (i) liabilities,
obligations or contingencies that (A) are accrued or reserved against in the
financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents filed
prior to the date of this Agreement, or reflected in the notes thereto, (B)
were incurred since September 30, 2019 and prior to the date of this Agreement
in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice or (C)
were incurred in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) liabilities,
obligations or contingencies that (A) would not reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect or (B) have been discharged or paid in full prior to the date of this
Agreement.

6.11 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any change, event,
development, circumstance, condition, contribution, occurrence or effect,
with respect to the Parent Entities and their Subsidiaries, that has had, or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement, except
for this Agreement and the Transactions and the discussions, negotiations and
transactions related thereto, each of the Parent Entities and their
Subsidiaries have carried on and operated its businesses in all material
respects in the ordinary course of business.

 

6.12 _Compliance with Applicable Law; Permits_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all, and is not
in default under or in violation of any, applicable Law, other than any
noncompliance, default or violation which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
communication since the Balance Sheet Date and prior to the date of this
Agreement from a Governmental Authority that alleges that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is not in compliance with or is in default or violation of any
applicable Law, except where such non-compliance, default or violation would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises, tariffs,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exemptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority
necessary under applicable Law to own, lease and operate their properties and
to lawfully carry on their businesses as they are being conducted as of the
date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Parent Permits_ "), except where
the failure to be in possession of such Parent Permits would not, individually
or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. All Parent Permits are in full force and effect, except where the
failure to be in full force and effect would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any of the Parent Permits is pending or
threatened, except where such suspension or cancellation would not
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



61

    

6.13 _Litigation_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is otherwise a party or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, a threatened party, except for Proceedings that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to be material to
Parent and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or delay the consummation of
the Merger(s) beyond the Outside Date.

 

6.14 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied (or to be
supplied) in writing by or on behalf of the Parent Entities specifically for
inclusion in (i) the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration
Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, is filed with the SEC or at
the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading or (ii)
the Partnership Proxy Statement (which will be included as a prospectus in
the Registration Statement) will, on the date the Partnership Proxy Statement
is first mailed to Partnership Unitholders, and at the time of the Partnership
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Registration Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Entities make no representation or
warranty with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of any
Partnership Entity for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any of the
foregoing documents.

liability for fees of any broker, finder or financial advisor in respect of
the Transactions for which the Partnership Entities will have any
responsibility or liability whatsoever.

 

6.16 _Operations of Merger Subsidiaries_. Parent is directly or indirectly the
sole holder of all limited liability company interests in each Merger

of the Parent Entities.

6.18 _No Other Representations and Warranties_.

 

(a) The Partnership Entities acknowledge and agree that except for the
representations and warranties of the Parent Entities set forth in this 
_Article_ __ _ VI_ and the representations and warranties of such Persons set
forth in the Support Agreements, (i) none of the Parent Entities, their
respective Affiliates or Representatives nor any other Person makes or has

generality of the foregoing clause (i), but subject to the representations,
warranties and covenants of such Persons set forth in this Agreement and the
Support Agreements, none of the Parent Entities, their respective Affiliates
or Representatives nor any other Person will have or be subject to any
liability or other obligation to the Partnership Entities or any other Person
resulting from the distribution to the Partnership Entities, their Affiliates
or any of their respective Representatives (in any form whatsoever and through

documents, estimates, projections, sample calculations, forecasts or other
forward-looking information, business plans or other material developed by or

person, by phone, through video or in any other format), in expectation of
the Transactions.

(b) Each of the Partnership Entities acknowledges and agrees that (i) in
connection with the due diligence investigation by the Partnership Entities,
the Partnership Entities have received certain estimates, projections,

Agreement and any rights hereunder with respect thereto.

(c) Without amending, limiting or otherwise modifying the representations and
warranties of the Parent Entities set forth in _Article VI_ of this Agreement
or the representations and warranties of such Persons set forth in the Support
Agreements, each of the Partnership Entities acknowledges and agrees that it

(c) Each of the Parties will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate
in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission

a private Person, (ii) promptly inform the Other Parties of (and supply to the
Other Parties) any communication received by such Party from, or given by such

communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
Person, in each case regarding the Transactions, (iii) permit the Other

comments in any communication to be given by it to any Governmental Authority
with respect to obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in
connection with the Transactions and (iv) consult with the Other Parties in
advance of any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Authority or,
in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, with any other Person,
and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Authority or other
Person, give the Other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meetings and teleconferences. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)_,
the Parties will take reasonable efforts to share information protected from
disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint
defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1_
in a manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege.

7.2 _Registration Statement_ _; Partnership Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement (but no later
than 20 Business Days after the date of this Agreement unless otherwise
mutually agreed by the Partnership and Parent), (i) the Partnership will
prepare in preliminary form and file with the SEC the Partnership Proxy
Statement and (ii) Parent and Parent Opco will prepare and file with the SEC
the Registration Statement. The Partnership, Parent and Parent Opco will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing and keep the Registration Statement effective for so long as
necessary to consummate the Transactions. The Partnership will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Partnership Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the Partnership Unitholders as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement will be
made by Parent or Parent Opco, and no filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Partnership Proxy Statement will be made by the
Partnership without providing the Other Parties a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon (other than, in each case, any filing, amendment or
supplement made in connection with a Partnership Change in Recommendation).
If at any time prior to the LP Merger Effective Time any information relating
to the Partnership, Parent or Parent Opco, or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by the Partnership, Parent
or Parent Opco that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
either the Registration Statement or the Partnership Proxy Statement, so that
any such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,

 



65

    

 the Party that discovers such information will promptly notify the Other
Parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
will be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the Partnership Unitholders. The Parties will notify each
other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the
SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Registration Statement or the Partnership Proxy Statement
or for additional information and will supply each other with copies of (i)
all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to
the Registration Statement, the Partnership Proxy Statement or the
Transactions and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating to the Registration
Statement.

 

(b) The Partnership will, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date
of this Agreement, in accordance with applicable Law, the Existing
Partnership Agreement and the rules of the NASDAQ, establish a record date
for, and as soon as reasonably practicable following the Registration
Statement being declared effective by the SEC, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold, the Partnership Meeting. The Partnership Proxy Statement
shall (subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.3)_ include the Partnership Board
Recommendation. The Partnerships obligations to call, give notice of and hold
the Partnership Meeting in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ shall
not be limited or otherwise affected by the making, commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission of any Superior Proposal or Alternative Proposal,
or by any Partnership Change in Recommendation. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Partnership agrees that: (i) unless this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms, the Partnership
shall not submit any Superior Proposal to a vote of the Partnership
Unitholders; and (ii) the Partnership shall not (without Parents prior
written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
adjourn, postpone or cancel (or propose, publicly or otherwise, or resolve
to, to adjourn, postpone or cancel) the Partnership Meeting. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Partnership may postpone or
adjourn the Partnership Meeting (i) in the absence of proxies sufficient to
obtain the Partnership Unitholder Approval, to solicit additional proxies for
the purpose of obtaining Partnership Unitholder Approval, (ii) in the absence
of a quorum, (iii) to the extent required by a court of competent jurisdiction
in connection with any Proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions and (iv) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing
and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Partnership
has determined after consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary
under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Partnership Unitholders prior to the
Partnership Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if there occurs a Partnership Change in Recommendation, the
Partnership shall remain required to call, hold and convene the Partnership
Meeting unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms. 

7.3 _Alternative Proposals; Change in Recommendation by the Partnership_.

 

(a) Each Partnership Entity will, and will cause each of the Partnerships
Subsidiaries to, and will instruct and use reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their respective directors, officers, employees and other
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to an Alternative Proposal, and promptly (but in any event no later than 48
hours after the date of this Agreement) request the return or destruction of
all confidential information previously provided

 



66

    

 to such Persons by or on behalf of each such Partnership Entity or the
Partnerships Subsidiaries. Except as permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_,
each Partnership Entity will not, and will cause the Partnerships
Subsidiaries not to, and will instruct and use reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their respective directors, officers, employees and other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the submission of any Alternative
Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected
to lead to an Alternative Proposal, or (ii) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public
information with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Alternative Proposal. 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _
7.3_, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, (i) the Partnership has
received an unsolicited written Alternative Proposal that the Partnership
Board or the Special Committee believes is _bona fide_ , and that did not
result from a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ and (ii) the Partnership
Board (acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special
Committee, after consultation with Centerview Partners, or such other
financial advisor as may be selected by the Special Committee (the "
_Financial Advisor_ ") and outside legal counsel, determines in good faith
that such Alternative Proposal could reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, then the Partnership may, subject to _clauses_ __ _ (x)_
and _(y)_ below, (A) furnish information, including confidential information,
with respect to the Partnership Entities and their respective Affiliates and
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Alternative Proposal and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such Alternative
Proposal; _provided_ that (x) (I) the Partnership gives Parent written notice
of the identity of such Person and the Partnerships decision to furnish non-
public information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person within 24 hours following the decision to do so and (II) the
Partnership receives from such Person, and delivers to Parent a copy of, an
executed confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality provisions no
less favorable in the aggregate to the Partnership than the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the execution
of this Agreement ( _provided_ that such confidentiality agreement need not
include explicit or implicit standstill provisions or otherwise restrict the
making of, or amendment or modification to, an Alternative Proposal), and (y)
the Partnership will provide to Parent any non-public information about the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries that was not previously provided or made
available to Parent prior to or concurrently with providing or making
available such non-public information to such other Person.

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Partnership set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_, the Partnership will promptly (and in no event later
than 24 hours after receipt) (i) advise Parent in writing of any Alternative
Proposal (and any material changes thereto in accordance with the following
sentence) and the material terms and conditions of any such Alternative
Proposal, including the identity of such Person making such Alternative
Proposal, and (ii) provide Parent with copies of the latest drafts of the
proposed transaction agreement and all ancillary agreements related thereto
received by the Partnership Entities or any of their respective
Representatives setting forth the terms and conditions of such Alternative
Proposal and any other documents or communications containing any material
terms or conditions of such Alternative Proposal. The Partnership Entities
will promptly keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material terms
and conditions of such Alternative Proposal and any modification or proposed
modification thereto, and shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours
after transmittal or receipt), provide

 



67

    

 Parent with copies of any changes to the material terms of such Alternative
Proposal and, if the changes are not made in writing, a written summary of
such changes to the material terms of such Alternative Proposal. The
Partnership Entities agree that neither the Partnership Entities nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries has entered into or will enter into any
agreement with any Person which prohibits the Partnership Entities
from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this _Section_ __
_ 7.3_.

qualify in any manner adverse to Parent the Partnership Board Recommendation,

Proxy Statement, (C) fail to reaffirm (publicly, if so requested by Parent)
the Partnership Board Recommendation within five Business Days after the date
of any Alternative Proposal (or material modification thereto) is publicly
disclosed by the Partnership or the Person making such Alternative Proposal or
(D) publicly approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, any Alternative Proposal (any action described in this _Section_
__ _ 7.3(d)(i)_ being referred to as a " _Partnership Change in
Recommendation_ "); (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Partnership Entities or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement, or other similar contract or any tender or exchange offer providing
for, with respect to, or in connection with, any Alternative Proposal; or
(iii) fail to announce publicly within ten Business Days after a tender
offer or exchange offer relating to the Partnership Units shall have been
commenced that the Partnership Board recommends rejection of such tender offer
or exchange offer and reaffirming the Partnership Board Recommendation; or
(iv) resolve, agree or publicly propose to, or authorize the Partnership
Entities or any Representative of the Partnership Entities to agree or
publicly propose to take any of the actions referred to in this _Section_ __ _
7.3(d)_. For the avoidance of doubt, a public statement that describes the
Partnerships receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed a Partnership Change in
Recommendation.

 

(e) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if (i)
the Partnership receives a written, unsolicited Alternative Proposal (and
such proposal is not withdrawn) that the Partnership Board or the Special
Committee believes is _bona fide_ , (ii) such Alternative Proposal did not
result directly or indirectly from a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_,
(iii) the Partnership Board (acting on the recommendation of the Special
Committee) or the Special Committee determines, after consultation with the
Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Alternative Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (iv) the Partnership Board (acting on the
recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee determines
in good faith that, after consulting with outside legal counsel, the failure
to effect a Partnership Change in Recommendation would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Delaware Law and the Existing
Partnership Agreement, then the Partnership Board may at any time prior
to obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, effect a Partnership Change
in Recommendation; _provided, however_ , that the Partnership Board may not
take such action pursuant to the foregoing unless:

 



68

    

(i) the Partnership has provided prior written notice to Parent specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons for such action (including delivering to Parent
a copy of the proposed definitive agreement providing for the Alternative
Proposal for such Superior Proposal in the form to be entered into and any
other relevant proposed transaction agreements, at least three Business Days
in advance of its intention to take such action with respect to a Partnership
Change in Recommendation, unless at the time such notice is otherwise required
to be given there are less than three Business Days prior to the Partnership
Meeting, in which case the Partnership will provide as much notice as is
reasonably practicable (the period inclusive of all such days, the " _Notice
Period_ ") (it being understood and agreed that any material amendment to the
terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a new notice pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)(i)_ and a new Notice Period, but such Notice Period
shall only consist of two Business Days (instead of three Business Days) from
the date of such notice, unless this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)(i)_ would
otherwise provide for a shorter Notice Period); and

 

(ii) during the Notice Period the Partnership has negotiated with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the reasonable determination of the
Partnership Board (acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee) or
the Special Committee, after consultation with the Financial Advisor and
outside legal counsel) a Superior Proposal.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Partnership Board is permitted, at any time prior to obtaining the Partnership
Unitholder Approval, other than in connection with an Alternative Proposal, to
effect a Partnership Change in Recommendation in response to an Intervening
Event but only if (i) prior to taking any such action, the Partnership Board
(acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special
Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with and considering
the advice of outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Delaware
Law and the Existing Partnership Agreement, (ii) the Partnership has given at
least three Business Days advance written notice to Parent that the
Partnership Board intends to take such action (which notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the reasons for such action) and (iii) during such period
the Partnership has negotiated, and has used reasonable best efforts to cause
the Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel to negotiate, with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so as to permit the
Partnership Board (acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee) or
Special Committee (in its judgment, after consultation with the Financial
Advisor and outside legal counsel) not to make the determination described in
_clause (a)_. If after compliance with the foregoing _clauses (i)_ through
_(iii)_ the Partnership Board (acting on the recommendation of the Special
Committee) or the Special Committee determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to effect a Partnership Change in Recommendation would reasonably be
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Delaware
Law and the Existing Partnership Agreement, then the Partnership Board may, at
any time prior to obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, effect a
Partnership Change in Recommendation. An " _Intervening Event_ " means a
material event, circumstance, state of facts, occurrence, development or
change that did not exist or was not known to the Partnership Board on the
date of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which were not
known or the magnitude of which was not known to the Partnership Board as of
the date of this Agreement), which event, circumstance, state of facts,

 



69

    

 occurrence, development or change, or any material consequences thereof,
becomes known to the Partnership Board prior to the receipt of the Partnership
Unitholder Approval; _provided, however_ , that (A) in no event shall the
receipt, existence, potential for or terms of an Alternative Proposal or any
matter relating thereto or consequence thereof constitute an Intervening Event
and (B) no change, event, development, circumstance, condition, occurrence or
effect relating to Parent or its Subsidiaries shall be taken into account in
determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred if such change, event,
development, circumstance, condition, occurrence or effect would be excluded
for purposes of determining whether a Material Adverse Effect on Parent has
occurred pursuant to clauses (a) through (j) of the definition of Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent the Partnership or the
Partnership Board from taking and disclosing to the Partnership Unitholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Partnership Unitholders)
or from making any legally required disclosure to Partnership Unitholders.
Any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by the Partnership or the Partnership
Board to the Partnership Unitholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Partnership
Unitholders) will not be considered a failure to make, or a
withdrawal, modification or change in any manner adverse to Parent of, all or
a portion of the Partnership Board Recommendation.

(h) The Partnership Entities agree that they will not release or permit the
release of any Person from, or amend, waive or permit the amendment or waiver
of any provision of, any "standstill" or similar agreement or provision then
in effect to which the Partnership Entities is or becomes a party or under
which the Partnership Entities have any rights, and will use its reasonable
best efforts to enforce, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, each
such agreement or provision at the request of Parent; _provided_ , that the
Partnership Entities shall be permitted to waive any "standstill" or similar
agreement or provision to the extent necessary to permit a Person to make an
Alternative Proposal to the Partnership Board or the Special Committee in a
confidential manner if the Partnership Board (acting on the recommendation of
the Special Committee) or the Special Committee determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, that
the failure to so waive would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
duties under applicable Delaware Law and the Existing Partnership Agreement.

 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from any Person or
"group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than Parent
and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition
(whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions), of 25%
or more of the consolidated assets of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole (in the case of assets owned by the Fund Entities, taking
into account only the Partnerships proportionate share of such assets) or to
which 25% or more of the consolidated revenues or earnings of the Partnership
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are attributable, (B) direct or
indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act) of 25% or more of the outstanding Partnership Units, (C)
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated

 



70

    

 would result in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of the outstanding
Partnership Units, or (D) merger, consolidation, unit exchange, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction which is structured to permit such Person or group to
acquire beneficial ownership of at least 25% of the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries consolidated assets or at least 25% of the outstanding
Partnership Units; in each case, other than the Transactions.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any written Alternative Proposal which the
Partnership Board (acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee) or
the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, to be more favorable from a
financial point of view to the Partnership Unitholders than the Transactions,
taking into account at the time of determination (A) all considerations, (B)
the identity of the Person making such offer, (C) the anticipated timing,
conditions and prospects for completion of the transactions contemplated by
such offer, (D) the other terms and conditions of such offer and the
implications thereof on the Partnership, including relevant legal, regulatory
and other aspects of such offer and (E) any changes to the terms of
this Agreement that as of that time had been committed to by Parent in
writing; _provided_ , that for purposes of the definition of "Superior
Proposal", the references to "25%" in the definition of Alternative Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

7.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, the Partnership
Entities shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, for the
purpose of facilitating the (x) consummation of the Transactions or
integration planning relating thereto and (y) the transition of the businesses
of the Partnership Entities to the Parent Entities as of the Closing, afford
the other party and its Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to (and, with respect to books and records, the right to copy)
all of its and its Subsidiaries properties, commitments, books, contracts,
records and correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic
form), officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives; _provided_ , such access shall not include any environmental
sampling or testing. The Partnership Entities shall furnish reasonably
promptly to Parent all information concerning their and their respective
Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request for the purposes described in clauses (x) and (y) of this _Section_
__ _ 7.4(a)_. Parent and its Representatives shall hold information received
from the Partnership Entities pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ in
confidence in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) This _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ shall not require the Partnership Entities
to permit any access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable,
good faith judgment of such party, would reasonably be expected to result in
(i) any violation of any contract to which such party or its Subsidiaries is a
party or any applicable Law (including Antitrust Laws or privacy laws) or
(ii) if such party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the other
party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a
litigation, such information being reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_
that, in the case of _clause_ __ _ (i)_, the parties shall cooperate in
seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information to the extent
doing so would not (in

 



71

    

 the good faith belief of the party being requested to disclose the
information (after consultation with counsel) reasonably be expected to result
in the violation of any such contract or Law or could reasonably (in the good
faith belief of the party being requested to disclose the information (after
consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed through
the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which non-employee
Representatives of Parent or its Subsidiaries shall be provided access to such
information; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the party being requested to
disclose the information shall (x) notify Parent that such disclosures would
reasonably be expected to violate its or its Subsidiaries obligations under
any such contract or Law and (y) communicate to Parent in reasonable detail
the facts giving rise to such notification and the subject matter of such
information (to the extent it is able to do so in accordance with the first
proviso in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)_) and (z) in the case where such
disclosures would be reasonably expected to violate its or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any contract, use reasonable commercial efforts to seek
consent from the applicable third party to any such contract with respect to
the disclosures prohibited thereby. In addition, this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_
shall not require the Partnership Entities to permit any access, or disclose
any information, to the extent such information relates to the applicable
portions of the minutes of meetings of the Partnership Board or Special
Committee, or any presentations or other materials prepared by or for the
Partnership Board or Special Committee, to the extent relating to (I) the
Transactions or any similar transaction involving the merger or acquisition of
a Partnership Entity or a material portion of its assets, (II) any Alternative
Proposal or (III) any Intervening Event.

 

7.5 _Public Statements_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably
agreed upon by Parent and the Partnership. The Parent Entities and the
Partnership Entities will not, and each of the foregoing will cause its
Representatives not to, issue any public announcements or make other public
disclosures regarding this Agreement or the Transactions, without the prior
written approval of the Partnership or Parent, respectively; _provided,
however_ , that a Party or its Representatives may issue a public announcement
or other public disclosures required by Law or the rules of any stock
exchange upon which such Partys or its Parent entitys capital stock is
traded, provided such Party uses reasonable best efforts to afford the Other
Party an opportunity to first review the content of the proposed disclosure
and provide reasonable comment regarding same.

7.6 _Confidentiality_. The obligations of Parent and the Partnership under
the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms and all non-public information provided to any Party
or its Representatives pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is
deemed to be "Confidential Information" as defined under the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that nothing in the Confidentiality Agreement
shall be deemed to restrict the performance by the Partnership Entities or
the Parent Entities of their respective obligations under this Agreement, and
in the case of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement the terms of this Agreement shall control.

7.7 _Takeover Laws_. Neither the Partnership Entities nor Parent Entities will
take any action that would cause the Transactions to be subject to
requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, and each of them will take all
reasonable steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the Transactions from the Takeover Laws of any state that
purport to apply to this Agreement or the Transactions. If the restrictions of
any Takeover Law become

 



72

    

 applicable to any of the Transactions, the Partnership Entities and the
Parent Entities shall take all action necessary to ensure that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise lawfully minimize the
effect of such Takeover Law on the Transactions.

 

7.8 _Parent Common Stock Listed_. Parent shall prepare and submit to the NYSE
a listing application covering the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
in the Mergers and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to the
Effective Time, approval for the listing of such shares of Parent Common Stock
on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.

 

7.9 _Third-Party Approvals_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and the
Partnership and their respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all
filings, to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
Governmental Authorities and third parties necessary to consummate the
Transactions and to comply with the terms and conditions of such permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations and to cause the Mergers to be
consummated as expeditiously as practicable. Each of Parent and the
Partnership has the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable
each will consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, with respect to, all material written
information submitted to any third party or any Governmental Authorities in
connection with the Transactions. In exercising the foregoing right, each of
the Parties agrees to act reasonably and promptly. Each Party agrees that it
will consult with the Other Parties with respect to the obtaining of
all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
Transactions, and each Party will keep the Other Parties apprised of the
status of material matters relating to completion of the Transactions.

(b) Each of the Parties agrees, upon request, to furnish one another with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
unitholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
in connection with the Partnership Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement
or any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of another Party or
any of such other Partys Subsidiaries to any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions.

 

7.10 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment
or indemnification agreement or under the Existing Partnership Agreement,
this Agreement or, if applicable, similar governing documents or agreements of
any of the Partnerships Subsidiaries, from and after the LP Merger Effective
Time, Parent, the Surviving MGP Entity, the Surviving EGP Entity and the
Surviving Partnership Entity, jointly and severally, will: (i) indemnify and
hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior
to the LP Merger Effective Time, an Indemnitee (as defined in the Existing
Partnership Agreement) or an officer, director, board observer, or employee of
the Partnership Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries and also with
respect to any such Person, in their capacity as a director, officer, board
observer, employee, member,

 



73

    

 trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, foundation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (whether
or not such other entity or enterprise is affiliated with the Partnership
Entities) serving at the request of or on behalf of the Partnership Entities
or any of their respective Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in connection
with any Claim or Action against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, Indemnification Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid
in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) resulting therefrom;
and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or advance to each of the Indemnified
Parties, any Indemnification Expenses incurred in defending, serving as
a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any
Claim or Action in advance of the final disposition of such Claim or Action,
including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any
Indemnification Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification or advancement,
in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security but subject
to Parents receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified
Party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified. The indemnification and
advancement obligations of Parent, the Surviving MGP Entity, the Surviving
EGP Entity and the Surviving Partnership Entity pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 7.10(a)_ extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the LP Merger
Effective Time and any Claim or Action relating thereto (including with
respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the
consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in
connection therewith and any Claim or Action relating thereto), and all
rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder continue as to
any Indemnified Party who has ceased to be an Indemnitee (as defined in the
Existing Partnership Agreement) or a director, board observer, officer or
employee of the Partnership Entities or any of their Subsidiaries after the
date of this Agreement and inure to the benefit of such Persons heirs,
executors and personal and legal representatives. As used in this _Section_
__ _ 7.10_: (x) the term " _Claim_ " means any threatened, asserted, pending
or completed action or proceeding, whether instituted by any Party, any
Governmental Authority or any other Person, that any Indemnified Party in
good faith believes might lead to the institution of any action or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including any
arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism (" _Action_ "),
arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified
Partys duties or service as a director, officer, board observer or employee
of the Partnership Entities or of any of their respective Subsidiaries or as
a trustee of (or in a similar capacity with) any compensation and benefit plan
of any thereof or otherwise by reason of its status as an Indemnified Party;
and (y) the term " _Indemnification Expenses_ " means documented out-of-
pocket attorneys fees and expenses and all other reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs, expenses and obligations paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in,
any Claim for which indemnification is sought pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.10(a)_, including any Action relating to a claim for indemnification or
advancement brought by an Indemnified Party.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and the Merger Subsidiaries agree
that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the LP Merger
Effective Time now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in
the Existing Partnership Agreement (or, as applicable, the

 



74

    

 charter, bylaws, partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement,
or other governing documents of any of MGP, EGP or the Partnerships
Subsidiaries) and indemnification agreements of the Partnership Entities or
any of their respective Subsidiaries will be assumed by the Surviving MGP
Entity, the Surviving EGP Entity and the Surviving Partnership Entity and
Parent in the Mergers, without further action, at the LP Merger Effective
Time and will survive the Mergers and continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

(c) For a period of six years from the LP Merger Effective Time, Parent will
maintain in effect the current directors and officers liability and
fiduciary liability insurance policies covering the Indemnified Parties (but
may substitute therefor other policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Parties and issued by an insurer rated as to claims paying ability
at least as highly as the current insurer under such policies so long as that
substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to
matters occurring or alleged to have occurred on or before the LP Merger
Effective Time), but Parent is not required to pay annual premiums in
excess of 300% of the last annual premiums paid therefor prior to the date of
this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") and will purchase the maximum amount
of coverage that can be obtained for that amount if the coverage described in
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.10(c)_ would cost in excess of that amount. If Parent
elects (or, if Parent elects not to, if the Partnership elects), then Parent
may (or may require the Partnership to (in which case the Partnership shall)),
or the Partnership may, as applicable, on or prior to the LP Merger Effective
Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect to acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred prior to the LP Merger Effective Time that were
committed or alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified Parties in
their capacity as such; _provided_ that in no event shall the cost of such
policy exceed six times the Maximum Amount and, if such a "tail policy" is
purchased, neither Parent nor the Surviving MGP Entity, the Surviving EGP
Entity and the Surviving Partnership Entity shall have any further obligations
under this _Section_ __ _ 7.10(c)_.

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving MGP Entity, the Surviving EGP Entity, the
Surviving Partnership Entity or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Entity assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
7.10_. 

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving MGP Entity, the Surviving EGP Entity and
the Surviving Partnership Entity to perform all of their respective
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.10_.

(f) This _Section_ __ _ 7.10_ survives the consummation of the Mergers and
is intended to be for the benefit of, and to be enforceable by, the
Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and personal representatives,
and will be binding on Parent, the Surviving MGP Entity, the Surviving EGP
Entity, the Surviving Partnership Entity and their respective successors and
assigns.

 



75

    

7.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Subject to applicable Law,
the Partnership Entities shall give prompt notice to Parent, and the Parent
Entities shall give prompt notice to the Partnership, to the extent in each
case it obtains Knowledge thereof of (i) any written notice or other written
communication received by such Party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions, or from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions,
provided the subject matter of any such communication would reasonably be
expected to be material to the Partnership or Parent, (ii) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or threatened against, or
involving as a party thereto, such Party or any of its Subsidiaries that
relate to the Transactions, or (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance
that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which, would result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the
conditions to the Closing in _Article_ __ _ VIII_; _provided_ that, in the
case of _clause (iii)_ , the failure to comply with this _Section_ __ _
7.11_ shall not in and of itself result in the failure to be satisfied of any
of the conditions to the Closing in _Article_ __ _ VIII_, or give rise to any
right to terminate this Agreement under _Article_ __ _ IX_ if the underlying
fact, circumstance or event would not in and of itself give rise to such
failure or right.

 

7.12 _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the LP Merger Effective Time,
Parent and the Partnership Entities will take such reasonable steps as each
determines in its discretion may be required (to the extent permitted under
applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Partnership Units (including
derivative securities with respect to Partnership Units) or acquisition of
Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent
Common Stock) resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Partnership, or will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

 

7.13 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing and for a period of twelve months thereafter,
Parent shall provide, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to provide, to
each employee of the Partnership or its Affiliates who continues to be
employed by Parent or any Affiliate thereof (the " _Continuing Employees_ "),
for so long as the applicable Continuing Employee remains employed
during such period, (i) at least the same wage rate or base salary as in
effect for the applicable Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
Closing, (ii) target annual bonus opportunities that are no less favorable
than as in effect for the applicable Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Closing ( _provided, however_ , that to the extent the wage rate or base
salary of the applicable Continuing Employee is increased, the target annual
bonus opportunity of the applicable Continuing Employee may be
correspondingly decreased), and (iii) all other compensation and employee
benefits (excluding base salaries and wage rates and target annual bonus
opportunities) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility
to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of
Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employees
after the Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee shall,
subject to applicable law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be
credited with his

 



76

    

 or her years of service with the Partnership and its Affiliates and their
respective predecessors before the Closing to the same extent credited under a
corresponding Partnership Employee Benefit Plan; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
that coverage under such New Plan is of the same type as the
Partnership Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the Closing (such plans, collectively, the "
_Old Plans_ "), and (ii) (A) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent
or its applicable Affiliate shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents and (B) Parent and its applicable Subsidiary shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) At or prior to the LP Merger Effective Time, the Partnership shall (i)
adopt and promulgate to its employees a severance, transition services and
compensation plan binding upon the Partnership, which shall continue in effect
following the LP Merger Effective Time, in substantially the form of _Section_
__ _ 7.13(c)_ of the Partnership Disclosure Letter; and (ii) take such other
actions which are described on _Section_ __ _ 7.13(c)_ of the Partnership
Disclosure Letter.

 

(d) If, at least ten (10) business days prior to the Closing, Parent provides
written notice to the Partnership directing the Partnership to terminate its
401(k) plan(s), the Partnership shall terminate any and all 401(k) plans
effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _401(k)
Termination Date_ "). In the event that Parent requests that such 401(k)
plan(s) be terminated, the Partnership shall provide Parent with evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Parent that such 401(k) plan(s) have been
terminated at least two business days prior to the Closing Date; _provided_
that prior to terminating the Partnerships 401(k) plan, the Partnership
shall provide Parent with the form and substance of any applicable resolutions
for review (and the Partnership shall consider any of Parents comments in
good faith). If the Partnership 401(k) plan is terminated pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.13(d)_, then as soon as practicable following the 401(k)
Termination Date, Parent shall permit all Continuing Employees who were
eligible to participate in the Partnership 401(k) plan immediately prior to
the 401(k) Termination Date to participate in Parents 401(k) plan, and shall
permit each such Continuing Employee to elect to transfer his or her account
balance when distributed from the terminated Partnership 401(k) plan,
including any outstanding participant loans, to Parents 401(k) plan, except
to the extent that accepting such transfers would adversely affect the tax-
qualified status of Parents 401(k) plan or as may be prohibited by Parents
401(k) plan.

the business or operations of the Partnership or its Subsidiaries, (B) require
the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries to agree to pay any fees, reimburse
any expenses or otherwise incur any liability or give any indemnities prior
to the Closing for which it is not promptly reimbursed or simultaneously

a " _Payoff Letter_ ") executed by the holders of respective obligations under
the Partnership Credit Agreements (or, if applicable, their agent or
representative), as applicable, (ii) on or prior to the Closing Date, deliver
all notices required pursuant to the terms of each Partnership Credit
Agreement, as applicable, and other documents related thereto to facilitate
the repayment of the obligations outstanding thereunder and (c) make

(e) Each of the Parent Entities and the Partnership Entities acknowledges and

(f) The Continuing Partnership will be responsible for the preparation of all
income Tax Returns for the Partnership and its Subsidiaries that include any
taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, to
the extent that such income Tax Returns are required to be filed after the
Closing Date, including, for the avoidance of doubt, income Tax Returns for
the taxable year that includes the Closing Date (collectively, the "
_Partnership Income Tax Returns_ "). The Partnership Income Tax Returns shall
be prepared in a manner materially consistent with the Partnerships past
practices except (i) as required by applicable Law or (ii) as would not
materially affect the Tax liability of the Partnership Unitholders
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing for any taxable periods or
portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date.

 

(g) Following the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including Parent Opco) not to, amend, refile or otherwise modify any
Partnership Income Tax Returns, except as required by applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Partnership shall make
any election available to be made by it under Section 6226 of the Code (or a
similar provision of state, local or other Tax Law) with respect to the
alternative to payment of imputed underpayment by the Partnership for any
taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, and
the relevant parties shall take any other action such as filings, disclosures
and notifications necessary to effectuate such election.

(h) The Parties agree that (i) the Regular Consideration (plus any other
items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes) will be
allocated among the underlying assets of the Partnership (and, to the extent
applicable, its Subsidiaries) for purposes of Section 751 of the Code and the
statements required to be filed under Treasury Regulations Section
1.751-1(a)(3) (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, as
applicable) (the " _Regular Merger Consideration Allocation_ ") and (ii) the
GP Merger 1 Consideration and GP Merger 2 Consideration (plus any other items
that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes) will be
allocated among the underlying assets of MGP and EGP, respectively (and, to
the extent applicable, among the underlying assets of the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries), for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the " _GP Merger
Consideration Allocation_ ", and together with the Regular Merger
Consideration Allocation, the " _Tax Merger Consideration Allocation_ "), in
each case, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations. Within 60 calendar days after the Date of this
Agreement, Parent shall provide the Partnership with a proposed Tax Merger
Consideration Allocation, together with a proposed schedule of initial Gross

 



81

    

 Asset Values for Parent Opcos assets pursuant to and as defined in the
Amended Parent Opco Limited Partnership Agreement (such proposed schedule,
together with the Tax Merger Consideration Allocation, the " _Proposed
Allocation_ "). Within 20 days after the date of the delivery of such Proposed
Allocation to the Partnership, the Partnership shall propose to Parent any
reasonable changes to such Proposed Allocation in writing or otherwise shall
be deemed to have agreed with such Proposed Allocation upon the expiration of
such 20 day period. The Partnership and Parent shall cooperate in good faith
to mutually agree to an appropriate allocation and schedule of initial Gross
Asset Values. In the event the Partnership and Parent are unable to agree as
to the Tax Merger Consideration Allocation or initial Gross Asset Values
within 15 calendar days following the delivery of any changes to the
Proposed Allocation by the Partnership to Parent, then the Partnership and
Parent shall submit all items remaining in dispute to a nationally recognized
accounting firm selected jointly by the parties (" _Accounting Firm_ ") for
resolution. The fees and expenses of Accounting Firm pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.18(h)_ shall be paid equally by the Partnership, on the one
hand, and Parent, on the other hand; provided, that the Partnership shall pay
its portion of any fees and expenses prior to Closing, including by means of
an advanced deposit in an amount that is reasonably expected to be sufficient
to cover its portion of any fees and expenses. Accounting Firm shall
determine, based solely on the submissions by the Partnership and Parent, and
not by independent review, only those issues related to the determination of
the Tax Merger Consideration Allocation and the initial Gross Asset Values
that remain in dispute. The parties shall prepare and file all applicable Tax
Returns and any related forms and statements in a manner consistent with such
Tax Merger Consideration Allocation and initial Gross Asset Values as finally
determined in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.18(h)_, except as
required by applicable Law following a final determination by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other final decision by an applicable Governmental
Authority.

 

(i) The Partnership will apply the interim closing method under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.706-4 with respect to the transfer of Partnership Units
in connection with the Mergers, using a daily convention and treating any non-
ordinary course transactions occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing
as extraordinary items; provided, that to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law, any and all deductions related to any transaction expenses
paid on or prior to the Closing Date in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that are deductible for Tax purposes shall be
allocated to the period prior to the Closing.

 

(j) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Partnership shall use reasonable best
efforts to provide, with respect to each Protected Interest (as defined in
Exhibit C), an estimated computation of (together with any supporting
documentation reasonably requested by Parent): (i) the initial Built-In Gain
(as defined in Exhibit C and, for the avoidance of doubt, consistent with the
Tax Merger Consideration Allocation) amount with respect to each such
Protected Interest as of the Closing Date, (ii) each Applicable Partners
adjusted tax basis in each such Protected Interest as of the Closing Date,
(iii) each Applicable Partners share of the aggregate Built-In Gain with
respect to each such Protected Interest as of the Closing Date, and (iv) the
amount of any adjustment under Section 734 or 743 of the Code that could
affect the calculation of the Built-In Gain or Applicable Tax Liability (as
defined in Exhibit C) with respect to each such Protected Interest as of the
Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 7.18(j), "Applicable Partner"
shall mean any holder of Partnership Units that owns, or whose Partnership
Units are beneficially owned by persons beneficially owning, 130,000 or more
Partnership Units immediately prior to Closing (for this purpose, beneficial
ownership means beneficial ownership within the meaning of Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act, as modified to include a persons spouse and a persons
children living at home).

and the Transactions at the Partnership Meeting and at all adjournments
or postponements thereof.

Protection Agreement_. Prior to the LP Merger Effective Time, each of Parent
and Parent Opco shall, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to,
(i) convert Parent Opco from a limited liability company into a limited
partnership in accordance with applicable Law, with Parent as the sole
general partner of Parent Opco and, in connection with such conversion, enter
into a limited partnership agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Partnership, (ii) cause a wholly owned limited liability

shall, immediately prior to the GP Merger 1 Effective Time, effect a pro rata
distribution to their respective stockholders of all the Partnership Units
held beneficially and of record by MGP and EGP, as applicable (the " _GP Pre-

Agreement, the Election Deadline with respect to Partnership Units distributed
in the GP Pre-Closing Distribution shall be the date of the GP Pre-Closing

deemed properly made by a stockholder of MGP or EGP if properly completed and
duly executed Election Forms related to such Partnership Units are delivered
by such stockholder to Parent on or prior to such date.

the Pope Private REITs from Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP (or such other
nationally recognized REIT tax counsel as may be reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Partnership), dated as of the Closing Date and in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that, commencing
with the taxable year ended (i) with respect to ORM Timber Fund II, Inc.,
December 31, 2011, (ii) with respect to ORM Timber Fund III (REIT) Inc.,
December 31, 2014, and (iii) with respect to ORM Timber Fund IV (REIT) Inc.,

Pope Private REITs organization and current and proposed method of operation
(as described in the applicable representation letter) will enable such Pope
Private REIT to continue to satisfy the requirements for qualification and
taxation as a REIT under the Code (which opinion shall be based upon the
representation letter described in _Section_ __ _ 7.18(c)(iii)_ and subject
to customary exceptions, assumptions and qualifications).

(d) by Parent if (i) any Partnership Entity has breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, or (ii) any representation or warranty of any Partnership
Entity becomes untrue, and, with respect to either _clause_ __ _ (i)_ or
_(ii)_ above, which breach, failure to perform or untruth if it was
continuing as of the Closing Date would result in the failure of the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ or _(b)_ to be satisfied and
such breach, failure to perform or untruth is incapable of being cured (or
becoming true) or, if capable of being cured (or becoming true), is not cured
(or does not becomes true) by the earlier of (x) the Outside Date or (y)
within 30 days following receipt by the Partnership of written notice from
Parent of such breach, failure or untruth describing the same in reasonable
detail; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)_ shall not be available to Parent if it or any of the
Parent Entities are then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement;

 

(e) by the Partnership if (i) any Parent Entity has breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, or (ii) any representation or warranty of Parent
becomes untrue, and, with respect to either _clause_ __ _ (i)_ or (ii) above,
which breach, failure to perform or untruth if it was continuing as of the
Closing Date would result in the failure of the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ or _(b)_ to be satisfied and such breach, failure to
perform or untruth is incapable of being cured (or becoming true) or, if
capable of being cured (or becoming true), is not cured (or does not becomes
true) by the earlier of (x) the Outside Date or (y) within 30 days following
receipt by Parent of written notice from the Partnership of such breach,
failure or untruth describing the same in reasonable detail; _provided_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(e) shall not be
available to the Partnership if it is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement;

(f) by the Partnership or Parent if the Closing does not occur on or before
October 14, 2020 (the " _Outside Date_ ") (except that, if on the Outside Date
any of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)(iii)_ or _Section_
__ _ 8.1(a)(iv)_ shall not have been satisfied but all other conditions set
forth in _Article_ __ _ VIII_ shall have been satisfied or waived or shall
then be capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to take place on such
date, then the Outside Date shall be automatically extended to January 14,
2021); _provided_ , _however_ , that such failure of the Closing to occur is
not due to the failure of such Party to perform and comply in all material
respects with the covenants and agreements to be performed or complied with
by such Party prior to the Closing;

 



87

    

(g) by the Partnership or Parent if the Partnership Meeting (including any
adjournments or postponements thereof) has concluded and the Partnership

(i) by the Partnership, if (A) all of the closing conditions applicable to

9.2 _Procedure Upon Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by Parent or the Partnership, or both, pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
9.1_, written notice thereof specifying the provision pursuant to which such
termination is made and the basis therefor will forthwith be given to the
Other Parties, and this Agreement will terminate without further action by
the Parties.

9.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, then each of the Parties
will be relieved of its duties and obligations arising under this Agreement
after the date of such termination and such termination will be without
liability to Parent or the Partnership; _provided_ , that the agreements and
obligations of the Parties and the other provisions set forth in _Section_ __
_ 5.26_, _Section_ __ _ 6.18_, _Section_ __ _ 7.6,_  _Section_ __ _
7.17(b)_, this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ and _Article_ __ _
X_ hereof will survive any such termination and are enforceable hereunder; 
_provided_ , _however_ , no such termination shall relieve any Party from
liability for damages to another party resulting from Fraud or a Willful
Breach of this Agreement (including in the event of a termination pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.1(j)_), in which case the
breaching party shall be liable to the damaged party for damages.

 

9.4 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.1(h)_, then the Partnership will pay to Parent, within two Business
Days after the date of termination, the Termination Fee.

 



88

    

(b) In the event that (i) an Alternative Proposal is submitted or proposed to
any Partnership Entity or its equityholders following the date of this
Agreement and prior to the date of the Partnership Meeting and (ii) this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to (x) _ Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)_ as a result
of a Willful Breach of any covenant or agreement of the Partnership Entities
or _Section_ __ _ 9.1(j)_ or (y) _ Section_ __ _ 9.1(g)_ and (iii) within
15 months after the date this Agreement is terminated, the Partnership enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, an Alternative
Proposal, then the Partnership will pay to Parent the Termination Fee, upon
the earlier of the public announcement that the Partnership has entered
into such definitive agreement or the consummation of any such transaction.
For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_, the term " _Alternative
Proposal_ " has the meaning assigned to such term in  _Section_ __ _
7.3(i)(i)_, except that the references to "25% or more" are deemed to be
references to "50% or more."

 

(c) Any payment of the Termination Fee will be made in cash by wire transfer
of same day funds to an account designated in writing by the recipient of
such payment. In the event that the Partnership is obligated to pay Parent the
Termination Fee, the Partnership shall pay to Parent from the Termination Fee
deposited into escrow in accordance with the next sentence, an amount equal
to the lesser of (i) the Termination Fee, as applicable, and (ii) the sum of
(A) the maximum amount that can be paid to Parent (or its designee) without
causing Parent (or its designee) to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined
as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in
Sections 856(c)(2)(A) through (H) or 856(c)(3)(A) through (I) of the Code ("
_Qualifying Income_ "), as determined by Parents independent certified
public accountants (taking into account any known or anticipated income of
Parent which is not Qualifying Income and any appropriate "cushion" as
determined by such accountants), plus (B) in the event Parent receives either
a letter from Parents counsel indicating that Parent has received a ruling
from the IRS described in _Section_ __ _ 9.4(d)(ii)_ or an opinion from
Parents outside counsel as described in _Section_ __ _ 9.4(d)(ii)_, an
amount equal to the excess of the Termination Fee less the amount payable
under clause (A) above. To secure the Partnerships obligation to pay these
amounts, the Partnership shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to
the Termination Fee with an escrow agent selected by the Partnership (that is
reasonably satisfactory to Parent) and on such terms (subject to  _Section_
__ _ 9.4(d)_) as shall be mutually agreed in good faith upon by the
Partnership, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow
of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section _ 9.4(c)_ shall be made, at
the time the Partnership is obligated to pay Parent such amount pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.4_, by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

 

(d) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Termination Fee in escrow or
any portion thereof shall not be released to Parent (or its designee) unless
the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a
letter from Parents independent certified public accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Parent (or
its designee) without causing Parent (or its designee) to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the
payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent
letter from Parents accountants revising that amount, in which case the
escrow agent shall release such amount to Parent (or its designee), or (ii) a
letter from Parents counsel indicating that Parent received a ruling from the
IRS holding that the receipt by Parent (or its designee) of the Termination
Fee would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or
alternatively, indicating that Parents outside counsel has rendered a legal
opinion to the effect that

 



89

    

 the receipt by Parent (or its designee) of the Termination Fee should either
constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within
the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which case the
escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Termination Fee to Parent (or
its designee). The Partnership agrees to amend this _Section_ __ _ 9.4(d)_ at
the request of Parent in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Termination
Fee that may be distributed to Parent (or its designee) hereunder without
causing Parent (or its designee) to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve Parents chances of securing a
favorable ruling described in this _Section_ __ _ 9.4(d)_ or (z) assist
Parent in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as
described in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.4(d)_. The escrow agreement shall also
provide that any portion of the Termination Fee that remains unpaid as of the
end of the taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following
taxable year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this _Section_ __ _
9.4_; _provided_ , that the obligation of the Partnership to pay the unpaid
portion of the Termination Fee shall terminate on the December 31 following
the date which is four (4) years from the date of this Agreement and any such
unpaid portion shall be released by the escrow agent to the Partnership.

 

(e) As used herein, " _Termination Fee_ " means a cash amount equal to
$20,000,000. In no event shall Parent be entitled to more than one payment of
the Termination Fee.

(f) Each of the Parties acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and
that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement and (ii) the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which such amounts are due and payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amounts would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. In the event that the Termination Fee
is required to be paid to Parent under this  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, other than
any rights or remedies available to a party under this Agreement due to a
Fraud or Willful Breach of another party (it being understood that, (x) where
Parent has already received a Termination Fee, Parent shall only be entitled
to recover damages or monetary recovery for any loss in excess of the amount
of such Termination Fee and (y) where Parent has already recovered damages or
other monetary recovery, Parent shall only be entitled to receive the portion
of the Termination Fee (if any) in excess of the amount of such damages or
other monetary recovery), the Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy available to the Parent Entities, and the Parent Entities shall
be precluded from any other remedy against the Partnership Entities, and upon
payment of such amount, none of the Partnership Related Persons shall have any
liability or obligation to any Person, whether in law, equity, contract, tort
or otherwise relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions. The Partnership Related Persons are intended third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 9.4(f)_. For purposes of this Agreement,
the " _Partnership Related Persons_ " shall mean, collectively, the
Partnership Entities, the Partnerships Subsidiaries, their respective
Affiliates and their respective Representatives.

10.8 _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions hereof

Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.

10.9  _Jurisdiction_.

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware or, if such Court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, to the Complex Commercial Litigation Division of the Superior
Court of the State of Delaware or, if jurisdiction is vested exclusively in
the Federal courts of the United States, the Federal courts of the United
States sitting in the State of Delaware, and any appellate court from any such
state or Federal court, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree that
all claims with respect to any such claim shall be heard and determined in
such Delaware court or in such Federal court, as applicable. The Parties agree
that a final judgment in any such claim is conclusive and may be enforced in
any other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law.

 

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter in any
Delaware state or Federal court located in the State of Delaware and the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such claim in any such
court.

(c) Each of the Parties agrees that it will not, and it will not permit any
of its controlled Affiliates to, bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind of description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against
any Financing Source or any Financing Related Party, in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, in any state
court located in the Borough of Manhattan (and the Parties hereto agree to
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, such court in
connection therewith), and that the provisions _Section_ __ _ 10.10_ relating
to waiver of jury trial shall apply to such action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim.

 

10.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law
that cannot be waived, each Party hereby irrevocably waives and covenants
that it will not assert (whether as plaintiff, defendant or otherwise) any
right to trial by jury in any forum in respect of any issue, claim, demand,
action or cause of action arising in whole or in part under, related
to, based on, or in connection with, this Agreement or the subject matter
hereof, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether sounding in tort
or contract or otherwise. Any Party may file an original counterpart or a copy
of this  _Section_ __ _ 10.10_ with any court as written evidence of the
consent of each such Party to the waiver of its right to trial by jury.

 



94

    

10.11 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as Parties
and no past, present or future Affiliate, director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, manager, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney or
representative of any Party has any liability for any obligations or
liabilities of the Parties or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the Transactions.

10.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 10.12_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any state or
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (x) any Party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Each Party further agrees that no Party shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this  _Section_ __ _
10.12_, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if, prior to the
Outside Date, a Party brings any Proceeding to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended by the amount of time during which such Proceeding is pending, plus
ten (10) Business Days, or such longer period of time established by the
court presiding over such Proceeding.

10.13  _Survival_. None of the representations, warranties, agreements and
covenants contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement if this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with  _Article_ __ _ IX_ prior to the Closing; _provided,
however_ , that if the Closing occurs, the agreements of the Parties and the
other provisions set forth in _Sections 3.2_ , _ 3.3_, _3.4_ , _3.5_ , 
_5.26_ , _7.10_ and _7.13_ , and _Article_ __ _ X_ will survive the Closing,
and if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, the agreements of
the Parties and other provisions set forth in _Sections 5.26_ , _6.18_ , _
7.6_, _7.17(b)_ , _9.2,_ _9.3_ and _9.4_ , and this _Article_ __ _ X_ will
survive such termination. The Confidentiality Agreement shall (i) survive
