surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"); and (b) the separate
existence of HNC shall cease and all of the rights, privileges, powers,

Common Stock (other than Treasury Stock) will be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms of Article III hereof.
Immediately after the Merger, HNB shall merge with and into First
Niagara Bank, with First Niagara Bank as the resulting institution. 

  

2.2. _Effective Time._  

  

The closing ("Closing") shall occur no later than the close of business on the
fifth business day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article IX (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but

forth in the DGCL and the PBCL. 

  

2.6. _Tax Consequences._  

  

It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall
constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that term is used in Sections 354
and 361 of the Code. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the
Closing, each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Merger to qualify, and will not knowingly take any action, cause any action
to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken
which action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a

neither FNFG, HNC nor any of their affiliates shall knowingly take any action,
cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to
fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could cause the Merger to
fail to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. FNFG
and HNC each hereby agrees to deliver certificates substantially
in compliance with IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with customary
exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable counsel to deliver the legal
opinion contemplated by Section 9.1.6, which certificates shall be effective

this Agreement (ii) there are no adverse Federal or state income tax or other
adverse tax consequences to HNC shareholders as a result of the modification;
(iii) the consideration to be paid to the holders of HNC Common Stock under
this Agreement is not thereby changed in kind or value or reduced in amount;
and (iv) such modification will not delay or jeopardize the receipt of
Regulatory Approvals or other consents and approvals relating to the
consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger, otherwise delay or jeopardize
the satisfaction of any condition to 

 

    ##### 

  

   

Closing set forth in Article IX or otherwise adversely affect HNC or the

ARTICLE III 
 CONVERSION OF SHARES 

   

3.1. _Conversion of HNC Common Stock; Merger Consideration._  

  

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of FNFG, HNC or the holders of any of the shares of HNC Common Stock,
the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the following terms: 

  

3.1.1. Each share of FNFG Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger. 

  

3.1.2. All shares of HNC Common Stock held in the treasury of HNC ("Treasury
Stock") and each share of HNC Common Stock owned by FNFG immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in
connection with debts previously contracted) shall, at the Effective Time,
cease to exist, and the certificates for such shares shall be canceled as
promptly as practicable thereafter, and no payment or distribution shall be
made in consideration therefore. 

  

3.1.3. Subject to the provisions of this Article III, each share of HNC Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Treasury Stock) shall become and be converted into, as provided in and
subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the right to receive
0.474 shares of FNFG Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio"), subject
to adjustment in accordance with Section 3.1.7. 

  

3.1.4. After the Effective Time, shares of HNC Common Stock shall be no longer
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
shall thereafter by operation of this section represent the right to receive
the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto or any dividends or distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that were declared or made by HNC on such shares of HNC Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the
Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. 

  

3.1.5. In the event FNFG changes (or establishes a record date for changing)
the number of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of FNFG Common Stock
issued and 

 

    ##### 

  

   

outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar transaction with
respect to the outstanding FNFG Common Stock and the record date therefor
shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be
proportionately and appropriately adjusted; _provided_ , _that_ no
such adjustment shall be made with regard to FNFG Common Stock if FNFG issues
additional shares of FNFG Common Stock and receives fair market value
consideration for such shares. 

  

3.1.6. _No Fractional Shares._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
FNFG Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to FNFG Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share interest, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a shareholder of FNFG. In lieu of the issuance of any
such fractional share, FNFG shall pay to each former holder of HNC Common
Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of
FNFG Common Stock, an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without
interest, equal to the product of (i) the fraction of a share to which such
holder would otherwise have been entitled and (ii) the average of the daily
closing sales prices of a share of FNFG Common Stock as reported on the
Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Closing
Date. For purposes of determining any fractional share interest, all shares
of HNC Common Stock owned by an HNC shareholder shall be combined so as to
calculate the maximum number of whole shares of FNFG Common Stock issuable to
such HNC shareholder. 

  

3.1.7. _Adjustment to Exchange Ratio._ If the aggregate amount of HNC
Delinquent Loans as of the month end prior to the Closing Date is
$237,500,000 or greater, the Exchange Ratio shall adjust in the manner set
forth in Exhibit C (which Exchange Ratio as adjusted in accordance with
Exhibit C shall become the "Exchange Ratio" for purposes of this Agreement).
Provided further, that if the Closing Date is subsequent to March 31, 2010,
the aggregate amount of HNC Delinquent Loans shall be calculated as of
February 28, 2010 for purposes of any adjustment in the Exchange Ratio. 

  

3.2. _Procedures for Exchange of HNC Common Stock._  

  

3.2.1. _FNFG to Make Merger Consideration Available._ At or prior to the
Effective Time, FNFG shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of HNC Common Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this Section 3.2, certificates representing the
shares of FNFG Common Stock and an aggregate amount of cash sufficient to pay
the aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to this Article III (including
any cash that may be payable in lieu of any fractional shares of HNC Common
Stock) (such cash and certificates for shares of FNFG Common Stock, together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). 

  

3.2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. FNFG shall cause the Exchange Agent, within
five (5) business days after the Effective Time, to mail to each holder of a
Certificate or Certificates, a form letter of transmittal for return to the
Exchange Agent and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates for the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, into which the HNC Common Stock represented by
such Certificates 

 

    ##### 

  

   

shall have been converted as a result of the Merger. The letter of transmittal
shall be subject to the approval of HNC (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and specify that delivery shall be
affected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent. Upon proper surrender
of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
as applicable, (i) a certificate representing that number of shares of
FNFG Common Stock (if any) to which such former holder of HNC Common Stock
shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1 hereof
and (ii) a check representing the amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu of
fractional shares of FNFG Common Stock, which such former holder has the
right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the
provisions of Section 3.2, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable in lieu
of fractional shares. 

  

3.2.3. _Rights of Certificate Holders after the Effective Time_. The holder of
a Certificate that prior to the Merger represented issued and outstanding HNC
Common Stock shall have no rights, after the Effective Time, with respect to
such HNC Common Stock except to surrender the Certificate in exchange for the
Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. No dividends or
other distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect to FNFG
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with
this Section 3.2. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with
this Section 3.2, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive,
without any interest thereon, any such dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time, which theretofore had become payable
with respect to shares of FNFG Common Stock represented by such
Certificate. 

  

3.2.4. _Surrender by Persons Other than Record Holders_. If the Person
surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying letter of transmittal
is not the record holder thereof, then it shall be a condition of the payment
of the Merger Consideration that: (i) such Certificate is properly endorsed
to such Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either
case signed exactly as the name of the record holder appears on such
Certificate, and is otherwise in proper form for transfer, or is accompanied
by appropriate evidence of the authority of the Person surrendering such
Certificate and signing the letter of transmittal to do so on behalf of
the record holder; and (ii) the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish
to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is
not payable. 

  

3.2.5. _Closing of Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of HNC of the HNC Common
Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time other than to settle transfers of HNC Common Stock that occurred prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the
Exchange Agent, they shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration and
canceled as provided in this Section 3.2. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

3.2.6. _Return of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the twelve (12) month
period after the Effective Time, FNFG shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portions of the Exchange Fund which had
been made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Certificates (including, without limitation, all interest and other income
received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to it),
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to FNFG (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) with respect to any
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither FNFG nor
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any
Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Certificate to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar
law. 

  

3.2.7. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by FNFG, the posting by such person of
a bond in such amount as FNFG may reasonably direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof. 

  

3.2.8. _Withholding._ FNFG or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of HNC Common
Stock such amounts as FNFG (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Exchange Agent
are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or
non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by
FNFG or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
HNC Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made
by FNFG or the Exchange Agent. 

  

3.2.9. _Treatment of HNC Options_. HNC Disclosure Schedule 3.2.9 sets forth
all of the outstanding HNC Options as of the date hereof, which schedule
includes, for each option grant, the name of the individual grantee, the date
of grant, the exercise price, the vesting schedule and the expiration date. 

  

(a) At the Effective Time, all HNC Options which are outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior thereto shall become fully vested and
exercisable and be converted, in their entirety, automatically into fully
vested and exercisable options to purchase shares of FNFG Common Stock (the
"Continuing Options") in an amount and at an exercise price determined as
provided below (and otherwise subject to the terms of HNC Option Plans): 

   

(1) The number of shares of FNFG Common Stock to be subject to the
Continuing Options shall be equal to the product of the number of shares of
HNC Common Stock subject to the HNC Options and the Exchange Ratio, provided
that any fractional  shares of FNFG Common Stock resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest share; and 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(2) The exercise price per share of FNFG Common Stock under the
Continuing Options shall be equal to the exercise price per share of HNC
Common Stock under the HNC Options divided by the Exchange Ratio, provided
that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent. 

  

The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options which are
"incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) shall be and is intended to be
effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.
The duration and other terms of the Continuing Options shall be the same as
the HNC Options, except that all references to HNC shall be deemed to be
references to FNFG. 

  

(b) At all times after the Effective Time, FNFG shall reserve for issuance
such number of shares of FNFG Common Stock as necessary so as to permit the
exercise of Continuing Options in the manner contemplated by this Agreement
and in the instruments pursuant to which such options were granted.

the HNC Options in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to
applicable law and regulation.

4.6.1. HNC has previously made available to FNFG the HNC Regulatory Reports.
The HNC Regulatory Reports have been prepared in all material respects in

access thereto and there from), except for any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control 

 

    ##### 

  

   

that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
system of internal accounting controls described below in this Section 4.6.4.
HNC (x) has implemented and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as required by Rule 13a-15(a) of the Exchange Act) that
is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of its financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP, (y) has implemented and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to HNC, including
its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer
and the chief financial officer of HNC by others within those entities, and
(z) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date
hereof, to HNCÂ’s outside auditors and the audit committee of HNCÂ’s Board of
Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect HNCÂ’s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
HNCÂ’s internal control over financial reporting. These disclosures (if any)
were made in writing by management to HNCÂ’s auditors and audit committee and
a copy has previously been made available to FNFG. As of the date hereof, to
the knowledge of HNC, its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
will be able to give the certifications required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
without qualification, when next due. 

  

4.6.5. Since December 31, 2008, (i) neither HNC nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the Knowledge of HNC, any director, officer, employee, auditor,
accountant or representative of HNC or any of its Subsidiaries has received
or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting
or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of HNC or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that HNC or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in illegal accounting or auditing practices, and
(ii) no attorney representing HNC or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by HNC or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of Securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by HNC or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to
the Board of Directors of HNC or any committee thereof or to any director or
officer of HNC. 

  

4.7. _Taxes._  

  

HNC and the HNC Subsidiaries are members of the same affiliated group within
the meaning of Code Section 1504(a). HNC and each HNC Subsidiary has duly
filed all federal, state and material local tax returns required to be filed
by or with respect to HNC and every HNC Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing
Date, taking into account any extensions (all such returns, to
HNCÂ’s Knowledge, being accurate and correct in all material respects) and has
duly paid or made provisions for the payment of all material federal, state
and local taxes which have been incurred by or are due or claimed to be due
from HNC and any HNC Subsidiary by any taxing authority or pursuant to any
written tax sharing agreement on or prior to the Closing Date other than taxes
or other charges which (i) are not delinquent, (ii) are being contested in
good faith, or (iii) have not yet been fully determined. Except as set forth
in HNC Disclosure Schedule 4.7, as of the date of this Agreement, HNC has
received no written notice of, and to HNCÂ’s Knowledge 

 

    ##### 

  

   

there is no audit examination, deficiency assessment, tax investigation or
refund litigation with respect to any taxes of HNC or any HNC Subsidiary, and
no written claim has been made by any authority in a jurisdiction where HNC
or any HNC Subsidiary does not file tax returns that HNC or any HNC
Subsidiary is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. HNC and the HNC
Subsidiaries have not executed an extension or waiver of any statute of
limitations on the assessment or collection of any material tax due that is
currently in effect. HNC and each HNC Subsidiary has withheld and paid all
taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid
or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or
other third party, and HNC and each HNC Subsidiary, to HNCÂ’s Knowledge, has
timely complied with all applicable information reporting requirements under
Part III, Subchapter A of Chapter 61 of the Code and similar applicable
state and local information reporting requirements. 

  

4.8. _No Material Adverse Effect._  

  

HNC has not suffered any Material Adverse Effect since March 31, 2009 and no
event has occurred or circumstance arisen since that date which, in the
aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
on HNC. 

  

4.9. _Material Contracts; Leases; Defaults._  

  

4.9.1. Except as set forth in HNC Disclosure Schedule 4.9.1, neither HNC nor
any HNC Subsidiary is a party to or subject to: (i) any employment,
consulting or severance contract or material arrangement with any past or
present officer, director or employee of HNC or any HNC Subsidiary, except
for "at will" arrangements; (ii) any plan, material arrangement or
contract providing for bonuses, pensions, options, deferred compensation,
retirement payments, profit sharing or similar material arrangements for or
with any past or present officers, directors or employees of HNC or any HNC
Subsidiary; (iii) any collective bargaining agreement with any labor union
relating to employees of HNC or any HNC Subsidiary; (iv) any agreement which
by its terms limits the payment of dividends by HNC or any HNC Subsidiary;
(v) any instrument evidencing or related to material indebtedness for
borrowed money whether directly or indirectly, by way of purchase money
obligation, conditional sale, lease purchase, guaranty or otherwise, in
respect of which HNC or any HNC Subsidiary is an obligor to any person, which
instrument evidences or relates to indebtedness other than deposits,
repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, bankersÂ’ acceptances, and "treasury tax
and loan" accounts and transactions in "federal funds" in each case
established in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice,
or which contains financial covenants or other restrictions (other than those
relating to the payment of principal and interest when due) which would be
applicable on or after the Closing Date to FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary; (vi)
any other agreement, written or oral, that obligates HNC or any HNC Subsidiary
for the payment of more than $50,000 annually or for the payment of more than
$100,000 over its remaining term, which is not terminable without cause on 60
daysÂ’ or less notice without penalty or payment (other than agreements for
commercially available "off-the- shelf" software), or (vii) any
agreement (other than this Agreement), contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding (whether written or oral) that restricts or limits in any
material way the conduct of business by HNC or any HNC Subsidiary (it being
understood that any non-compete or similar provision shall be deemed
material, but any limitation on the scope of any license granted under any
such agreement shall not be deemed material). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

4.9.2. Each real estate lease that requires the consent of the lessor or its
agent resulting from the Merger or the Bank Merger by virtue of the terms of
any such lease, is listed in HNC Disclosure Schedule 4.9.2 identifying the
section of the lease that contains such prohibition or restriction. Subject
to any consents that may be required as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to its Knowledge, neither HNC
nor any HNC Subsidiary is in default in any material respect under any
material contract, agreement, commitment, arrangement, lease, insurance
policy or other instrument to which it is a party, by which its assets,
business, or operations may be bound or affected, or under which it or its
assets, business, or operations receive benefits, and there has not occurred
any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would
constitute such a default. 

  

4.9.3. True and correct copies of agreements, contracts, arrangements and
instruments referred to in Section 4.9.1 and 4.9.2 ("Material Contracts")
have been made available to FNFG on or before the date hereof, and are in
full force and effect on the date hereof and neither HNC nor any
HNC Subsidiary (nor, to the Knowledge of HNC, any other party to any such
contract, arrangement or instrument) has materially breached any provision
of, or is in default in any respect under any term of, any Material Contract.
Except as listed on HNC Disclosure Schedule 4.9.3, no party to any Material
Contract will have the right to terminate any or all of the provisions of any
such Material Contract as a result of the execution of, and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement. 

  

4.9.4. Since December 31, 2008, through and including the date of this
Agreement, except as publicly disclosed by HNC in the Securities Documents
filed or furnished by HNC prior to the date hereof, neither HNC nor any HNC
Subsidiary has (i) except for (A) normal increases for employees (other than
officers and directors subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act) made in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, or (B) as required by applicable law, increased the wages,
salaries, compensation, pension, or other fringe benefits or perquisites
payable to any executive officer, employee, or director from the
amount thereof in effect as of December 31, 2008 (which amounts have been
previously made available to FNFG), granted any severance or termination pay,
entered into any contract to make or grant any severance or termination pay
(except as required under the terms of agreements or severance plans listed
on HNC Disclosure Schedule 4.13.1, as in effect as of the date hereof), or
paid any bonus other than the customary year-end bonuses in amounts
consistent with past practice, (ii) granted any options to purchase shares of
HNC Common Stock, or any right to acquire any shares of its capital stock to
any executive officer, director or employee other than grants to employees
(other than officers subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act) made in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice under HNC Option Plans, (iii) increased or established any
bonus, insurance, severance, deferred compensation, pension, retirement,
profit sharing, stock option (including, without limitation, the granting of
stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance awards, or restricted
stock awards), stock purchase or other employee benefit plan, (iv) made any
material election for federal or state income tax purposes, (v) made any
material change in the credit policies or procedures of HNC or any of
its Subsidiaries, the effect of which was or is to make any such policy or
procedure less restrictive in any material respect, (vi) made any material
acquisition or disposition of any assets or properties, or any contract for
any such acquisition or disposition entered into other than loans and loan
commitments, (vii) entered into any lease of real or personal property
requiring annual payments in excess of $100,000, other than 

 

    ##### 

  

   

in connection with foreclosed property or in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, (viii) changed any accounting methods,
principles or practices of HNC or its Subsidiaries affecting its assets,
liabilities or businesses, including any reserving, renewal or residual
method, practice or policy or (ix) suffered any strike, work stoppage, slow-
down, or other labor disturbance. 

  

4.10. _Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage._  

  

4.10.1. HNC and each HNC Subsidiary has good and, as to real property,
marketable title to all material assets and properties owned by HNC or each
HNC Subsidiary in the conduct of its businesses, whether such assets and
properties are real or personal, tangible or intangible, including assets and
property reflected in the balance sheets contained in the HNC
Regulatory Reports and in the HNC Financial Statements or acquired subsequent
thereto (except to the extent that such assets and properties have been
disposed of in the ordinary course of business, since the date of such
balance sheets), subject to no material encumbrances, liens, mortgages,
security interests or pledges, except (i) those items which secure
liabilities for public or statutory obligations or any discount with,
borrowing from or other obligations to FHLB, inter-bank credit facilities, or
any transaction by an HNC Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity, (ii)
statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which are being contested
in good faith, (iii) non-monetary liens affecting real property which do not
adversely affect the value or use of such real property, and (iv) those
described and reflected in the HNC Financial Statements. HNC and the
HNC Subsidiaries, as lessee, have the right under valid and existing leases
of real and personal properties used by HNC and its Subsidiaries in the
conduct of their businesses to occupy or use all such properties as presently
occupied and used by each of them. 

  

4.10.2. With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which HNC or any
HNC Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement to resell, if
any, HNC or such HNC Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a lien or security
interest (which to HNCÂ’s Knowledge is a valid, perfected first lien) in the
securities or other collateral securing the repurchase agreement, and the
value of such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured
thereby. 

  

4.10.3. HNC and each HNC Subsidiary currently maintain insurance considered by
each of them to be reasonable for their respective operations. Neither HNC
nor any HNC Subsidiary, except as disclosed in HNC Disclosure Schedule
4.10.3, has received notice from any insurance carrier during the past five
years that (i) such insurance will be canceled or that coverage thereunder
will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs (other than with respect
to health or disability insurance) with respect to such policies of insurance
will be substantially increased. There are presently no material claims
pending under such policies of insurance and no notices have been given by
HNC or any HNC Subsidiary under such policies (other than with respect to
health or disability insurance). All such insurance is valid and enforceable
and in full force and effect, and within the last three years HNC and each
HNC Subsidiary has received each type of insurance coverage for which it has
applied and during such periods has not been denied indemnification for any
material claims submitted under any of its insurance policies. HNC Disclosure
Schedule 4.10.3 identifies all material policies of insurance maintained by
HNC and each HNC Subsidiary as well as the other matters required to be
disclosed under this Section. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

4.11. _Legal Proceedings._  

  

Neither HNC nor any HNC Subsidiary is a party to any, and there are no pending
or, to HNCÂ’s Knowledge, threatened legal, administrative, arbitration or
other proceedings, claims (whether asserted or unasserted), actions or
governmental investigations or inquiries of any nature (i) against HNC or any
HNC Subsidiary, (ii) to which HNC or any HNC SubsidiaryÂ’s assets are or may
be subject, (iii) challenging the validity or propriety of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) which could adversely
affect the ability of HNC or HNB to perform under this Agreement, except for
any proceeding, claim, action, investigation or inquiry which, if adversely
determined, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on HNC. 

  

4.12. _Compliance With Applicable Law._  

  

4.12.1. To HNCÂ’s Knowledge, each of HNC and each HNC Subsidiary is in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state, local
and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders
or decrees applicable to it, its properties, assets and deposits, its
business, and its conduct of business and its relationship with
its employees, including, without limitation, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act
of 1977, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and all other applicable fair
lending laws and other laws relating to discriminatory business practices and
neither HNC nor any HNC Subsidiary has received any written notice to the
contrary. The Board of Directors of HNB has adopted and HNB has implemented
an anti-money laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate
customer identification verification procedures that has not been deemed
ineffective by any Governmental Entity and that meets the requirements of
Sections 352 and 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder. 

  

4.12.2. Each of HNC and each HNC Subsidiary has all material permits,
licenses, authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all filings,
applications and registrations with, all Governmental Entities and Bank
Regulators that are required in order to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to conduct its business as presently conducted except where the
failure to hold such permits, licensees, authorizations, orders or approvals,
or the failure to make such filings, applications or registrations would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on HNC; all such permits, licenses, certificates of authority,
orders and approvals are in full force and effect in all material respects
and, to the Knowledge of HNC, no suspension or cancellation of any such
permit, license, certificate, order or approval is threatened or will result
from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
subject to obtaining Regulatory Approvals. 

  

4.12.3. Other than those listed on HNC Disclosure Schedule 4.12.3, for the
period beginning January 1, 2007, neither HNC nor any HNC Subsidiary has
received any written notification or, to HNCÂ’s Knowledge, any other
communication from any Bank Regulator (i) asserting that HNC or any
HNC Subsidiary is not in material compliance with any of the statutes,
regulations or ordinances which such Bank Regulator enforces; (ii)
threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental
authorization which is material to HNC or any HNC Subsidiary; (iii) requiring,
or threatening to require, HNC or any HNC Subsidiary, or indicating 

 

    ##### 

  

   

that HNC or any HNC Subsidiary may be required, to enter into a cease and
desist order, agreement or memorandum of understanding or any other agreement
with any federal or state governmental agency or authority which is charged
with the supervision or regulation of banks or engages in the insurance of
bank deposits restricting or limiting, or purporting to restrict or limit, in
any material respect the operations of HNC or any HNC Subsidiary, including
without limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends; or (iv)
directing, restricting or limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or
limit, in any manner the operations of HNC or any HNC Subsidiary, including
without limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends (any
such notice, communication, memorandum, agreement or order described in this
sentence is hereinafter referred to as a "HNC Regulatory Agreement"). Neither
HNC nor any HNC Subsidiary has consented to or entered into any HNC
Regulatory Agreement that is currently in effect or that was in effect since
January 1, 2008. The most recent regulatory rating given to HNB as to
compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") is satisfactory or
better. 

  

4.12.4. Since January 1, 2007, HNC has been and is in compliance in all
material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and
regulations of the Nasdaq. HNC Disclosure Schedule 4.12.4 sets forth, as of
December 31, 2008, a schedule of all executive officers and directors of HNC
who have outstanding loans from HNC or HNB, and there has been no default on,
or forgiveness or waiver of, in whole or in part, any such loan during the
two years immediately preceding the date hereof. 

  

4.13. _Employee Benefit Plans._  

  

4.13.1. HNC Disclosure Schedule 4.13.1 includes a list of all existing bonus,
incentive, deferred compensation, supplemental executive retirement plans,
pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock
ownership, stock bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option, stock
appreciation, phantom stock, severance, welfare benefit plans (including paid
time off policies and other material benefit policies and procedures), fringe
benefit plans, employment, consulting, settlement and change in control
agreements and all other material benefit practices, policies and
arrangements maintained by HNC or any HNC Subsidiary in which any employee or
former employee, consultant or former consultant or director or former
director of HNC or any HNC Subsidiary participates or to which any such
employee, consultant or director is a party or is otherwise entitled to
receive benefits (the "HNC Compensation and Benefit Plans"). Neither HNC
nor any HNC Subsidiary has any commitment to create any additional HNC
Compensation and Benefit Plan or to materially modify, change or renew any
existing HNC Compensation and Benefit Plan (any modification or change that
increases the cost of such plans would be deemed material), except
as required to maintain the qualified status thereof, HNC has made available
to FNFG true and correct copies of the HNC Compensation and Benefit Plans. 

  

4.13.2. To the Knowledge of HNC, HNB and HMS and except as disclosed in HNC
Disclosure Schedule 4.13.2, each HNC Compensation and Benefit Plan has been
operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its
terms and with applicable law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the
Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act, COBRA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act ("HIPAA") and any regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all
material filings, 

 

    ##### 

  

   

disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA and HIPAA and
any other applicable law have been timely made or any interest, fines,
penalties or other impositions for late filings have been paid in full. Each
HNC Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and which is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS, and HNC is not aware of any
circumstances which are reasonably likely to result in revocation of any
such favorable determination letter. There is no material pending or, to the
Knowledge of HNC, HNB and HMS, threatened action, suit or claim relating to
any of the HNC Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for
benefits). Neither HNC nor any HNC Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction,
or omitted to take any action, with respect to any HNC Compensation and
Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject HNC or any HNC
Subsidiary to a material unpaid tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975
of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA. 

  

4.13.3. No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by HNC or any
HNC Subsidiary with respect to any HNC Compensation and Benefit Plan which is
subject to Title IV of ERISA ("HNC Pension Plan") currently or formerly
maintained by HNC or any entity which is considered one employer with HNC
under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "HNC
ERISA Affiliate") since the effective date of ERISA that has not been
satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a material risk to
HNC or any HNC ERISA Affiliate of incurring a liability under such Title. No
HNC Pension Plan had an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined
in Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the
end of the most recent plan year ending prior to the date hereof; the fair
market value of the assets of each HNC Pension Plan exceeds the present value
of the "benefit liabilities" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of
ERISA) under such HNC Pension Plan as of the end of the most recent plan year
with respect to the respective HNC Pension Plan ending prior to the date
hereof, calculated on the basis of the actuarial assumptions used in the most
recent actuarial valuation for such HNC Pension Plan as of the date hereof;
there is not currently pending with the PBGC any filing with respect to
any reportable event under Section 4043 of ERISA nor has any reportable event
occurred as to which a filing is required and has not been made (other than
as might be required with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby). Neither HNC nor any HNC ERISA Affiliate
has contributed to any "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA. Neither HNC, nor any HNC ERISA Affiliate, nor any HNC Compensation and
Benefit Plan, including any HNC Pension Plan, nor any trust created
thereunder, nor any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in
a transaction in connection with which HNC, any HNC ERISA Affiliate, and any
HNC Compensation and Benefit Plan, including any HNC Pension Plan or any such
trust or any trustee or administrator thereof, could reasonably be expected
to be subject to either a civil liability or penalty pursuant to Section 409,
502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to Chapter 43 of the

Concern (including, but not limited to, responsibility (or potential

any HNC Subsidiary; 

 

    #####

order, directive, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the HNC Â‘s
Knowledge, threatened, before any court, governmental agency or other forum

any predecessor) with, or liability under, any Environmental Law or (y)
relating to the presence of or release (defined herein) into the environment
of any Materials of Environmental Concern (as defined herein), whether or not
occurring at or on a site owned, leased or operated by HNC or any HNC
Subsidiary; 

  

(C) To HNCÂ’s Knowledge, there are no underground storage tanks on, in or under
any properties owned or operated by HNC or any of the HNC Subsidiaries, and
to HNCÂ’s Knowledge, no underground storage tanks have been closed or removed
from any properties owned or operated by HNC or any of the HNC Subsidiaries
or any Participation Facility except in compliance with Environmental Laws
in all material respects; and

has notified HNB or any other HNC Subsidiary during the past twelve months
of, or has asserted against HNB or any other HNC Subsidiary, in each case in
writing, any "lender liability" or similar claim, and, to the Knowledge of
HNB, each borrower, customer or other party which has given HNB or any other
HNC Subsidiary any oral notification of, or orally asserted to or against HNB
or any other HNC Subsidiary, any such claim; (D) all loans, (1) that are
contractually past due 90 days or more in the payment of principal and/or
interest, (2) that are on non-accrual status, (3) that as of the date of this
Agreement are classified as "Other Loans Specially Mentioned", "Special

identity of the obligor thereunder, (4) where, during the past three years,
the interest rate terms have been reduced and/or the maturity dates have

connection therewith, and (E) all assets classified by HNB or any HNB

armÂ’s-length transactions, were made for good and valuable consideration in
the ordinary course of HNCÂ’s or the appropriate HNC SubsidiaryÂ’s respective
business, and the notes or other evidences of indebtedness with respect to
such loans (including discounts) are true and genuine and are what they
purport to be. To the Knowledge of HNC, the loans, discounts and the accrued
interest reflected on the books of HNC and the HNC Subsidiaries are subject
to no defenses, set-offs or counterclaims (including, without
limitation, those afforded by usury or truth-in-lending laws), except as may
be provided by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditorsÂ’
rights generally or by general principles of equity. All such loans are owned
by HNC or the appropriate HNC Subsidiary free and clear of any liens.
Disclosure Schedule 4.16.3 may exclude any individual loan with a principal
outstanding balance of less than $50,000. 

  

4.16.4. The notes and other evidences of indebtedness evidencing the loans
described above, and all pledges, mortgages, deeds of trust and other
collateral documents or security instruments relating thereto are, in all
material respects, valid, true and genuine, and what they purport to be. 

  

4.17. _Securities Documents._  

  

HNC has made available to FNFG copies of its (i) annual reports on Form 10-K
for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, (ii) quarterly reports

used or for use in connection with its meetings of shareholders held in 2009,
2008 and 2007. Such reports, prospectus and proxy materials complied, as to
form, at the time filed with the SEC, in all material respects, with the

been provided to FNFG), or as set forth in HNC Disclosure Schedule 4.18,
neither HNC nor any HNC Subsidiary is a party to any transaction (including
any loan or other credit accommodation) with any Affiliate of HNC or any HNC
Affiliate. All such transactions (a) were made in the ordinary course of
business, (b) were made on substantially the same terms, including interest
rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions with other Persons, and (c) did not involve substantially
more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable
features (as such terms are used under Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act). No loan or credit
accommodation to any Affiliate of HNC or any HNC Subsidiary is presently
in default or, during the three year period prior to the date of this
Agreement, has been in default or has been restructured, modified or
extended. To the Knowledge of HNC, neither HNC nor any HNC Subsidiary has
been notified that principal and interest with respect to any such loan or
other credit accommodation will not be paid when due

Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of FNFG set forth
in Section 5.18, the Board of Directors of HNC, to the extent such statute is
applicable, taken all action (including appropriate approvals of the Board of
Directors of HNC) necessary to exempt FNFG, the Merger, the Merger Agreement

PBCL. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of FNFG set
forth in Section 5.18, the affirmative vote of a majority of the issued and
outstanding shares of HNC Common Stock is required to approve this Agreement
and the Merger under HNCÂ’s certificate of incorporation and the PBCL. HNC

the PBCL. 

  

4.21. _Registration Obligations._

entered into for HNCÂ’s own account, or for the account of one or more of
HNCÂ’s Subsidiaries or their customers (all of which are set forth in HNC
Disclosure Schedule 4.22), were in all material respects entered into
in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory
policies, and to the Knowledge of HNC, with counterparties believed to be
financially responsible at the time; and to HNCÂ’s Knowledge each of them
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of HNC or one of its
Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’ rights or by general
equity principles), and is in full force and effect. Neither HNC nor any HNC
Subsidiary, nor to the Knowledge of HNC any other party thereto, is in breach
of any of its obligations under any such agreement or arrangement in any
material respect. 

  

4.23. _Fairness Opinion._  

  

HNC has received a written opinion from JP Morgan to the effect that, subject
to the terms, conditions and qualifications set forth therein, as of the date
hereof, the Exchange Ratio (assuming that the level of HNC Delinquent Loans
will not result in any adjustment) to be received by the shareholders of HNC
pursuant to this Agreement is fair to such shareholders 

 

    ##### 

  

   

from a financial point of view. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded
as of the date of this Agreement.

fiduciary account.

service marks and trademarks, which are material to the conduct of their
business as currently conducted, each without payment, except for all
license agreements under which license fees or other payments are due in the
ordinary course of HNCÂ’s or each of HNCÂ’s SubsidiariesÂ’ business, and neither
HNC nor any HNC Subsidiary has received any notice of conflict with respect
thereto that asserts the rights of others. HNC and each HNC Subsidiary has
performed all the material obligations required to be performed, and are not
in default in any respect, under any contract, agreement, arrangement or
commitment relating to any of the foregoing. To the Knowledge of HNC, the
conduct of the business of HNC and each HNC Subsidiary as currently conducted
or proposed to be conducted does not, in any material respect, infringe upon,
dilute, misappropriate or otherwise violate any intellectual property owned or
controlled by any third party. 

  

4.26. _Labor Matters._  

  

There are no labor or collective bargaining agreements to which HNC or any HNC
Subsidiary is a party. To the Knowledge of HNC, there is no union organizing
effort pending or to the Knowledge of HNC, threatened against HNC or any HNC

HNC or any HNC Subsidiary. There is no unfair labor practice or labor
arbitration proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of HNC, threatened
against HNC or any HNC Subsidiary (other than routine employee grievances that
are not related to union employees). HNC and each HNC Subsidiary is in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws respecting
employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and
wages and hours, and are not engaged in any unfair labor practice.

The information relating to HNC and any HNC Subsidiary to be contained in the
Merger Registration Statement, or in any other document filed with any Bank
Regulator or other Governmental Entity in connection herewith, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material 

 

    ##### 

  

   

fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not
misleading.

Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of FNFG or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described below
in this Section 5.6.3. FNFG (x) has implemented and maintains a system
of internal control over financial reporting (as required by Rule 13a-15(a)
of the Exchange Act) that is designed to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, (y)
has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to FNFG, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to
the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of FNFG by others
within those entities, and (z) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to FNFGÂ’s outside auditors and the audit
committee of FNFGÂ’s Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect FNFGÂ’s ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in FNFGÂ’s internal control over financial reporting. As of the date
hereof, to the knowledge of FNFG, its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will be able to give the certifications required pursuant
to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due. 

  

5.6.4. The allowance for credit losses reflected in FNFGÂ’s audited statement
of condition at December 31, 2008 was, and the allowance for credit losses
shown on the balance sheets in FNFGÂ’s Securities Documents for periods ending
after December 31, 2008 will be, adequate, as of the dates thereof, under
GAAP. 

  

5.7. _Taxes._  

  

FNFG and the FNFG Subsidiaries are members of the same affiliated group within
the meaning of Code Section 1504(a). FNFG and each FNFG Subsidiary has duly
filed all federal, state and material local tax returns required to be filed
by or with respect to FNFG and each FNFG Subsidiary on or prior to the
Closing Date, taking into account any extensions (all such returns, to the
Knowledge of FNFG, being accurate and correct in all material respects) and
has duly paid or made provisions for the payment of all material federal,
state and local taxes which have been incurred by or are due or claimed to be
due from FNFG and any FNFG Subsidiary by any taxing authority or pursuant
to any written tax sharing agreement on or prior to the Closing Date other
than taxes or other charges which (i) are not delinquent, (ii) are being
contested in 

 

    ##### 

  

   

good faith, or (iii) have not yet been fully determined. As of the date of
this Agreement, FNFG has received no written notice of, and to FNFGÂ’s
Knowledge there is no audit examination, deficiency assessment, tax
investigation or refund litigation with respect to any taxes of FNFG or any
FNFG Subsidiary, and no written claim has been made by any authority in a
jurisdiction where FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary does not file tax returns that
FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. FNFG
and the FNFG Subsidiaries have not executed an extension or waiver of any
statute of limitations on the assessment or collection of any material tax due
that is currently in effect. FNFG and each FNFG Subsidiary has withheld and
paid all taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,
shareholder or other third party, and FNFG and each FNFG Subsidiary, to
the Knowledge of FNFG, has timely complied with all applicable information
reporting requirements under Part III, Subchapter A of Chapter 61 of the Code
and similar applicable state and local information reporting requirements. 

  

5.8. _No Material Adverse Effect._  

  

FNFG has not suffered any Material Adverse Effect since March 31, 2009 and no
event has occurred or circumstance arisen since that date which, in the
aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
on FNFG. 

  

5.9. _Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage._  

  

5.9.1. FNFG and each FNFG Subsidiary has good and, as to real property,
marketable title to all material assets and properties owned by FNFG or each
FNFG Subsidiary in the conduct of their businesses, whether such assets and
properties are real or personal, tangible or intangible, including assets and
property reflected in the balance sheets contained in the FNFG
Financial Statements or acquired subsequent thereto (except to the extent
that such assets and properties have been disposed of in the ordinary course
of business, since the date of such balance sheets), subject to no material
encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests or pledges, except
(i) those items which secure liabilities for public or statutory obligations
or any discount with, borrowing from or other obligations to FHLB, inter-bank
credit facilities, or any transaction by a FNFG Subsidiary acting in a
fiduciary capacity, (ii) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or
which are being contested in good faith, (iii) non-monetary liens affecting
real property which do not adversely affect the value or use of such real
property, and (iv) those described and reflected in the FNFG Financial
Statements. FNFG and the FNFG Subsidiaries, as lessee, have the right under
valid and enforceable leases of real and personal properties used by FNFG and
its Subsidiaries in the conduct of their businesses to occupy or use all such
properties as presently occupied and used by each of them. To FNFGÂ’s
knowledge, neither FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary is in default in any material
respect under any lease for any real or personal property to which
either FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary is a party, and there has not occurred any
event that, with lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would
constitute such default, except for such defaults which, either individually
or in the aggregate, will not have a Material Adverse Effect on FNFG. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

5.10. _Legal Proceedings._  

  

Except as disclosed in FNFG Disclosure Schedule 5.10, neither FNFG nor any
FNFG Subsidiary is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of FNFG, threatened legal, administrative, arbitration or other
proceedings, claims (whether asserted or unasserted), actions or governmental
investigations or inquiries of any nature (i) against FNFG or any FNFG
Subsidiary, (ii) to which FNFG or any FNFG SubsidiaryÂ’s assets are or may be
subject, (iii) challenging the validity or propriety of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) which would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the ability of FNFG to perform under
this Agreement, except for any proceeding, claim, action, investigation or
inquiry which, if adversely determined, individually or in the aggregate,
would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

5.11. _Compliance With Applicable Law._  

  

5.11.1. To the Knowledge of FNFG, each of FNFG and each FNFG Subsidiary is in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state, local
and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders
or decrees applicable to it, its properties, assets and deposits, its
business, and its conduct of business and its relationship with
its employees, including, without limitation, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act
of 1977, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and all other applicable fair
lending laws and other laws relating to discriminatory business practices,
and neither FNFG nor any FNFG Subsidiary has received any written notice to
the contrary. The Board of Directors of First Niagara Bank has adopted and
First Niagara Bank has implemented an anti-money laundering program that
contains adequate and appropriate customer identification verification
procedures that has not been deemed ineffective by any Governmental Entity
and that meets the requirements of Sections 352 and 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act
and the regulations thereunder. 

  

5.11.2. Each of FNFG and each FNFG Subsidiary has all material permits,
licenses, authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all filings,
applications and registrations with, all Bank Regulators that are required in
order to permit it to own or lease its properties and to conduct its business
as presently conducted; all such permits, licenses, certificates
of authority, orders and approvals are in full force and effect and, to the
Knowledge of FNFG, no suspension or cancellation of any such permit, license,
certificate, order or approval is threatened or will result from the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to
obtaining the Regulatory Approvals. 

  

5.11.3. For the period beginning January 1, 2008, neither FNFG nor any FNFG
Subsidiary has received any written notification or, to the Knowledge of
FNFG, any other communication from any Bank Regulator (i) asserting that FNFG
or any FNFG Subsidiary is not in material compliance with any of the
statutes, regulations or ordinances which such Bank Regulator enforces; (ii)
threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental
authorization which is material to FNFG or First Niagara Bank or First
Niagara Commercial Bank; (iii) requiring or threatening to require FNFG or
any FNFG Subsidiary, or indicating that FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary may be
required, to enter into a cease and desist order, agreement or memorandum of
understanding or any other agreement with any federal or state governmental 

 

    ##### 

  

   

agency or authority which is charged with the supervision or regulation of
banks or engages in the insurance of bank deposits restricting or limiting,
or purporting to restrict or limit, in any material respect the operations of
FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary, including without limitation any restriction on
the payment of dividends; or (iv) directing, restricting or limiting, or
purporting to direct, restrict or limit, in any manner the operations of FNFG
or any FNFG Subsidiary, including without limitation any restriction on the
payment of dividends (any such notice, communication, memorandum, agreement
or order described in this sentence is hereinafter referred to as an "FNFG
Regulatory Agreement"). Neither FNFG nor any FNFG Subsidiary has consented to
or entered into any currently effective FNFG Regulatory Agreement. The most
recent regulatory rating given to First Niagara Bank as to compliance with
the CRA is satisfactory or better. 

  

5.11.4. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, FNFG has been and is in
compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance
rules and regulations of the Nasdaq. 

  

5.12. _Employee Benefit Plans._  

  

5.12.1. FNFG Disclosure Schedule 5.12.1 includes a list of all existing bonus,
incentive, deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit-sharing,
employee stock ownership, restricted stock, stock option, stock appreciation,
phantom stock, severance, welfare benefit, and fringe benefit plans and all
other benefit practices, policies and arrangements maintained by FNFG or
any FNFG Subsidiary and in which employees in general may participate (the
"FNFG Compensation and Benefit Plans"). 

  

5.12.2. To the Knowledge of FNFG, each FNFG Compensation and Benefit Plan has
been operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with
its terms and with applicable law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the
Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act, COBRA, HIPAA, and any regulations or rules
promulgated thereunder, and all material filings, disclosures and notices
required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA, and HIPAA and any other applicable
law have been timely made or any interest, fines, penalties or
other impositions for late filings have been paid in full. Each FNFG
Compensation and Benefit Plan which is a Pension Plan and which is intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS, and FNFG is not aware of any
circumstances which are reasonably likely to result in revocation of any such
favorable determination letter. There is no material pending or, to the
Knowledge of FNFG, threatened action, suit or claim relating to any of the
FNFG Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for benefits).
Neither FNFG nor any FNFG Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction, or omitted
to take any action, with respect to any FNFG Compensation and Benefit Plan
that would reasonably be expected to subject FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary to a
material unpaid tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502 of ERISA. 

  

5.12.3. No liability to any Governmental Entity, other than PBGC premiums
arising in the ordinary course of business, has been or is expected by FNFG
or any FNFG Subsidiary with respect to any FNFG Compensation and Benefit Plan
which is subject to Title IV of ERISA ("FNFG Pension Plan") currently or
formerly maintained by FNFG or any entity which is considered one employer
with FNFG under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414 of the 

 

    ##### 

  

   

Code (an "FNFG ERISA Affiliate"). No FNFG Defined Benefit Plan had an
"accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 431 of the Code),
whether or not waived, as of the last day of the end of the most recent plan
year ending prior to the date hereof. The fair market value of the assets of
each FNFG Defined Benefit Plan exceeds the present value of the benefits
guaranteed under Section 4022 of ERISA under such FNFG Defined Benefit Plan
as of the end of the most recent plan year with respect to the respective
FNFG Defined Benefit Plan ending prior to the date hereof, calculated on the
basis of the actuarial assumptions used in the most recent actuarial
valuation for such FNFG Defined Benefit Plan as of the date hereof; and no
notice of a "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for
which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived has been required
to be filed for any FNFG Defined Benefit Plan within the 12-month period
ending on the date hereof. Neither FNFG nor any of its Subsidiaries has
provided, or is required to provide, security to any FNFG Defined Benefit
Plan or has taken any action, or omitted to take any action, that has
resulted, or would reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of a
lien under Section 412(n) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA. Neither FNFG nor
any FNFG Subsidiary nor any FNFG ERISA Affiliate has contributed to any
"multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, on or after
January 1, 1998. 

  

5.12.4. All material contributions required to be made under the terms of any
FNFG Compensation and Benefit Plan have been timely made, and all anticipated
contributions and funding obligations are accrued on FNFGÂ’s consolidated
financial statements to the extent required by GAAP. FNFG and its
Subsidiaries have expensed and accrued as a liability the present value of
future benefits under each applicable FNFG Compensation and Benefit Plan for
financial reporting purposes as required by GAAP. 

  

5.13. _Environmental Matters._  

  

5.13.1. To the Knowledge of FNFG, neither the conduct nor operation of its
business nor any condition of any property currently or previously owned or
operated by it (including, without limitation, in a fiduciary or agency
capacity), or on which it holds a lien, results or resulted in a violation of
any Environmental Laws that is reasonably likely to impose a material
liability (including a material remediation obligation) upon FNFG or any FNFG
Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of FNFG, no condition has existed or event has
occurred with respect to any of them or any such property that, with notice
or the passage of time, or both, is reasonably likely to result in
any material liability to FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary by reason of any
Environmental Laws. Neither FNFG nor any FNFG Subsidiary during the past five
years has received any written notice from any Person or Governmental Entity
that FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary or the operation or condition of
any property ever owned, operated, or held as collateral or in a fiduciary
capacity by any of them are currently in violation of or otherwise are
alleged to have liability under any Environmental Laws or relating to
Materials of Environmental Concern (including, but not limited to,
responsibility (or potential responsibility) for the cleanup or other
remediation of any Materials of Environmental Concern at, on, beneath, or
originating from any such property) for which a material liability is
reasonably likely to be imposed upon FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary. 

  

5.13.2. There is no suit, claim, action, demand, executive or administrative
order, directive, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the FNFG Â‘s
Knowledge, threatened, before 

 

    ##### 

  

   

any court, governmental agency or other forum against FNFG or any FNFG
Subsidiary (x) for alleged noncompliance (including by any predecessor) with,
or liability under, any Environmental Law or (y) relating to the presence of
or release (defined herein) into the environment of any Materials of
Environmental Concern (as defined herein), whether or not occurring at or on a
site owned, leased or operated by FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary. 

  

5.14. _Securities Documents_  

  

5.14.1 FNFG has made available to HNC copies of its (i) annual reports on Form
10-K for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, (ii) quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31 and June 30, 2008, and
(iii) proxy materials used or for use in connection with its meetings of
shareholders held in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Such reports and such proxy
materials complied, at the time filed with the SEC, in all material respects,
with the Securities Laws. 

  

5.14.2 In FNFGÂ’s reasonable judgment, the allowance for loan losses reflected
in FNFGÂ’s audited consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008 was, and
the allowance for loan losses shown on the balance sheet in FNFGÂ’s Securities
Documents at March 31, 2009 was adequate in all material respects, as of the
date thereof, under GAAP. 

  

5.15. _Brokers, Finders and Financial Advisors_  

  

Neither FNFG nor any FNFG Subsidiary, nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents, has employed any broker, finder or financial
advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or incurred any liability or commitment for any fees or commissions to any
such person in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement except for the retention of Keefe Bruyette and Woods and Sandler
OÂ’Neill and Partners, L.P. and the fee payable pursuant thereto. 

  

5.16. _FNFG Common Stock_  

  

The shares of FNFG Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement, when
issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and subject to no
preemptive rights. 

  

5.17. _FNFG Information Supplied_  

  

The information relating to FNFG and any FNFG Subsidiary to be contained in
the Merger Registration Statement, or in any other document filed with any
Bank Regulator or other Governmental Entity in connection herewith, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they are made, not misleading. The Merger Registration Statement
will comply with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and the provisions of the Securities Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made
by FNFG with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
based on information supplied by HNC specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Merger Registration Statement. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

5.18. _PBCL Sections 2538 and 2553_ 

  

Other than by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, FNFG is not an "interested shareholder" (as defined in Sections 2538
or 2553 of the PBCL) of HNC.

months from the date hereof; 

  

(W) pay, discharge, settle or compromise any claim, action, litigation,
arbitration or proceeding, other than any such payment, discharge, settlement
or compromise in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice that involves solely money damages in the amount not in excess of
$25,000 individually or $50,000 in the aggregate, and that does not create
negative precedent for other pending or potential claims, actions,

withheld), except as required by law or for communications in the ordinary

Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby; or 

  

(AA) agree to do any of the foregoing. 

  

6.1.3. _Stock Purchase Plan_. 

  

HNC agrees to continue the suspension of the HNC Dividend Reinvestment and
Stock Purchase Plan ("Stock Purchase Plan"). HNC further agrees that as soon
as practicable following the date of this Agreement, but in no event later
than the Effective Time, HNC shall terminate the Stock Purchase Plan. 

  

6.2. _Current Information._  

  

6.2.1. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, HNC will cause one or more of its representatives to confer with
representatives of FNFG and report the general status of its ongoing
operations at such times as FNFG may reasonably request. HNC will
promptly notify FNFG of any material change in the normal course of its
business or in the operation of its properties and, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, of any governmental complaints, investigations or hearings
(or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated), or
the institution or the threat of material litigation involving HNC or any HNC
Subsidiary. Without limiting the foregoing, senior officers of FNFG and HNC
shall meet on a reasonably regular basis (expected to be at least monthly) to
review the financial and operational affairs of HNC and its Subsidiaries, in
accordance with applicable law, and HNC shall give due consideration to
FNFGÂ’s input on such matters, with the understanding that, notwithstanding
any other provision contained in this Agreement, neither FNFG nor any FNFG
Subsidiary shall under any circumstance be permitted to exercise control of
HNC or any HNC Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time. 

  

6.2.2. HNB and First Niagara Bank shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and
plan for the conversion of HNBÂ’s data processing and related electronic
informational systems to those used by First Niagara Bank, which planning
shall include, but not be limited to, discussion of the possible termination
by HNB of third-party service provider arrangements effective at the Effective
Time or at a date thereafter, non-renewal of personal property leases and
software licenses used by HNB in connection with its systems operations,
retention of outside consultants and additional employees to assist with the
conversion, and outsourcing, as appropriate, of proprietary or self-
provided system services, it being understood that HNB shall not be obligated
to take any such action prior to the Effective Time and, unless HNB otherwise
agrees, no 

 

    ##### 

  

   

conversion shall take place prior to the Effective Time. In the event that HNB
takes, at the request of First Niagara Bank, any action relative to third
parties to facilitate the conversion that results in the imposition of any
termination fees or charges, First Niagara Bank shall indemnify HNB for any
such fees and charges, and the costs of reversing the conversion process,
if for any reason the Merger is not consummated for any reason other than a
breach of this Agreement by HNC, or a termination of this Agreement under
Section 11.1.8 or 11.1.9. 

  

6.2.3. HNB shall provide First Niagara Bank, within fifteen (15) business days
of the end of each calendar month, a written list of nonperforming assets
(the term "nonperforming assets," for purposes of this subsection, means (i)
loans that are "troubled debt restructuring" as defined in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 15, "Accounting by Debtors and Creditors
for Troubled Debt Restructuring," (ii) loans on nonaccrual, (iii) real estate
owned, (iv) all loans ninety (90) days or more past due) as of the end of
such month and (iv) and impaired loans. On a monthly basis, HNC shall provide
First Niagara Bank with a schedule of all loan approvals, which schedule
shall indicate the loan amount, loan type and other material features of the
loan. 

  

6.2.4. HNC shall promptly inform FNFG upon receiving notice of any legal,
administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, demands, notices, audits or
investigations (by any federal, state or local commission, agency or board)
relating to the alleged liability of HNC or any HNC Subsidiary under any
labor or employment law. 

  

6.3. _Access to Properties and Records._  

  

Subject to Section 12.1 hereof, HNC shall permit FNFG reasonable access during
normal business hours upon reasonable notice to its properties and those of
the HNC Subsidiaries, and shall disclose and make available to FNFG during
normal business hours all of its books, papers and records relating to the
assets, properties, operations, obligations and liabilities, including,
but not limited to, all books of account (including the general ledger), tax
records, minute books of directorsÂ’ (other than minutes that discuss any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other subject matter
HNC reasonably determines should be treated as confidential)
and shareholdersÂ’ meetings, organizational documents, Bylaws, material
contracts and agreements, filings with any regulatory authority, litigation
files, plans affecting employees, and any other business activities or
prospects in which FNFG may have a reasonable interest; provided,
however, that HNC shall not be required to take any action that would provide
access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
violate or prejudice the rights or business interests or confidences of any
customer or other person or would result in the waiver by it of the privilege
protecting communications between it and any of its counsel. HNC shall provide
and shall request its auditors to provide FNFG with such historical financial
information regarding it (and related audit reports and consents) as FNFG may
reasonably request for securities disclosure purposes. FNFG shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with
HNCÂ’s regular business operations during any such access to HNCÂ’s property,
books and records. HNC shall permit FNFG, at its expense, to cause a "phase I
environmental audit" and a "phase II environmental audit" to be performed at
each Branch at any time prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that FNFG shall have the right to conduct a "phase II environmental audit"
prior to the Closing only to the extent that a "phase II environmental audit"
is within the scope of additional testing recommended by the "phase I 

 

    ##### 

  

   

environmental audit" to be performed as a result of a "Recognized
Environmental Condition" (as such term is defined by The American Society for
Testing Materials) that was discovered in the "phase I environmental audit"
and provided that as to any "phase II environmental audits" performed at
a Branch which HNB leases, the landlord pursuant to the applicable lease has
consented to such "phase II environmental audit" if such consent is necessary
pursuant to the lease. HNB will use its commercially reasonable efforts (at
no cost to HNB) to obtain such landlord consent. Prior to performing any
"phase II environmental audits," FNFG will provide HNC with a copy of its
proposed work plan and FNFG will cooperate in good faith with HNC to address
any comments or suggestions made by HNC regarding the work plan. FNFG and its
environmental consultant shall conduct all environmental assessments pursuant
to this Section at mutually agreeable times and so as to eliminate or
minimize to the greatest extent possible interference with HNCÂ’s operation of
its business, and FNFG shall maintain or cause to be maintained reasonably
adequate insurance with respect to any assessment conducted hereunder. FNFG
shall be required to restore each Owned Real Property to substantially its
pre-assessment condition. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with
any "phase I environmental audit" and any "phase II environmental audit," and
any restoration and clean up, shall be borne solely by FNFG. 

  

6.4. _Financial and Other Statements._  

  

6.4.1. Promptly upon receipt thereof, HNC will furnish to FNFG copies of each
annual, interim or special audit of the books of HNC and the HNC Subsidiaries
made by its independent auditors and copies of all internal control reports
submitted to HNC by such auditors in connection with each annual, interim or
special audit of the books of HNC and the HNC Subsidiaries made by
such auditors. 

  

6.4.2. As soon as reasonably available, but in no event later than the date
such documents are filed with the SEC, HNC will deliver to FNFG the
Securities Documents filed by it with the SEC under the Securities Laws. HNC
will furnish to FNFG copies of all documents, statements and reports as it or
any HNC Subsidiary shall send to its shareholders, the FDIC, the FRB,
the Department or any other regulatory authority, except as legally
prohibited thereby. Within 25 days after the end of each month, HNC will
deliver to FNFG a consolidated balance sheet and a consolidated statement of
income, without related notes, for such month prepared in accordance
with current financial reporting practices. 

  

6.4.3. HNC will advise FNFG promptly of the receipt of any examination report
of any Bank Regulator with respect to the condition or activities of HNC or
any of the HNC Subsidiaries. 

  

6.4.4. With reasonable promptness, HNC will furnish to FNFG such additional
financial data that HNC possesses and as FNFG may reasonably request,
including without limitation, detailed monthly financial statements and loan
reports. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

6.5. _Maintenance of Insurance._  

  

HNC shall maintain, and cause each HNC Subsidiary to maintain, insurance in
such amounts as are reasonable to cover such risks as are customary in
relation to the character and location of their properties and the nature of
their business. 

  

6.6. _Disclosure Supplements._  

  

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, HNC will promptly supplement or
amend the HNC Disclosure Schedule delivered in connection herewith with
respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or
known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth
or described in such HNC Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to correct
any information in such HNC Disclosure Schedule which has been rendered
materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such HNC
Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect for the purpose of determining
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX. 

  

6.7. _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties._  

  

HNC shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as soon as
practicable all consents and approvals necessary or desirable for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

6.8. _Reasonable Best Efforts._  

  

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, HNC agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

6.9. _Failure to Fulfill Conditions._  

  

In the event that HNC determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that
condition, it will promptly notify FNFG. 

  

6.10. _No Solicitation._  

  

(a) HNC shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the respective
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants, consultants, affiliates and other agents
(collectively, the "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly,
(i) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to
facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any Person
(other than FNFG) any information or data with respect to HNC or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) release
any Person from, waive any provisions of, or fail to enforce
any confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which HNC is a
party; or (iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of
intent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal 

 

    ##### 

  

   

or approve or resolve to approve any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement,
agreement in principle or letter of intent relating to an Acquisition
Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by HNC or any
Representative, whether or not such Representative is so authorized
and whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of HNC
or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by HNC. HNC
and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause each of HNC Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all
existing discussions, negotiations, and communications with any Persons with
respect to any existing or potential Acquisition Proposal. 

  

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry,
offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from FNFG),
whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction. For purposes
of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (A) any transaction
or series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving HNC or any of its Subsidiaries; (B) any transaction
pursuant to which any third party or group acquires or would acquire
(whether through sale, lease or other disposition), directly or indirectly,
any assets of HNC or any of its Subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate,
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the assets of HNC and its Subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis; (C) any issuance, sale or other disposition
of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar
transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase or
securities convertible into, such securities) representing twenty-five
percent (25%) or more of the votes attached to the outstanding securities of
HNC or any of its Subsidiaries; (D) any tender offer or exchange offer that,
if consummated, would result in any third party or group beneficially owning
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class of equity securities of HNC or
any of its Subsidiaries; or (E) any transaction which is similar in form,
substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, or any combination
of the foregoing. 

  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.10(a), HNC may take any of the actions described
in clause (ii) of Section 6.10(a) if, but only if, (i) HNC has received a
bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach of this Section 6.10; (ii) HNC Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with and having considered the advice of its outside legal
counsel and its independent financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and; (iii)
HNC has provided FNFG with at least one (1) Business DayÂ’s prior notice of
such determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or affording access to any
information or data with respect to HNC or any of its Subsidiaries
or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, HNC receives from such
Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to HNC than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. HNC shall promptly provide
to FNFG any non-public information regarding HNC or its Subsidiaries provided
to any other Person that was not previously provided to FNFG, such
additional information to be provided no later than the date of provision of
such information to such other party. 

  

For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended
or modified) made by a third party to enter into an Acquisition Transaction
on terms that HNC Board determines in its 

 

    ##### 

  

   

good faith judgment, after consultation with and having considered the advice
of outside legal counsel and a financial advisor (i) would, if consummated,
result in the acquisition of all, but not less than all, of the issued and
outstanding shares of HNC Common Stock or all, or substantially all, of the
assets of HNC and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (ii) would result
in a transaction that (A) involves consideration to the holders of the shares
of HNC Common Stock that is more favorable, from a financial point of view,
than the consideration to be paid to HNCÂ’s shareholders pursuant to this
Agreement, considering, among other things, the nature of the consideration
being offered and any material regulatory approvals or other risks associated
with the timing of the proposed transaction beyond or in addition to those
specifically contemplated hereby, and which proposal is not conditioned upon
obtaining additional financing and (B) is, in light of the other terms of
such proposal, more favorable to HNCÂ’s shareholders than the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) is reasonably likely to
be completed on the terms proposed, in each case taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal. 

  

(c) HNC shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify
FNFG in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any information
is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be
initiated or continued with, HNC or any HNC Representatives, in each case in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the
name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or making such
proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and conditions
of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials relating to
such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussion,
providing copies of such materials (including e-mails or other
electronic communications) unless (i) such materials constitute confidential
information of the party making such offer or proposal under an effective
confidentiality agreement, (ii) disclosure of such materials jeopardizes the
attorney-client privilege or (iii) disclosure of such materials contravenes
any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree. HNC agrees that it shall
keep FNFG informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such
proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussions (including
any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer or request). 

  

(d) Neither the HNC Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
qualify or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to FNFG in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger), the HNC Recommendation (as defined in
Section 8.1), or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with
HNC Shareholders Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the HNC
Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral position or no
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an
adverse modification of the HNC Recommendation); (ii) approve or recommend,
or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or
(iii) enter into (or cause HNC or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into) any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
agreement (A) related to any Acquisition Transaction (other than
a confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with the provisions of
Section 6.10(b)) or (B) requiring HNC to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding Section 6.10(d), prior to the date of HNC Shareholders
Meeting, the HNC Board may approve or recommend to the shareholders of HNC a
Superior Proposal and withdraw, qualify or modify HNC Recommendation in
connection therewith (a "HNC Subsequent Determination") after the third (3rd)
Business Day following FNFGÂ’s receipt of a notice (the "Notice of
Superior Proposal") from HNC advising FNFG that the HNC Board has decided
that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it received
(that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.10) constitutes a
Superior Proposal (it being understood that HNC shall be required to deliver
a new Notice of Superior Proposal in respect of any revised Superior Proposal
from such third party or its affiliates that HNC proposes to accept and the
subsequent notice period shall be two (2) business days) if, but only if, (i)
the HNC Board has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation
with and having considered the advice of outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor, that the failure to take such actions would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to HNCÂ’s shareholders
under applicable law, and (ii) at the end of such three (3) Business Day
period, after taking into account any such adjusted, modified or amended terms
as may have been committed to in writing by FNFG since its receipt of such
Notice of Superior Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that FNFG shall not
have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement), HNC Board has again in good
faith made the determination (A) in clause (i) of this Section 6.10(e) and
(B) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or modifying of the
HNC Recommendation or the making of a HNC Subsequent Determination by the HNC
Board shall not change the approval of the HNC Board for purposes of causing
any Takeover Laws to be inapplicable to this Agreement and the HNC Voting
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including
the Merger. 

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.10 shall prohibit HNC or the HNC Board
from complying with HNCÂ’s obligations required under Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act;  _provided_ , _howeve_ r, that any such
disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a change in
HNC Recommendation unless HNC Board reaffirms HNC Recommendation in such
disclosure. 

  

6.11. _Reserves and Merger-Related Costs._  

  

HNC agrees to consult with FNFG with respect to its loan, litigation and real
estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and
levels of reserves). FNFG and HNC shall also consult with respect to the
character, amount and timing of restructuring charges to be taken by each of
them in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and shall take
such charges as FNFG shall reasonably request and which are not inconsistent
with GAAP, provided that (i) no such actions need be effected until FNFG
shall have irrevocably certified to HNC that all conditions set forth in
Article IX to the obligation of FNFG to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than the delivery of certificates or
opinions) have been satisfied or, where legally permissible, waive, and (ii)
the effect of any such actions shall not be included n calculating HNC
Delinquent Loans. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

6.12. _Board of Directors and Committee Meetings._  

  

HNC and HNB shall permit representatives of FNFG (no more than two) to attend
any meeting of the Board of Directors of HNC and/or HNB or the Executive and
Loan Committees thereof as an observer, provided that neither HNC nor HNB
shall be required to permit the FNFG representative to remain present during
any confidential discussion of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby or any third party proposal to acquire
control of HNC or HNB or during any other matter that the respective Board of
Directors has reasonably determined to be confidential with respect to FNFGÂ’s
participation. FNFG shall bear all legal and financial responsibility
for ensuring that observer rights shall not constitute control of HNC or HNB
under applicable laws. 

  

ARTICLE VII 
 COVENANTS OF FNFG 

   

7.1. _Conduct of Business._  

  

During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,

unreasonably withheld, FNFG will, and it will cause each FNFG Subsidiary to
use reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business organization and
assets and maintain its rights and franchises; and voluntarily take no action
that would, or would be reasonably likely to: (i) adversely affect the
ability of the parties to obtain the Regulatory Approvals or other approvals
of Governmental Entities required for the transaction contemplated hereby, or
materially increase the period of time necessary to obtain such
approvals; (ii) adversely affect its ability to perform its covenants and
agreements under this Agreement; or (iii) result in the representations and
warranties contained in Article V of this Agreement not being true and

not being satisfied. 

  

7.2. _Current Information._

contemplated hereby, at such times as HNC may reasonably request. FNFG will
promptly notify HNC, to the extent permitted by applicable law, of any
governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated), which might adversely affect
the ability of the parties to obtain the Regulatory Approvals or
materially increase the period of time necessary to obtain such approvals; or
the institution of material litigation involving FNFG and any FNFG
Subsidiary. FNFG shall be reasonably responsive to requests by HNC for access
to such information and personnel regarding FNFG and its Subsidiaries as may
be reasonably necessary for HNC to confirm that the representations and
warranties of FNFG contained herein are true and correct and that the
covenants of FNFG contained herein have been performed in all material
respects; provided, however, that FNFG shall not be required to take any
action that would provide access to or to disclose information where such
access or disclosure, in FNFGÂ’s reasonable judgment, 

 

    ##### 

  

   

would interfere with the normal conduct of FNFGÂ’s business or would violate or
prejudice the rights or business interests or confidences of any customer or
other person or would result in the waiver by it of the privilege protecting
communications between it and any of its counsel. 

  

7.3. _Financial and Other Statements._  

  

FNFG will make available to HNC the Securities Documents filed by it with the
SEC under the Securities Laws. FNFG will furnish to HNC copies of all
documents, statements and reports as it or FNFG file with the OTS or any
other Bank Regulator authority with respect to the Merger. FNFG will furnish
to HNC copies of all documents, statements and reports as it or any FNFG
Subsidiary sends to the shareholders of FNFG. 

  

7.4. _Disclosure Supplements._  

  

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, FNFG will promptly supplement
or amend the FNFG Disclosure Schedule delivered in connection herewith with
respect to any material matter hereafter arising which, if existing,
occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in such FNFG Disclosure Schedule or which is
necessary to correct any information in such FNFG Disclosure Schedule which
has been rendered inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such FNFG
Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect for the purpose of determining
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX. 

  

7.5. _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties._  

  

FNFG shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as soon as
practicable all consents and approvals, necessary or desirable for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

7.6. _All Reasonable Efforts._  

  

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, FNFG agrees to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

7.7. _Failure to Fulfill Conditions._  

  

In the event that FNFG determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that
condition, it will promptly notify HNC. 

  

7.8. _Employee Benefits._  

  

7.8.1. FNFG will review all HNC Compensation and Benefit Plans to determine
whether to maintain, terminate or continue such plans. In the event employee
compensation and/or benefits as currently provided by HNC or any HNC
Subsidiary are changed or terminated by FNFG, in whole or in part, FNFG shall
provide Continuing Employees (as defined below) with compensation and
benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially similar to the 

 

    ##### 

  

   

compensation and benefits provided to similarly situated employees of FNFG or
applicable FNFG Subsidiary (as of the date any such compensation or benefit
is provided). Employees of HNC or any HNC Subsidiary who become participants
in an FNFG Compensation and Benefit Plan shall, for purposes of determining
eligibility for and for any applicable vesting periods of such employee
benefits only (and not for benefit accrual purposes unless specifically set
forth herein) be given credit for meeting eligibility and vesting
requirements in such plans for service as an employee of HNC or HNB or any
predecessor thereto prior to the Effective Time, provided, however, that
credit for prior service shall not be given for any purpose under the FNFG
ESOP, and provided further, that credit for benefit accrual purposes will be
given only for purposes of FNFG vacation policies or programs and for
purposes of the calculation of severance benefits under any severance
compensation plan of FNFG. This Agreement shall not be construed to limit the
ability of FNFG or First Niagara Bank to terminate the employment of any
employee or to review employee benefits programs from time to time and to
make such changes (including terminating any program) as they deem
appropriate. 

  

7.8.2. FNFG shall honor the terms of all employment, consulting and change in
control agreements set forth on HNC Disclosure Schedule 4.13.1. 

  

7.8.3. Any employee of HNC or any HNC Subsidiary who is not a party to an
employment, consulting, change in control or severance agreement or contract
providing severance payments and whose employment is terminated at or before
the Effective Time or within six (6) months after the Effective Time, shall
receive severance benefits in accordance with HNCÂ’s severance practice,
as set forth in HNC Disclosure Schedule 7.8.3. Any employees of HNC or any
HNC Subsidiary who continue employment with FNFG or an FNFG Subsidiary for
more than six (6) months after the Effective Time shall, upon any subsequent
termination of employment, be covered by and eligible to receive severance
benefits under the FNFG severance plan, as set forth in FNFG Disclosure
Schedule 7.8.3, in accordance with the terms of such plan or policy. 

  

7.8.4. In the event of any termination or consolidation of any HNC health plan
with any FNFG health plan, FNFG shall make available to employees of HNC or
any HNC Subsidiary who continue employment with FNFG or an FNFG Subsidiary
("Continuing Employees") and their dependents employer-provided health
coverage on the same basis as it provides such coverage to FNFG
employees. Unless a Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates coverage
under an HNC health plan prior to the time that such Continuing Employee
becomes eligible to participate in the FNFG health plan, no coverage of any
of the Continuing Employees or their dependents shall terminate under any of
the HNC health plans prior to the time such Continuing Employees and their
dependents become eligible to participate in the health plans, programs and
benefits common to all employees of FNFG and their dependents. In the event
of a termination or consolidation of any HNC health plan, terminated
HNC employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continued
coverage under group health plans of FNFG in accordance with COBRA,
consistent with the provisions below. All HNC Employees who cease
participating in an HNC health plan and become participants in a comparable
FNFG health plan (each a "Former HNC Health Plan Participant") shall receive
credit for any co-payment and deductibles paid under HNCÂ’s health plan for
purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under the FNFG health plan, upon substantiation, in a form
satisfactory to FNFG that such co-payment and/or deductible has been
satisfied. With 

 

    ##### 

  

   

respect to any Former HNC Health Plan Participant, any coverage limitation
under the FNFG health plan due to any pre-existing condition shall be waived
by the FNFG health plan to the degree that such condition was covered by the
HNC health plan and such condition would otherwise have been covered by the
FNFG health plan in the absence of such coverage limitation. 

  

7.9. _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._  

  

7.9.1. For a period of six years after the Effective Time, FNFG shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or who has been
at any time before the date hereof or who becomes before the Effective Time,
an officer, director or employee of HNC or an HNC Subsidiary (the
"Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses
(including attorneyÂ’s fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are
paid in settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written consent
of FNFG, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, or administrative (each a "Claim"), in which an Indemnified
Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party or witness in whole or in part
or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer or employee of HNC or an HNC Subsidiary if such
Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring at or
before the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is
asserted or claimed before, or after, the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent as would have been permitted by HNC under the PCBL and under HNCÂ’s
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. FNFG shall pay expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified
Party to the fullest extent as would have been permitted by HNC under the
PCBL and under HNCÂ’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, upon receipt of
an undertaking to repay such advance payments if he shall be adjudicated or
determined to be not entitled to indemnification in the manner set forth
below. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
Section 7.9.1 upon learning of any Claim, shall notify FNFG (but the failure
so to notify FNFG shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have
under this Section 7.9.1, except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices FNFG) and shall deliver to FNFG the undertaking referred to in the
previous section. 

  

7.9.2. In the event that either FNFG or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving bank or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of FNFG shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 7.9. 

  

7.9.3. FNFG shall maintain, or shall cause First Niagara Bank to maintain, in
effect for six years following the Effective Time, the current directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance policies covering the officers and directors of
HNC (provided, that FNFG may substitute therefore policies of at least the
same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not materially less
favorable) with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time; provided, however, that in no event shall FNFG be required to expend
pursuant to this Section 7.9.3 more than 200% of the annual cost currently
expended by HNC with respect to such insurance (the "Maximum Amount");
_provided, further,_ that if the amount of the annual premium necessary to
maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount,
FNFG 

 

    ##### 

  

   

shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In connection
with the foregoing, HNC agrees in order for FNFG to fulfill its agreement to
provide directors and officers liability insurance policies for six years to
provide such insurer or substitute insurer with such reasonable and
customary representations as such insurer may request with respect to the
reporting of any prior claims. 

  

7.9.4. The obligations of FNFG provided under this Section 7.9 are intended to
be enforceable against FNFG directly by the Indemnified Parties and shall be
binding on all respective successors and permitted assigns of FNFG. 

  

7.10. _Stock Listing._  

  

FNFG agrees to list on the Nasdaq (or such other national securities exchange
on which the shares of the FNFG Common Stock shall be listed as of the date
of consummation of the Merger), subject to official notice of issuance, the
shares of FNFG Common Stock to be issued in the Merger. 

  

7.11. _Stock and Cash Reserve._  

  

FNFG agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the Merger
Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of shares
of its common stock and to maintain sufficient liquid accounts or borrowing
capacity to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

judgment, necessary or desirable, (ii) subject to Section 6.10, have its
Board of Directors recommend approval of this Agreement to the HNC

the form mailed to the HNC shareholders, together with any and all amendments
or supplements thereto, being herein referred to as the "Proxy Statement-
Prospectus"). FNFG shall file the Merger Registration Statement, 

 

    ##### 

  

   

including the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, with the SEC. Each of FNFG and HNC
shall use their best efforts to have the Merger Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing, and each of HNC and FNFG shall thereafter promptly mail the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus to the HNC shareholders. FNFG shall also use its
best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and HNC shall furnish all information concerning HNC and the
holders of HNC Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with

give HNC and its counsel the opportunity to review and comment on all
amendments and supplements to the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and all

supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of HNC Common Stock entitled

Statement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. In such event, HNC shall cooperate with FNFG in
the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such Proxy Statement-
Prospectus that corrects such misstatement or omission, and FNFG shall file
an amended Merger Registration Statement with the SEC, and HNC shall mail an
amended Proxy Statement-Prospectus to the HNC shareholders. If requested by
FNFG, HNC shall obtain a "comfort" letter from its independent certified
public accountant, dated as of the date of the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and

financial information regarding HNC, in form and substance that is customary

and all waiting periods relating to such approvals, authorizations or
consents shall have expired; and no such approval, authorization or consent

warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the other party, which

terminating party to the other party provided, however, that neither party
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
11.1.2 unless the breach of representation or warranty, together with all

of a breach of a representation or warranty by FNFG);

the terminating party to the other party provided, however, that neither

covenant by FNFG); 

  

11.1.4. At the election of the Board of Directors of either party if the
Closing shall not have occurred by the Termination Date, or such later date
as shall have been agreed to in writing by FNFG and HNC; provided, that no

such partyÂ’s material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained in this Agreement; 

  

11.1.5. By the Board of Directors of either party if the shareholders of HNC
shall have voted at the HNC Shareholders Meeting on the transactions

recommendation of this Agreement, fails to make such recommendation or
modifies or qualifies its recommendation in a manner adverse to FNFG; 

 

    ##### 

  

  

11.1.9. By the Board of Directors of HNC if HNC has received a Superior
Proposal, and in accordance with Section 6.10 of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of HNC has made a determination to accept such Superior Proposal; 

  

11.1.10. By HNC, if its Board of Directors so determines by a majority vote of
the members of its entire Board, at any time during the five-day period
commencing on the Determination Date, such termination to be effective on the
10th day following such Determination Date ("Effective Termination Date"), if
both of the following conditions are satisfied: 

   

(i) The FNFG Market Value on the Determination Date is less than $9.28; and 

   

(ii) (a) the number obtained by dividing the FNFG Market Value on the
Determination Date by the Initial FNFG Market Value ("FNFG Ratio") shall be
less than (b) the quotient obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by the

subject, however, to the following three sentences. If HNC elects to exercise
its termination right pursuant to this Section 11.1.10, it shall give prompt
written notice thereof to FNFG. During the five business day period
commencing with its receipt of such notice, FNFG shall have the option to
increase the consideration to be received by the holders of HNC Common Stock
hereunder by adjusting the Exchange Ratio to one of the following quotients
at its sole discretion: (i) a quotient, the numerator of which is equal to
the product of the Initial FNFG Market Value, the Exchange Ratio (as then in
effect), and the Index Ratio minus 0.20, and the denominator of which
is equal to FNFG Market Value on the Determination Date; or (ii) the quotient
determined by dividing the Initial FNFG Market Value by the FNFG Market Value
on the Determination Date, and multiplying the quotient by the product of the
Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and 0.80. If FNFG so elects, it shall
give, within such five business-day period, written notice to HNC of such
