Representative    -v-   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the
"AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as of October 3, 2002 by and among
Documentum, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), Copper Top Acquisition
Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
("SUB"), eRoom Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"),
Jeffrey R. Beir as stockholder representative (the "STOCKHOLDER
REPRESENTATIVE"), and U.S. Bank, N.A. as escrow agent (the
"ESCROW AGENT").   RECITALS   A.The Boards of Directors of each of
Parent, Sub and the Company believe it is in the best interests of each
company and its respective stockholders that Parent acquire the Company
through the statutory merger of Sub with and into the Company (the "MERGER")
and, in furtherance thereof, have approved the Merger.   B.Pursuant to the
Merger, among other things, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company
shall be converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth
herein, all issued and outstanding options to purchase capital stock of the
Company shall be assumed by Parent and converted into options to
purchase common stock of Parent as set forth herein and all outstanding
warrants to purchase capital stock of the Company, if any, shall be cancelled
and extinguished.   C.The Company and certain stockholders of the Company
on the one hand, and Parent and Sub, on the other hand, desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in
connection with the Merger.   D.Concurrent with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, as a material inducement to Parent and Sub to enter into
this Agreement, (a) all officers and directors of the Company, and certain
other stockholders of the Company are entering into Voting Agreements, in
substantially the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT A (each a "VOTING
AGREEMENT"), with Parent, and (b) the Key Employees are entering into Non-
Competition Agreements, each in substantially the form attached hereto as
EXHIBIT B (each a "NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT"), Key Employee Lock-Up
Agreements, each in substantially the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT C (each
a "KEY EMPLOYEE LOCK-UP AGREEMENT"), and Vesting Modification Agreements,
each in substantially the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT D (each a "VESTING
MODIFICATION AGREEMENT").   E.For federal income tax purposes, the parties
intend that (a) the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "CODE") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
and (b) this Agreement constitutes a plan of reorganization.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and other
promises set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by
the performance thereof, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, the
parties hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1 THE
MERGER. At the Effective Time (as defined in SECTION 1.2 hereof) and subject
to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("DELAWARE
LAW"), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate
existence of Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The
surviving corporation after the Merger is sometimes referred to hereinafter
as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION." Following the Merger, Parent intends to cause
the Surviving Corporation to be merged with and into Parent, whereby the
separate corporate existence of the Surviving Corporation shall cease, and
Parent shall continue as the Surviving Corporation. The parties intend for
the Merger and the subsequent merger of the Surviving Corporation with and
into Parent to be treated as an integrated transaction which shall qualify as
a "reorganization" pursuant to Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, in
accordance with Revenue Ruling 2001-46, 2001-2 CB 321.   1.2 EFFECTIVE
TIME. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to SECTION 8.1
hereof, the closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") will take place as promptly
as practicable after the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto,
and following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE
VI hereof, at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional
Corporation, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California, unless another time
or place is mutually agreed upon in writing by Parent and the Company. The
date upon which the Closing actually occurs shall be referred to herein as
the "CLOSING DATE." On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger in substantially
the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT E, with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER"), in accordance with
the applicable provisions of Delaware Law (the time of acceptance by the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware such filing, or at such other
time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of
Merger, shall be referred to herein as the "EFFECTIVE TIME").   1.3 EFFECT
OF THE MERGER. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as
provided in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
except as otherwise agreed to pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
and Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.   1.4 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND
BYLAWS.   (a) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the certificate
of incorporation of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided
in   -2-  such certificate of incorporation; provided, however, that at
the Effective Time, Article I of the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read
as follows: "The name of the corporation is eRoom Technology, Inc."   (b)
Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the bylaws
of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time until thereafter
amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.   1.5 DIRECTORS
AND OFFICERS.   (a) DIRECTORS OF COMPANY. Unless otherwise determined by
Parent prior to the Effective Time, the directors of Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation
immediately after the Effective Time, each to hold the office of a director
of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the provisions of Delaware
Law and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors are duly elected and qualified.   (b)
OFFICERS OF COMPANY. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the
Effective Time, the officers of Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the provisions of
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   (c) DIRECTORS OF SUBSIDIARY.
Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, Parent,
the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the directors of Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the directors of any Subsidiary
(as defined in SECTION 2.3 hereof) immediately after the Effective Time, each
to hold office as a director of such Subsidiary in accordance with the
provisions of the laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation and charter
documents and the bylaws of such Subsidiary.   (d) OFFICERS OF SUBSIDIARY.
Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, Parent,
the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the officers of Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the officers of any Subsidiary
immediately after the Effective Time, each to hold office as a director of
Subsidiary in accordance with the provisions of the laws of the jurisdiction
of incorporation and charter documents and the bylaws of such Subsidiary.  
1.6 EFFECT OF MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS.  
(a) EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holders
of shares of the Company Capital Stock, each share of Company Capital Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Dissenting Shares (as defined in SECTION 1.7(a) hereof), upon the terms
and subject to conditions set forth in this SECTION 1.6 and throughout
this Agreement, including,   -3-  without limitation, the escrow
provisions set forth in ARTICLE VII hereof, will be canceled and extinguished
and be converted automatically into the right to receive, upon surrender of
the certificate representing such shares of Company Capital Stock in the
manner provided in SECTION 1.8 hereof, such number of shares of Parent Common
Stock and an amount of cash (without interest) as set forth below:   (i)
Each share of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock equal to the Common Equivalent Share Amount and an amount
of cash equal to the Common Equivalent Cash Amount.   (ii) Each share of
Parent Common Stock issued for a share of Company Unvested Common Stock
pursuant to this SECTION 1.6 shall, except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement or the Related Agreements, continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions (including vesting terms) set forth in the Stock
Plan, as applicable, and the agreements relating to such Company Unvested
Common Stock, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (iii)
The aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to each
Stockholder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, and no cash will be paid for fractional shares.   (b)
ASSUMPTION OF COMPANY OPTIONS; CANCELLATION OF COMPANY WARRANTS.   (i) At
the Effective Time, Parent shall assume each Company Option. Each Company
Option so assumed by Parent pursuant to this section shall continue to have,
and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms)
set forth in the Stock Plan and the option agreements relating thereto, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that:   (A) each
assumed Company Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in
accordance with its terms) for that number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
equal to the sum of (1) the product of (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Common Equivalent Share Amount, plus (2)
the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
(y) the quotient of (i) the Common Equivalent Cash Amount divided by (ii)
the Trading Price. After the Effective Time, the per share exercise price for
each such assumed Company Option shall be determined by dividing the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the sum of (1) the Common
Equivalent Share Amount, plus (2) the quotient of (x) the Common Equivalent
Cash Amount divided by (y) the Trading Price, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent. It is the intention of the parties that the Company Options so assumed
by Parent qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock  
-4-  options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent that such
Company Options qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective
Time and Parent and Company will act consistently therewith.   (B) Upon the
exercise of a Company Option after the Effective Time and before the
distribution of all of the Escrow Funds (to the Stockholders, Parent, or a
combination of the foregoing), on behalf of the person exercising such
Company Option and without any further action on the part of such person,
Parent shall deposit into the Stock Escrow Fund a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to such person\'s pro rata share of the Escrow Amount out
of the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable
to such person. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be deposited into the
Stock Escrow Fund shall be deemed to have been deposited into the Stock
Escrow Fund at the Effective Time and shall be treated in a manner consistent
with the treatment of the shares of Parent Common Stock deposited into the
Stock Escrow Fund pursuant to SECTION 7.3(a) and shares of Parent Common
Stock held in the Stock Escrow Fund, whether deposited pursuant to SECTION
7.3(a) hereof or upon the exercise of a Company Option, as set forth in this
SUBSECTION 1.6(b)(i)(b), shall be treated in the same manner for purposes of
ARTICLE VII.   (ii) At the Effective Time, each Warrant shall not be
assumed by Parent and will by virtue of the Merger, and without any further
action on the part of any holder thereof, be cancelled and extinguished.  
(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action
necessary to effect the transactions anticipated by this SECTION 1.6 under
all Company Option agreements, all agreements related to Company
Unvested Common Stock, all Company Warrant agreements and any other plan or
arrangement of the Company (whether written or oral, formal or informal).  
(c) ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT. As soon as practicable following the Closing, but
in no event later than twenty (20) days after the Closing Date, Parent
shall issue to each holder of a Company Option to be assumed by Parent
pursuant to SECTION 1.6(b), a document evidencing the assumption of such
Company Option by Parent, and each former holder of a Company Option so
assumed by Parent shall acknowledge the receipt of the same in exchange for
such holder\'s Company Option.   (d) WITHHOLDING TAXES. Any number of
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to a Stockholder pursuant to SECTION
1.6(a) shall be subject to applicable state, federal and foreign withholding
taxes incurred (and not previously paid by or on behalf of such Stockholder
or the Company) in connection with the acquisition of Company Capital Stock
upon the exercise of Company Options, upon the lapsing of repurchase rights
in respect of shares of Company Common Stock, or upon payment of a bonus in
the form of Company Common Stock, if any, to such Stockholder. A Stockholder
shall not be entitled to receive its portion of the Share Consideration until
it delivers an amount in cash by check equal to the amount of applicable
withholding taxes.   -5-   (e) CAPITAL STOCK OF SUB. Each share of capital
stock of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and exchanged for one (1) validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each
stock certificate of Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall
continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.   (f) SHARES SUBJECT TO VESTING. If any shares of
Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition under any applicable stock restriction
agreement or other agreement with the Company, then the shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Capital Stock
shall also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition (including any requirement that any unvested
shares be held in escrow), and the certificate representing such shares of
Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends in the
discretion of Parent, except that prior to the Effective Time, each
Key Employee who holds Company Unvested Common Stock shall have waived and
amended all rights regarding acceleration of vesting or lapsing of repurchase
rights upon the Merger that would take effect as a result of the terms of
employment offered to such Key Employee set forth in an Offer Letter (as
defined in SECTION 5.12), to the extent such provisions exist, by entering
into a Vesting Modification Agreement.   1.7 DISSENTING SHARES.   (a)
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has not effectively
withdrawn or lost such holder\'s appraisal rights under Delaware
Law ("DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted into or represent a right
to receive the applicable consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth
in SECTION 1.6(A) hereof, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to
such rights as are provided by Delaware Law.   (b) Notwithstanding the
provisions of SECTION 1.7(a), if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such
holder\'s appraisal rights under Delaware Law, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder\'s shares shall
automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the
consideration for Company Capital Stock, as applicable, set forth in SECTION
1.6, without interest thereon, and subject to the provisions of SECTION 7.3,
upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares.   (c) The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand for
appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
such demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent that Parent or the Company (i) makes any payment
or payments in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the
consideration that otherwise would have been payable in   -6-  respect of
such shares in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) incurs any other costs
or expenses, (including specifically, but without limitation, attorneys\'
fees, costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding or in
connection with any investigation) in respect of any Dissenting
Shares (excluding payments for such shares) (together "DISSENTING SHARE
PAYMENTS"), Parent shall be entitled to recover under the terms of ARTICLE
VII the amount of such Dissenting Share Payments.   1.8 SURRENDER OF
CERTIFICATES.   (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. An institution selected by Parent shall
serve as the exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") for the Merger.   (b)
PARENT TO PROVIDE PARENT COMMON STOCK AND CASH. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in
accordance with this ARTICLE I the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
and cash payable pursuant to SECTION 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares
of Company Capital Stock; provided, however, that, on behalf of the
Stockholders, Parent shall deposit into the Stock Escrow Fund a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Escrow Share Amount out of the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable to the
Stockholders pursuant to SECTION 1.6 and cash equal to the Cash Escrow Amount
out of the aggregate amount of cash otherwise issuable to the Stockholders
pursuant to SECTION 1.6. In the event any Stockholder holds shares of Company
Capital Stock that include shares of Company Unvested Common Stock, the
proportion of vested and unvested Parent Common Stock deposited into the
Stock Escrow Fund shall be equal to the proportion of vested and unvested
Company Capital Stock held by such Stockholder. Each Stockholder shall be
deemed to have contributed his, her or its pro rata portion of the Escrow
Amount to the Escrow Funds, in the case of the Stock Escrow Fund, rounded to
the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock.   (c) EXCHANGE
PROCEDURES. On or within five (5) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall
mail a letter of transmittal in such form and having such provisions as
Parent may reasonably determine and, if applicable, a Lock-Up Agreement, to
each Stockholder at the address set forth opposite each such Stockholder\'s
name on the Spreadsheet (as defined in SECTION 5.21 hereof). After receipt of
such letter of transmittal, the Stockholders will surrender the certificates
representing their shares of Company Capital Stock (the "COMPANY STOCK
CERTIFICATES") to the Exchange Agent for cancellation together with a
duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal. Subject to SECTION
1.8(d), upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto subject to the
terms of SECTION 1.8(f), the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall
be entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent in exchange therefor, a
certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
and the cash amounts less the number of shares of Parent Common Stock and
cash to be deposited in the Escrow Funds on such holder\'s behalf pursuant to
SECTION 1.8(b) and ARTICLE VII hereof to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to SECTION 1.6(a), and the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered
shall be canceled. Until so surrendered, each Company Stock Certificate
outstanding   -7-  after the Effective Time will be deemed from and for

SEC DOCUMENTS; PARENT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A true and complete copy of each

proxy statement filed by Parent with the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") since June 30, 2000 (the "PARENT SEC DOCUMENTS") is available on the
web site maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. As of their respective
filing dates, the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES
ACT"), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE
ACT"), as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and none
of the Parent SEC Documents contained on their respective filing dates any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
to the extent corrected by a subsequently filed Parent SEC Document. The
financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents (the
"PARENT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS") complied as to form in all material respects
with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto,
were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto, except in the case of pro forma statements, or, in the case of
unaudited financial statements, except as permitted under Form 10-Q under the
Exchange Act) and fairly presented the consolidated financial position of
Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof
and the consolidated results of Parent\'s operations and cash flows for the
periods indicated (subject to, in the case of unaudited statements, normal
and recurring year-end audit adjustments). Parent knows of no reason why it
would not be able to provide the certifications required by Sections 302 and
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in connection with the filing of
Parent\'s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,

to which Parent is a party do not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby will not conflict with or result in any
violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) or give rise to a Conflict under (i) any provision of the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Sub, as in effect on the date hereof,
(ii) any Contract to which Parent or Sub or any of their respective
properties or assets (whether tangible or intangible) is subject, or (iii)
any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
applicable to Parent or Sub or any of their respective properties (whether
tangible or intangible) or assets, except, in each case, for such conflicts
as would not individually or in the aggregate have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.   -41-   3.10 PARENT CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The authorized stock of
Parent consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, of
which 39,886,070 shares were issued and outstanding as of August 31, 2002,

the Commissioner of Corporations of the State of California (after a hearing
before such Commissioner) pursuant to Sections 25121 and 25142 of the
California Corporate Securities Law of 1968 (the "FAIRNESS HEARING LAW"), so
that the issuance of (i) Parent Common Stock in the Merger and (ii) Company
Options, shall be exempt from registration under the Securities Act, by
virtue of the exemption provided by SECTION 3(a)(10) thereof, and the Company
shall prepare, with the cooperation of Parent, a related information

and issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by the
holders of Company Capital Stock in the Merger. The Company shall cooperate
with, and provide information to, Parent in connection with Parent\'s
application for the California Permit. Company and Parent will respond to any
comments from the California Department of Corporations and work together in
good faith to use their commercially reasonable efforts to have the
California Permit granted as soon as practicable after such filing. Each of
Parent and the Company agrees to provide promptly to the other such
information concerning its business and financial statements and affairs as,
in the reasonable judgment of the providing party or its counsel, may be
required or appropriate under the Fairness Hearing Law and
applicable securities laws for inclusion in the Information Statement, or in
any amendments or supplements thereto, and to cause its counsel and auditors
to cooperate with the other\'s counsel and auditors in preparation of the
Information Statement. Anything to the contrary contained herein
notwithstanding, the Company shall not include in the Information Statement
any information with respect to Parent or its affiliates or associates, the
form and content of which shall not have been approved by Parent prior to
such inclusion, except as required pursuant to the Fairness Hearing Law or
other applicable securities laws. As promptly as practical after the date of
this Agreement, Parent and Company shall prepare and make such filings as are
required under applicable blue sky laws relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Company shall use reasonable and good faith
efforts to assist Parent as may be necessary to comply with the securities
and blue sky laws relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   (b) In the event that the Commissioner of Corporations of
the State of California denies the California Permit or if the parties
mutually determine that they will not receive the California Permit by
December 2, 2002 (provided that the Company and the signatories to the Voting
Agreements have cooperated in good faith to obtain the California Permit),
Parent shall, if requested by the Company, promptly, but in no event more
than twenty (20) business days after denial of the California Permit or such
mutual determination, file a registration statement on Form S-4 filed with
the SEC (the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT") to cause the issuance of the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be registered, in which
case:   (i) the Company shall promptly advise Parent, and Parent shall
promptly advise the Company, in writing if at any time prior to the Effective
Time either the Company or Parent shall obtain knowledge of any facts that
might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement the
Registration Statement or the proxy statement and/or prospectus to be sent to
Stockholders in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting (the "PROXY
STATEMENT"), in order to make the statements contained or incorporated by
reference therein not misleading or to    -47-  comply with applicable
law, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in filing with the SEC or its
staff or any other government officials, and/or delivery to the holders of
Company Capital Stock, any such amendment or supplement;   (ii) the Company
and Parent shall prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, the
Registration Statement, which shall include the Proxy Statement, and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement
to become effective as soon thereafter as practicable;   (iii) each party
hereto shall notify the other promptly of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or its staff and or any request by the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials for amendments or supplements to the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement or any other filing or for additional
information and shall supply the other with copies of all correspondence
between such party or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with
respect to the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement or other filing;
and   (iv) the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement and any
other materials submitted to the Stockholders in connection with the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting (as defined in SECTION 5.1(C) below) will
comply in all material respects with applicable law and the rules and
regulations thereunder.   (c) As promptly as practicable after the receipt
of a California Permit or following the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement, the Company shall submit this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby to the Stockholders for approval and adoption as provided
by Delaware Law and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company. Such submission, and any proxy or consent in connection therewith,
shall specify that adoption of this Agreement shall constitute approval by
the Stockholders of: (A) the escrow and indemnification obligations of the
Stockholders set forth in ARTICLE VII hereof and the deposit of Parent Common
Stock and cash equal to the Escrow Amount into the Escrow Funds and (B) in
favor of the appointment of Jeffrey Beir as Stockholder Representative, under
and as defined in this Agreement. Any materials to be submitted to the
Stockholders in connection with the solicitation of their approval of the

review and approval by Parent and shall include information regarding the
Company, the terms of the Merger and this Agreement, and the unanimous
recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company in favor of the

Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, the Company shall
not include in the Soliciting Materials any information with respect
to Parent or its affiliates or associates, the form and content of which
shall not have been approved by Parent prior to such inclusion which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall consult with Parent
regarding the date of the Company Stockholders\' meeting to approve this
Agreement and the Merger (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS\' MEETING") and shall not
postpone or adjourn (other than for absence of a quorum) the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting   -48-  without the consent of Parent which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of its Stockholders sufficient to
approve the Merger and this Agreement and to enable the Closing to occur as
promptly as practicable following the date hereof and, in any event, within
thirty (30) days following the receipt of the California Permit or
effectiveness of the Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company shall give Stockholders sufficient notice such that no
Stockholder will be able to exercise appraisal rights if such Stockholder has
not perfected such appraisal rights prior to Closing, pursuant to Section 262
of Delaware Law.   5.2 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. The Company shall afford
Parent and its accountants, counsel and other representatives, reasonable
access during the period from the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time

all other information concerning the business, properties and personnel
(subject to restrictions imposed by applicable law) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request, and (iii) all Employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as identified by Parent. The Company agrees to
provide to Parent and its accountants, counsel and other representatives
copies of internal financial statements (including Tax Returns and supporting
documentation) promptly upon request. No information or knowledge obtained in

be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger in
accordance with the terms and provisions hereof.   5.3 CONFIDENTIALITY.
Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the information obtained in any
investigation pursuant to SECTION 5.2 hereof, or pursuant to the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement or the effectuation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall be governed by the terms of the Confidential
Disclosure Agreement effective as of April 26, 2002 (the "CONFIDENTIAL
DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT") between the Company and Parent. In this regard, the
Company acknowledges that the Parent Common Stock is publicly traded and that
any information obtained during the course of its due diligence could be
considered to be material non-public information within the meaning
of federal and state securities laws.   5.4 EXPENSES. Whether or not the
Merger is consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Merger, including, without limitation, all legal, accounting, tax and all
other fees and expenses of third parties (excluding the fees of Thomas Weisel
Partners for investment banking services), incurred by a party in connection
with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby ("THIRD PARTY EXPENSES"),
shall be the obligation of the respective party incurring such fees and
expenses; provided, however, that Parent agrees to pay up to an aggregate of
$625,000 in reasonable and documented Third Party Expenses for expenses
incurred by the Company up to and including the Closing Date if the Merger is
consummated. Any Third Party Expenses incurred by the Company in excess of
$625,000 that are not part of the Third Party Expense Adjustment Amount, if
any ("EXCESS THIRD PARTY EXPENSES"), shall be paid out of the Escrow Amount.
Third Party Expenses shall not be incurred by the Company after the Closing
Date without the express prior written consent of   -49-  Parent. No
Subsidiary shall incur any Third Party Expenses. Notwithstanding this SECTION
5.4, if the scope of legal, accounting and tax services required by
the Company (excluding fees relating to investment banking services) are
materially different than those transaction assumptions set forth in SCHEDULE
5.4 of this Agreement, due to necessary changes to the transactions
contemplated by the parties hereto, then Parent and the Company agree to
renegotiate in good faith the amount of Third Party Expenses that Parent
agrees to pay hereunder.   5.5 PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. Other than with respect to
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII hereof, no party
shall issue any statement or communication to any third party (other than
their respective agents that are bound by confidentiality restrictions)
regarding the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, without the consent of the other party (provided,
however, that Parent, in its sole discretion, can determine the timing of any
such statement or communication made on or after the execution of this
Agreement), except that this restriction shall be subject to Parent\'s
obligation to comply with applicable securities laws and the rules of the
Nasdaq Stock Market.   5.6 CONSENTS. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of
any parties to any Contract (including with respect to the Lease Agreements)
as are required thereunder in connection with the Merger or for any such
Contracts to remain in full force and effect, all of which are listed in
SECTION 2.5 of the Disclosure Schedule, so as to preserve all rights of, and
benefits to, the Company under such Contract from and after the Effective
Time. Such consents, waivers and approvals shall be in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent. In the event that the other parties to any such
Contract, including lessor or licensor of any Leased Real Property,

imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of them
to conduct their businesses or to own or exercise control of such
assets, properties and stock.   5.9 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of: (i) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is likely
to cause any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this

(ii) any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.  
5.10 ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS AND FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each party hereto, at the
request of another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such
other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be

NEW EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS. Parent may offer certain Employees "at-will"
employment by Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, to be effective as of
the Closing Date, upon proof of a legal right to work in the United States.
Such "at-will" employment will: (i) be set forth in offer letters (each, an

Parent after consultation with the Company\'s management, and (iv) supersede

of this Agreement, each Key Employee shall execute an Offer Letter which
shall be effective as of the Closing Date. Each employee of the Company who
remains an employee of Parent or the Surviving Corporation after the Closing
Date shall be referred to hereafter as a "CONTINUING EMPLOYEE." Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to receive benefits consistent with Parent\'s
applicable human resources policies. For purposes of any length of service
requirements, waiting periods, vesting periods or differential benefits based
on length of service under any benefit plans of Parent (except for Parent\'s
sabbatical plan) for which a Continuing Employee may be eligible after the
Closing Date, Parent shall make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that service by such Continuing Employee with the Company or any Subsidiary
shall be deemed to have been service with Parent. If the Company terminates
its 401(k)   -51-  Plan prior to the Closing Date in accordance with
SECTION 5.16 below, then Parent shall provide that Continuing Employees will
be eligible to participate in Parent\'s 401(k) Plan as soon as

be "affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 (each such
person, a "RULE 145 AFFILIATE") promulgated under the Securities Act ("RULE
145"). The Company shall provide Parent such information and documents as
Parent shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such list. Parent
and Sub shall be entitled to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to
the transfer agent for Parent Common Stock and to place the following legend
on the certificates evidencing any Parent Common Stock to be received by such
Affiliates pursuant to the terms of this Agreement:   "THE SHARES
REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A  TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE
145 APPLIES AND MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED IN  CONFORMITY WITH RULE 145(d) OR
PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION  STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933, AS AMENDED, OR IN  ACCORDANCE WITH A WRITTEN OPINION OF COUNSEL,
REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO  THE ISSUER IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE, THAT SUCH
TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM  REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED."   The legend set forth above shall be removed (by delivery of
a substitute certificate without such legend) and Parent shall so instruct
its transfer agent, if the Rule 145 Affiliate delivers to Parent (i)
satisfactory written evidence that the shares have been sold in compliance
with Rule 145 (in which case, the substitute certificate shall be issued in
the name of the transferee), or (ii) an opinion of counsel, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that public sale
of the shares by the holder thereof is no longer subject to Rule 145.  
5.15 STATEMENT OF EXPENSES. The Company shall provide Parent with a statement
of Estimated Third Party Expenses incurred by the Company three (3) business
days prior to the Closing Date in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the

the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of the Company and its

Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) plans shall
not be terminated). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the
Company, no later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such   -52-  Company
Employee Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors
of the Company, or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be. The form
and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of
Parent. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating such Company Employee Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably
require.   5.17 RESIGNATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. The Company shall

Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice ("DOJ"), Notification and Report Forms (as defined in
the HSR Act) relating to the transactions contemplated herein as required by
the HSR Act as well as comparable pre-merger notification forms required by
the merger notification or control laws and regulations of any applicable
jurisdiction, as agreed to by the parties. Company and Parent (and/or any
applicable Stockholder) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
any applicable stockholder of the Company to promptly (a) supply the others
with any information which reasonably may be required in order to effectuate
such filings and (b) supply any additional information which reasonably may
be required by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control
authorities of any other jurisdiction and which the parties may reasonably
deem appropriate; provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to
agree to any divestiture by Parent or the Company or any of Parent\'s
affiliates of share capital stock or of any business, assets or property of
Parent or its affiliates or of the Company or its affiliates, or the
imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to
conduct their businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets,
property and stock.   5.20 TERMINATION OF WARRANTS. The Company shall use

Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, the

applicable to each share of Preferred Stock), the date of acquisition of such
shares, the number of shares of the Share Consideration to be issued to each

settlement of outstanding Stockholder loans and such other information

shares of Company Capital Stock underlying each such Company Option, the
grant dates of such Company Options and the vesting arrangement with respect
to such Company Options and such other information relevant thereto or which

as represented in SECTION 2.2. The Company shall deliver the Spreadsheet
three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date.   5.22 OPTION GRANTS.
Parent will grant, effective upon the Closing Date, that number of non-
qualified options to purchase Parent Common Stock to the individuals listed
in SCHEDULE 5.22 as set forth opposite such individual\'s name; provided,
however, that the total aggregate number of options granted pursuant to this
SECTION 5.22 shall not exceed 500,000. Such options will be granted with an
exercise price equal to the fair market value of Parent Common Stock on the
Closing Date. Such options will vest twenty-five percent (25%) on the date
that is one (1) year after the Closing Date and 1/48th per
month thereafter.   5.23 VOTING AGREEMENTS. Concurrently with execution of

such respective capacities, to the effect that, each such officer,
severally and not jointly, represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as of
the date hereof that (i) he has read the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in ARTICLE II of this Agreement and the Disclosure
Schedule attached hereto and (ii) to his actual knowledge, such
representations and warranties taken as a whole (as modified by the
Disclosure Schedule) do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact,
or omit to state any material fact necessary in order   -54-  to make
such representations and warranties taken as a whole (as modified by
the Disclosure Schedule) in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.   5.27 TERMINATION OF AGREEMENTS. The Company shall
use its best efforts to terminate each of the agreements listed on SCHEDULE
6.2(c) to this Agreement (the "Terminated Agreements"), concurrent with or
prior to Closing, such that each such agreement shall be of no further force
or effect. Prior to Closing, the Company shall pay all amounts owed under the
Terminated Agreements (as a result of the termination of the Terminated
Agreements or otherwise), and the Surviving Corporation will not incur any
claim, liability or obligation (absolute, accrued, asserted or unasserted,
contingent or otherwise) under any Terminated Agreement following the Closing
Date.   5.28 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.   (a) After the
Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and
hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an
officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the
"COMPANY INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement, in
each case to the extent actually and reasonably incurred with the approval of
the indemnifying party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld
(the "COMPANY INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES") of or in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation by reason of the fact that
such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to,
or at or after the Effective Time and all Company Indemnified Liabilities
based on, or primarily arising out of, or primarily relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts
arose from or are related directly to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby), in each case to the full extent a corporation is
permitted by law to indemnify its own directors, officers and employees (the
"COMPANY INDEMNIFIED PROCEEDINGS"). In the event any Company Indemnified
Party is or becomes involved in any Company Indemnified Proceeding, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any such Company Indemnified Proceeding to each
Company Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by law upon receipt of
any undertaking contemplated by Section 145 of Delaware Law. Without limiting
the foregoing, in the event any such Company Indemnified Proceeding is
brought against any Company Indemnified Party, (i) the Company Indemnified
Parties may retain counsel of their choosing, provided, however, that such
counsel is reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Surviving Corporation,
(ii) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of such counsel for the Company
Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received, and (iii)
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will use all reasonable efforts to
assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter; provided, however, that
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for
any settlement of any claim effected without its written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any Company Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this   -55-     SECTION 5.28(a)
upon becoming aware of any such Company Indemnified Proceeding shall promptly
notify Parent and the Surviving Corporation (but the failure to so notify
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving
Corporation from any liability it may have under this SECTION 5.28(a) except
to the extent such failure materially prejudices Parent or the
Surviving Corporation), and shall deliver to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation the undertaking contemplated by Section 145 of Delaware Law. The
Company Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm, which
law firm shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, to represent them with
respect to each such Company Indemnified Proceeding unless there is, under
applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant
issue between the positions of any two or more Company Indemnified Parties,
in which case, Parent shall only pay an amount equal to the aggregate
reasonable fees and expenses of all of the Company Indemnified Parties
divided by the number of law firms, each of which must be reasonably
acceptable to Parent, engaged by the Company Indemnified Parties on such
Company Indemnified Proceeding.   (b) From and after the Effective Time and
for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, the obligations of Company pursuant to the
indemnification provisions, if any, of the Company\'s certificate of
incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof. The Surviving
Corporation\'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws will contain
provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least
as favorable to the indemnified parties thereunder as those contained in the
Company\'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the
date hereof, which provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Date in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights of individuals who, at any time prior
to the Effective Time, were indemnified parties thereunder, except as
required by applicable law.   (c) Parent\'s and the Surviving
Corporation\'s respective obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b) above: (i)
shall be subject to any limitation imposed by applicable law, (ii) shall be
subject to any limitations that would be imposed by Section 145 of Delaware
Law or otherwise by Delaware Law on a corporation seeking to indemnify its
own directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates, (iii) shall not
apply to any action, suit, proceeding, complaint, claim or demand by Parent,
whether such claim is brought pursuant to this Agreement, applicable law or
otherwise, (iv) shall not apply to any Company Indemnified Liability that
result from actions, events or circumstances that would constitute a knowing
breach by the Company of any its representations, warranties or covenants in
this Agreement, any Related Agreement or any document or instrument delivered
hereunder and (v) shall not be deemed to release any Stockholder who is also
an officer, director, employee, agent or affiliate of the Company from his or
her indemnity obligations under ARTICLE VII.   (d) This section will be
binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors
and assigns and will be enforceable by the officers and directors of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time as third party beneficiaries
hereof.     -56-   5.29 TAX MATTERS. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company
agrees that it will not take, or fail to take, any action (including the
failure to merge the Surviving Corporation with and into Parent) which would
reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   5.30
TAX CERTIFICATE. To the extent requested by Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati,
Professional Corporation, counsel to Parent and Sub, and/or Testa, Hurwitz and
Thibeault, LLP, counsel to the Company, the parties hereto shall provide
customary representations, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the requesting counsel, on which such counsel may rely in rendering a
tax opinion, if any, in connection with the Merger and any subsequent merger
of the Surviving Corporation with and into Parent, with Parent continuing as
the Surviving Corporation.   5.31 SHARE CONSIDERATION/CASH CONSIDERATION
ADJUSTMENT. In the event that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued directly to the Stockholders in the Merger (including shares placed
into the Share Escrow Fund on behalf of the Stockholders but excluding any
shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, warrants or rights
assumed in the Merger) such number of shares, the "DIRECTLY ISSUED SHARES")
exceeds 20% of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock actually
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "SHARE LIMIT") as a
result of changes in the capitalization of Company between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time (including changes in the number of
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock), the parties agree
to appropriately adjust the amount of Share Consideration and Cash
Consideration so that the number of Directly Issued Shares does not exceed
the Share Limit. Such adjustment shall be determined in good faith by the
parties using the Fair Market Value of the Parent Common Stock at the
Effective Time.   ARTICLE VI  CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER   6.1 CONDITIONS

satisfaction, at or prior to the Effective Time, of the

otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger.   (c) NO INJUNCTIONS OR
RESTRAINTS; ILLEGALITY. No temporary restraining order, preliminary or

Company:   (a) REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS. (i)
The representations and warranties of Parent and Sub in this Agreement (other
than the representations and warranties of Parent and Sub as of a specified
date, which shall be true and correct as of such date) shall have been true
and correct when made and shall be true and correct in all material respects
on and as of the Closing Date as though such representations and warranties
were made on and as of such time, except for such failures to be true and
correct which in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a

performed and complied in all material respects with all covenants and
obligations under this Agreement required to be performed and complied with
by such parties as of the Closing Date.   (b) CERTIFICATE OF PARENT.

and Sub as of a specified date, which true and correct as of such date) were
true and correct on the date they were made and are true and correct in all
material respects on and as of the Closing Date as though such
representations and warranties were made on and as of such time; and   (ii)
all covenants and obligations under this Agreement to be performed by Parent

transactions contemplated hereby.   (d) NO MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT. There
shall not have occurred any event or condition of any character that has had
or is reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect since the

to the Company and Parent.   ARTICLE VII   SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES; ESCROW   7.1 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND
COVENANTS. The representations and warranties of the Company contained in
this Agreement, or in any certificate or other instruments delivered pursuant
to this Agreement, shall survive for a period of twelve (12) months following
the Closing Date (the expiration of such twelve (12) month period, the
"Survival Date"). The representations and warranties of Parent and Sub
contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate or other instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall terminate at the Closing.   7.2
INDEMNIFICATION. The Stockholders agree, severally and not jointly,
to indemnify and hold Parent, the Surviving Corporation, their direct and
indirect Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents and affiliates, (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES"), harmless against all
claims, losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses of investigation and
defense and diminution in value (hereinafter individually a "LOSS" and
collectively "LOSSES") incurred or sustained by any of the Indemnified
Parties, directly or indirectly, as a result of (i) any breach or inaccuracy
of a representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement,
in any Related Agreement or in any certificate or other instruments delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) any failure by the Company to perform or
comply with any covenant applicable to it contained in this Agreement or any
Related Agreement, (iii) any Dissenting Share Payments, (iv) any Stockholder
claims relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (v) any Excess Third Party Expenses, or (vi) any breach
or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in SECTION 2.10 of
this Agreement with respect to any Sales Taxes (as defined in SECTION 7.3(b)
hereof), without regard to any information provided by the Company in
the Disclosure Schedule regarding Sales Taxes; provided, however, with
respect to CLAUSE (vi), that any Sales Taxes giving rise to such Losses were
initiated by a tax authority upon an audit or pursuant to some other formal
proceeding and Parent used reasonable efforts to defend the Company\'s prior
position with respect to such Sales Taxes. The Stockholders shall not have
any right of contribution from the Surviving Corporation or   
-62-  Parent with respect to any Loss claimed by an Indemnified Party. For
purposes of this ARTICLE VII, holders of Company Options shall also be
considered Stockholders.   7.3 ESCROW ARRANGEMENTS.   (a) ESCROW FUNDS.
By virtue of this Agreement and as security for the indemnity obligations
provided for in SECTION 7.2 hereof, at the Effective Time, the Stockholders
and holders of Company Options will be deemed to have received and deposited
with the Escrow Agent their pro rata portion of the Escrow Share Amount (plus
any New Shares as defined in SECTION 7.3(d)(iii) hereof) without any act of
the Stockholders. The Escrow Cash Amount will be deposited with the Escrow
Agent directly by Parent. The Escrow Amount shall be available to compensate
the Indemnified Parties for any claims by such parties for any Losses
suffered or incurred by them and for which they are entitled to recovery
under this ARTICLE VII. Promptly after the Closing, the Escrow
Amount, without any act of the Stockholders or the holders of Company
Options, will be deposited with the Escrow Agent, such deposit of the Escrow
Amount to constitute two escrow funds (the "ESCROW FUNDS") to be governed by
the terms set forth herein. The Escrow Cash Amount shall be deposited into
one of the Escrow Funds (the "CASH ESCROW FUND") and the Escrow Share Amount
shall be deposited into the other of the Escrow Funds (the "STOCK ESCROW
FUND"). For tax purposes, it is intended that the Cash Escrow Fund be
established as a grantor trust with respect to Parent and that the Stock
Escrow Fund be established as a grantor trust with respect to the
Stockholders, and the parties agree to treat and report the Escrow Funds as
such. The Escrow Agent may execute this Agreement following the date hereof
and prior to the Closing, and such later execution, if so executed after the
date hereof, shall not affect the binding nature of this Agreement as of the
date hereof between the other signatories hereto.   (b) BASKET AMOUNT.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, but subject
to SECTION 7.5 hereof, except as set forth in the second sentence of this
SECTION 7.3(b), Parent may not recover any Losses under SECTION 7.2 unless
and until one or more Officer\'s Certificates (as defined below) identifying
such Losses under SECTION 7.2 in excess of $1,500,000 in the aggregate (the
"BASKET AMOUNT") has or have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and the
Stockholder Representative as provided in SECTION 7.3(e) hereof, and such
Losses are (x) agreed to by the Stockholder Representative, (y) not
subject to an Objection Notice, validly delivered in accordance with the
provisions of SECTION 7.3(f) hereof or (z) determined to be subject to
indemnification pursuant to SECTION 7.3(g) hereof, in which case Parent shall
be entitled to recover all Losses so identified, including the Basket Amount.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be entitled to recover for, and
the Basket Amount shall not apply as a threshold to, any and all claims or
payments made with respect to (A) Losses resulting from any Dissenting Share
Payments, (B) Excess Third Party Expenses, (C) Losses relating to Stockholder
claims relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (D) Losses resulting from any breach or inaccuracy
of any representation or warranty contained in SECTION 2.10 of this Agreement
with respect to any sales, use, excise, transfer, or similar taxes ("SALES
TAXES"), without regard to any information provided by the Company in the
Disclosure Schedule regarding Sales Taxes; provided, however, that any Sales
Taxes giving rise to such Losses were initiated by a tax   
-63-  authority upon an audit or pursuant to some other formal proceeding
and Parent used reasonable efforts to defend the Company\'s prior position
with respect to such Sales Taxes. For the purposes hereof, "OFFICER\'S
CERTIFICATE" shall mean a certificate signed by any executive officer of
Parent: (1) stating that Parent has paid, sustained, incurred, or properly
accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain, incur,
or accrue Losses, and (2) specifying in reasonable detail the individual
items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was
paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or the basis for such
anticipated liability, and, in the case of Losses being indemnified pursuant
to SECTION 7.3(a), the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
covenant to which such item is related.   (c) ESCROW PERIOD; DISTRIBUTION
UPON TERMINATION OF ESCROW PERIODS. Subject to the following requirements,
the Escrow Funds shall be in existence immediately following the Effective
Time and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., local time at Parent\'s headquarters,
on the Survival Date (the "ESCROW PERIOD"); provided, however, that the
Escrow Period shall not terminate with respect to any amount which, in the
reasonable judgment of Parent, is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims
specified in any Officer\'s Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent and the
Stockholder Representative prior to the Escrow Period termination date with
respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to the Survival Date (the
"ESCROW CLAIMS AMOUNT"). Any portion of the Escrow Funds not subject to the
Escrow Claims Amount shall be delivered to the Stockholders within ten (10)
business days after the Survival Date. As soon as any such claims covered by
the Escrow Claims Amount have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver
to the Stockholders within ten (10) business days after notification of such
resolution the remaining portion of the Escrow Funds, if any, not required to
satisfy such claims. Deliveries of the Escrow Amount out of the Escrow Funds
to the Stockholders pursuant to this SECTION 7.3(c) shall be made in
proportion to their respective pro rata portions of the Escrow
Amount remaining in the Escrow Funds.   (d) PROTECTION OF ESCROW FUNDS.  
(i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Funds during the
Escrow Period, shall treat each such fund as a trust fund in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and not as the property of Parent and shall hold
and dispose of the Escrow Funds only in accordance with the terms of this
Article VII.   (ii) The cash proceeds in the Cash Escrow Fund shall
be invested in U.S. Treasury bills with maturities of not more than thirty
(30) days and any interest paid on such Escrow Cash Amount shall be added to
the Cash Escrow Fund, and become a part thereof. For any period of time
before such U.S. Treasury bills can be purchased by the Escrow Agent or after
such bills mature, the Escrow Cash Amount shall be invested in a business
money market account of the Escrow Agent (or another nationally recognized
banking institution) and any interest paid on such Escrow Cash Amount shall
be added to the Cash Escrow Fund and become a part thereof. Any interest
earned on the proceeds of the Cash Escrow Fund shall be treated as owned by
Parent and Parent shall report such interest ("CASH ESCROW INCOME") as income
of Parent. The Cash Escrow Income shall be paid by Parent to the Stockholders
on a pro rata basis and, for federal income tax    -64-  purposes, shall
be treated as an interest payment from Parent to the Stockholders in respect
of the obligation of Parent to pay the Escrow Cash Amount to the Stockholders
as additional consideration in the future; provided, however, that for
administrative ease, the Cash Escrow Income shall be added to, and become a
part of, the Cash Escrow Fund and such amount shall be distributed to the
Stockholders in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE VII.   (iii) Any
shares of Parent Common Stock or other equity securities issued or
distributed by Parent after the Effective Time (including shares issued upon
a stock split) ("NEW SHARES") in respect of Parent Common Stock in the Stock
Escrow Fund which have not been released from the Stock Escrow Fund shall be
added to the Stock Escrow Fund and become a part thereof. New Shares issued
in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock which have been released from the
Stock Escrow Fund shall not be added to the Stock Escrow Fund but shall be
distributed to the record holders thereof. Cash dividends on Parent Common
Stock shall not be added to the Stock Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to
the record holders thereof.   (iv) Each of the Stockholders shall have
voting rights with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock contributed
to and held in the Stock Escrow Fund by such Stockholder (and on any voting
securities added to the Stock Escrow Fund in respect of such shares of Parent
Common Stock).   (e) CLAIMS FOR INDEMNIFICATION.   (i) Upon receipt by the
Escrow Agent at any time on or before the last day of the Escrow Period of an
Officer\'s Certificate related to a claim for indemnification pursuant to
SECTION 7.2, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of SECTION
7.3(f), SECTION 7.3(g) and SECTION 7.3(h) hereof, deliver to Parent, as
promptly as practicable, Parent Common Stock held in the Stock Escrow Fund
(as valued based on the average closing sale price of one share of Parent
Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten (10)
consecutive trading days ending three (3) trading days immediately preceding
the date of payment for such Loss ("ESCROW TRADING PRICE")) and cash held in
the Cash Escrow Fund equal, in the aggregate, to such Losses. Subject
to SECTION 7.5 hereof, claims against the Escrow Funds shall be satisfied pro
rata from the Escrow Amount deposited in the Escrow Funds on behalf of
each Stockholder, and, to the extent cash was deposited in the Cash Escrow
Fund on behalf of a Stockholder, such Stockholder\'s pro rata contribution to
satisfy any claims shall first be satisfied out of such Stockholder\'s pro
rata portion of the Cash Escrow Fund and upon depletion of such cash, or in
the event that no cash was deposited into the Cash Escrow Fund on behalf of
such Stockholder, such claims shall then be satisfied out of the
Stockholder\'s pro rata portion of the Stock Escrow Fund.   (ii) Failure by
the Stockholder Representative to object in writing within the 30-day period
after delivery by Parent of the Officer\'s Certificate shall be an
irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative and the
Stockholders that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the
claim for Losses set forth in such Officer\'s Certificate.    -65-   (f)
OBJECTIONS TO CLAIMS FOR INDEMNIFICATION. At the time of delivery of any
Officer\'s Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such
certificate shall be delivered to the Stockholder Representative, and for
a period of thirty (30) days after receipt by the Stockholder Representative
of such Officer\'s Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery to
Parent of any Escrow Claims Amount pursuant to SECTION 7.3(e) hereof unless
the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the
Stockholder Representative to make such delivery. After the expiration of
such thirty (30) day period, the Escrow Agent shall make delivery of cash or
shares of Parent Common Stock, as required by SECTION 7.3(e), from the Escrow
Funds, equal to the amount of Losses claimed in the Officer\'s Certificate;
provided, however, that no such payment or delivery may be made if the
Stockholder Representative shall object in a written statement to the claim
made in the Officer\'s Certificate (an "OBJECTION NOTICE"), and such
Objection Notice shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the
expiration of such thirty (30) day period.   (g) RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS;
ARBITRATION.   (i) In case the Stockholder Representative delivers
an Objection Notice in accordance with SECTION 7.3(f), the
Stockholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree
upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such
claims. If the Stockholder Representative and Parent should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both
parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from the
Escrow Funds in accordance with the terms thereof.   (ii) If no such
agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior to thirty
(30) days after delivery of an Objection Notice, either Parent or the
Stockholder Representative may demand arbitration of the matter unless the
amount of the Loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in
which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is
ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration, and in either such
event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by one arbitrator
mutually agreeable to Parent and the Stockholder Representative. In the event
that, within thirty (30) days after submission of any dispute to arbitration,
Parent and the Stockholder Representative cannot mutually agree on one
arbitrator, then, within fifteen (15) days after the end of such thirty (30)
day period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall each select one
arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator.
If a party fails to select an arbitrator during this fifteen (15) day period,
then the parties agree that the arbitration will be conducted by the
arbitrator selected by the other party.   (iii) Any such arbitration shall
be held in Wilmington, Delaware, under the rules then in effect of the
American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator(s) shall determine how all
expenses relating to the arbitration shall be paid, including without
limitation, the respective expenses of each party, the fees of each
arbitrator and the administrative fee of the American Arbitration
Association. The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a
limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and
time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the
sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three   
-66-  arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover relevant information from
the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator,
or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon
motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose
sanctions, including attorneys\' fees and costs, to the same extent as a
competent court of law or equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the
three arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that discovery was sought
without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected
to without substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator or a
majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and
amount of any claim in such Officer\'s Certificate shall be final, binding,
and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement. Such decision shall be
written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions
which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the
arbitrator(s), and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and make
distributions from the Escrow Funds in accordance with, the terms of such
award, judgment, decree or order as applicable. Within thirty (30) days of a
decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another, such
party shall make the payment to such other party.   (iv) Judgment upon any
award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction. The forgoing arbitration provision shall apply to any dispute
among the Stockholders and the Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE VII
hereof, whether relating to claims upon the Escrow Funds or to the other
indemnification obligations set forth in this ARTICLE VII.   (h) THIRD PARTY
CLAIMS. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third party claim (a "THIRD
PARTY CLAIM") which Parent reasonably believes may result in a demand against
the Escrow Funds or for other indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VII,
Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative of such claim, and the
Stockholder Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the Stockholders,
at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the
defense of such Third Party Claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole
discretion, in close consultation with the Stockholder Representative, to
conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim; provided,
however, that except with the consent of the Stockholder Representative, no
settlement of any such Third Party Claim with third party claimants shall be
determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter. In the event
that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any such settlement, the
Stockholders shall have no power or authority to object under any provision
of this ARTICLE VII to the amount of any Third Party Claim by Parent against
the Escrow Funds or against the Stockholders directly, as the case may be,
with respect to such settlement.   (i) ESCROW AGENT\'S DUTIES.   (i) The
Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as
are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any additional written
escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive after the date of this
Agreement which are signed by an executive officer of Parent and the
Stockholder Representative, and may rely and shall be protected in relying or
refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine
and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The
Escrow Agent shall not be    -67-  liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of
reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith.   (ii) The
Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all warnings
given by any of the parties hereto or by any other person, excepting only
orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to
comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court. In case the
Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any
court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or
to any other person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such
order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled,
set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction.  
(iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the
identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or
purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers
deposited or called for hereunder.   (iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be
liable for the expiration of any rights under any statute of limitations with
respect to this Agreement or any documents deposited with the Escrow
Agent.   (v) In performing any duties under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for damages, losses, or
expenses, except for negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any
act or failure to act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken
or omitted in reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement
or affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in
good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or
responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of
any representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with
legal counsel in connection with performing the Escrow Agent\'s duties under
this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or
permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel.
The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying the
authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party to
this Agreement.   (vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to
this Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of
this Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be
required to determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The
Escrow Agent may hold all documents and the Escrow Amount and may wait for
settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or
other means as, in the Escrow Agent\'s discretion, may be required, despite
what may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow
Agent will not be liable for damages. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at
its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer
and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is
authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and the
Escrow Amounts held in escrow, except all costs, expenses, charges and   
-68-  reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the
interpleader action (the "AGENT INTERPLEADER EXPENSES") and which the parties
agree to pay as follows: fifty percent (50%) to be paid by Parent and fifty
percent (50%) to be paid by the Stockholders on the basis of the
Stockholders\' respective pro rata portions; provided, however, that in the
event any Stockholder fails to timely pay his or her pro rata portion of the
Agent Interpleader Expenses, the parties agree that Parent may at its option
pay such Stockholder\'s pro rata portion of the Agent Interpleader Expenses
and recover an equal amount (which shall be deemed a Loss) from such
Stockholder\'s pro rata portion of the Escrow Funds. Upon initiating such
action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from
all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.  
(vii) The parties and their respective successors and assigns agree jointly
and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable
costs of investigation, counsel fees, including allocated costs of in-house
counsel and disbursements that may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by
Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of his/her duties under this
Agreement, including but not limited to any litigation arising from this
Agreement or involving its subject matter, other than those arising out
of the negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent (the
"AGENT INDEMNIFICATION EXPENSES") as follows: fifty percent (50%) to be paid
by Parent and fifty percent (50%) to be paid by the Stockholders on the basis
of the Stockholders\' pro rata portions; provided, however, that in the event
any Stockholder fails to timely pay his or her pro rata portion of the
Agent Indemnification Expenses, the parties agree that Parent may at its
option pay such Stockholder\'s pro rata portion of the Agent Indemnification
Expenses and recover an equal amount (which shall be deemed a Loss) from such
Stockholder\'s pro rata portion of the Escrow Funds.   (viii) The Escrow
Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty (30) days written
notice to Parent and the Stockholder Representative; provided, however, that
no such resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a
successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as follows: Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
mutually agree on a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after
receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor escrow
agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint a
successor escrow agent authorized to do business in the State of California.
The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting
such appointment and it shall, without further acts, be vested with all the
estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow
agent as if originally named as escrow agent. Upon appointment of a successor
escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any further duties
and liability under this Agreement.   (j) FEES. All fees of the Escrow Agent
for performance of its duties hereunder shall be paid by Parent in accordance
with the standard fee schedule of the Escrow Agent. It is understood that the
fees and usual charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be
considered compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this
Agreement. In the event that the conditions of this Agreement are not
promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow Agent renders any    -69-  service
not provided for in this Agreement but that has been requested by an officer
of Parent, or if the parties request a substantial modification of the terms
of the Agreement, or if any controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent
is made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to the Escrow
Funds or their subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably
compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs,
attorney\'s fees, including allocated costs of in-house counsel, and expenses
occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or litigation.   (k)
SUCCESSOR ESCROW AGENTS. Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent in its
individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion
or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall
be a party, or any corporation to which substantially all the corporate
trust business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be
transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without
further act.   7.4 STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE.   (a) By virtue of the
approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the requisite vote of the
Stockholders, each of the Stockholders shall be deemed to have agreed to
appoint Jeffrey R. Beir as its agent and attorney-in-act, as the Stockholder
Representative for and on behalf of the Stockholders to give and receive
notices and communications, to authorize payment to any Indemnified Party
from the Escrow Funds in satisfaction of claims by any Indemnified Party, to
object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements
and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts
and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply
with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to, any other
claim by any Indemnified Party against any Stockholder or by any such
Stockholder against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any
Indemnified Party and any such Stockholder, in each case relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other
actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii)
specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be
changed by the Stockholders from time to time upon not less than thirty (30)
days prior written notice to Parent; provided, however, that the Stockholder
Representative may not be removed unless during the Escrow Period (and any
extension thereof) holders of a two-thirds interest of the Escrow Funds agree
to such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. A vacancy in
the position of Stockholder Representative may be filled by the holders of a
majority in interest of the Escrow Funds. No bond shall be required of the
Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall not
receive any compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or
from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from
the Stockholders.   (b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable
for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while
acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The
Stockholders on whose behalf the Escrow Amounts were contributed to the
Escrow    -70-  Funds shall indemnify the Stockholder Representative and
hold the Stockholder Representative harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Stockholder Representative\'s duties
hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel
retained by the Stockholder Representative ("STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE
EXPENSES"). A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative, including but not limited to an amendment, extension or
waiver of this Agreement pursuant to SECTION 8.3 and SECTION 8.4 hereof,
shall constitute a decision of the Stockholders and shall be final, binding
and conclusive upon the Stockholders; and the Escrow Agent and Parent may
rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Stockholders. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any
liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative.  
(c) By their approval of this Agreement, the Stockholders shall be deemed to
have waived any claims they may have or assert, including those that may
arise in the future, against the Stockholder Representative, and any of
its affiliates, for any action or inaction taken or not taken by the
Stockholder Representative in connection herewith, except to the extent that
any such claims arise out of the Stockholder Representative\'s gross
negligence or bad faith.   7.5 MAXIMUM PAYMENTS; REMEDY.   (a) The
provisions of this ARTICLE VII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of (and
corresponding liability of the Stockholders to) Parent, Sub and the Surviving
Corporation for any damage, claim, cause of action or right of any nature
