PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT

  

  

This Purchase and Sale Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of June 26, 2018 by and between DXC Technology Company, a Nevada
corporation ("Buyer"), and Molina Healthcare, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Seller") (each a "Party" and, together, the "Parties").

  

  

RECITALS

  

  

A. Seller owns 100% of the outstanding equity interests (the "Equity
Interests") of Molina Information Systems, LLC, a California limited liability
company doing business as Molina Medicaid Solutions (the "Company").

  

  

B. Buyer desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell, assign,
transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer, free and clear of all Liens other than
Permitted Encumbrances, all of its right, title and interest in and to the
Equity Interests on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

  

  

AGREEMENT

  

  

In consideration of the terms hereof, the Parties agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE 1. 
  PURCHASE AND SALE OF EQUITY INTERESTS

  

  

    

1.1

  |  

Purchase and Sale of Equity Interests

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing,
Buyer agrees to purchase the Equity Interests from Seller, and Seller agrees
to sell the Equity Interests to Buyer, free and clear of all Liens other than
Permitted Encumbrances.

  

  

    

1.2

  |  

Consideration for Equity Interests

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

As consideration for Buyer's purchase of the Equity Interests, Buyer shall pay
to Seller at the Closing by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the accounts designated in writing by Seller at least three (3) business days
prior to the Closing Date an aggregate amount in cash equal to the net sum of
the following (as subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section_ 1.3, the
"Purchase Price"):

  

  

(a) $266,000,000;

  

  

(b) minus the amount of any Estimated Adjustment Items outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Closing;

  

  

(c) plus the Estimated Company Cash;

  

  

(d) plus the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital is
greater than the Target Net Working Capital; and

  

  

(e) minus the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital is
less than the Target Net Working Capital.

  

    

   

  

    

1.3

  |  

Purchase Price Adjustments

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(a) At least three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
provide Buyer with a statement (the "Estimated Adjustment Statement") showing
a good faith estimate and calculation of Adjustment Items (the "Estimated
Adjustment Items"), Company Cash (the "Estimated Company Cash") and Net
Working Capital (the "Estimated Net Working Capital"), in each case as of
immediately prior to the Closing and prepared in a manner consistent with the
calculation of the Trial Adjustment Calculation and the other practices and
methodologies set out on Schedule 1 (the "Adjustment Calculation Practices and
Methodologies"). Seller shall consider in good faith any revisions to the
Estimated Adjustment Statement and the components thereof proposed by Buyer,
however, if the Parties cannot reach agreement with respect to any of Buyer's
proposed revisions prior to the Closing, the amounts proposed by Seller shall
be used for purposes of the Estimated Adjustment Statement.

  

  

(b) As promptly as practicable, but in any event not later than sixty (60)
days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to
Seller a final statement (the "Final Adjustment Statement") showing Buyer's
good faith determination of Adjustment Items, Company Cash and Net Working
Capital, in each case as of immediately prior to the Closing and prepared in a
manner consistent with the calculation of the Trial Adjustment Calculation and
the Adjustment Calculation Practices and Methodologies.

  

  

(c) After delivery of the Final Adjustment Statement, Seller, together with
its accountants and advisors, shall have reasonable access (subject to the
execution of customary access letters) to the books and records of the Company
during regular business hours and all additional information used in
determining the Company's Final Adjustment Statement, and Buyer will cause its
and the Company's officers, employees and independent certified public
accountants to be reasonably available to discuss with Seller and its
representatives, such books, records and information, to verify the
computation of Adjustment Items, Company Cash and Net Working Capital set
forth in the Final Adjustment Statement. Within thirty (30) days after
Seller's receipt of the Final Adjustment Statement, Seller may deliver written
notice to Buyer of any items shown in the Final Adjustment Statement to which
Seller objects, specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such objections
(the "Dispute Notice"). If no Dispute Notice is delivered within such thirty
(30)‑day period, Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and
amounts shown in the Final Adjustment Statement, and the Adjustment Items,
Company Cash and Net Working Capital as of immediately prior to the Closing
shall be deemed to have been finally determined. If, within a further period
of twenty (20) days from the end of the aforementioned review period, the
Parties are unable to resolve matters raised by the Dispute Notice, the
Parties shall submit such matters to the Accounting Expert for resolution. In
the event that either Party fails to submit its statement regarding any items
remaining in dispute within the time determined by the Accounting Expert, then
the Accounting Expert shall render a decision based solely on the evidence
timely submitted to the Accounting Expert by the applicable Party. The
submission of the disputed items to the Accounting Expert shall be the sole
and exclusive dispute resolution mechanism for any disagreement involving such
disputed items. The Accounting Expert shall be directed to make a final
determination regarding only those items or amounts disputed by Seller in the
Dispute Notice which remain in dispute. The Accounting Expert will deliver to
the Parties a written determination (such determination to include a work
sheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such
determination and to be based solely on information provided to the Accounting
Expert by the Parties). In making its determination, the Accounting Expert
shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The determination of the
Accounting Expert shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties. Judgment
upon the determination of the Accounting Expert may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction over the Party against which such determination is to be
enforced. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed
by the Accounting Expert will be borne pro rata as between Buyer, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand, in proportion to the allocation of the
dollar value of the amounts in dispute as between Buyer, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, as finally determined by the Accounting Expert such
that the Party prevailing pays the lesser proportion of the fees and expenses.
For example, if Seller challenges the Final Adjustment Statement in the net
amount of $1,000,000, and the Accounting Expert determines that Buyer has a
valid claim for $400,000 of the $1,000,000, Buyer shall bear 60% of the fees
and expenses of the Accounting Expert and Seller shall bear the remaining 40%
of the fees and expenses.

  

  

 

-2-  

  

  

(d) If the final determination of Adjustment Items as of the Closing Date
(either pursuant to mutual agreement or by determination of the Accounting
Expert) is greater than the Estimated Adjustment Items, as set forth on the
Estimated Adjustment Statement, Seller shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer, the amount of
such excess. If the final determination of Adjustment Items as of the Closing
Date (either pursuant to mutual agreement or by determination of the
Accounting Expert) is less than the Estimated Adjustment Items as set forth on
the Estimated Adjustment Statement, then Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller,
the amount of such shortfall.

  

  

(e) If the final determination of Company Cash as of the Closing Date (either
pursuant to mutual agreement or by determination of the Accounting Expert) is
greater than the Estimated Closing Cash, as set forth on the Estimated
Adjustment Statement, Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller, the amount of
such excess. If the final determination of Company Cash as of the Closing Date
(either pursuant to mutual agreement or by determination of the Accounting
Expert) is less than the Estimated Closing Cash, as set forth on the Estimated
Adjustment Statement, then Seller shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer, the amount of
such shortfall.

  

  

(f) If the final determination of Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date
(either pursuant to mutual agreement or by determination of the Accounting
Expert) is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital, as set forth on the
Estimated Adjustment Statement, Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller, the amount of
such excess. If the final determination of Net Working Capital as of the
Closing Date (either pursuant to mutual agreement or by determination of the
Accounting Expert) is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, as set
forth on the Estimated Adjustment Statement, then Seller shall pay to Buyer,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Buyer, the amount of such shortfall.

  

  

 

-3-  

  

  

(g) Any payments due to a Party in accordance with the foregoing clauses (d)
through (f) above shall be aggregated and netted against each other such that
one payment shall be made to the applicable Party.

  

  

(h) Any adjustment made pursuant to this _Section_ 1.3 shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  

  

    

1.4

  |  

Closing

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the
transactions contemplated herein (the "Closing") shall take place at the
offices of Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP on the third (3rd) business day
after (or, at the election of Seller after consultation with Buyer, on the
last day of the month or the 15th day of the month in which) the conditions
set forth in _Articles _4 and 5 have been satisfied or waived (other than
conditions to be satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions), or such other time or place as the Parties may
agree (as applicable, the "Closing Date"). The Closing will be deemed to be
effective as of 11:59 PM PST on the Closing Date.

  

  

    

1.5

  |  

Withholding

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

Buyer, the Company and any other Person making payments on their behalf shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable in
connection with this Agreement such amounts (if any) as are required to be
deducted or withheld under the Code, or any other provision of any other Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely paid to
the applicable Governmental Body, such amounts shall be treated as having been
paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made.

  

  

ARTICLE 2. 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
  OF SELLER RELATING TO THE COMPANY

  

  

Except as is otherwise disclosed in the Disclosure Memorandum delivered by
Seller concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the

exceptions noted in the Disclosure Memorandum are numbered to correspond to
the applicable sections to which such exception refers; provided, however that
any disclosure set forth on any particular schedule shall be deemed disclosed
and incorporated into any other sections on the Disclosure Memorandum where
such disclosure would otherwise be appropriate if and to the extent the
relevance of such information to such other sections is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure.

wear and tear not caused by neglect excepted) and are reasonably suitable for
the uses to which they are being put. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.10(c)

(a) Ownership of Intellectual Property. Subject to _Section_ 6.8, the Company
owns, licenses or otherwise possesses legally transferable and enforceable
rights to use all Intellectual Property that is used in the Business. The
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not result in the
loss, suspension, limitation, termination or other impairment of, or give rise
to any right of any Person to suspend, limit, terminate or otherwise impair
the right of the Company to own or use or otherwise exercise any other rights
that the Company currently has with respect to, any Intellectual Property, nor
require the consent of any Person in respect of any such Intellectual
Property. Each item of Owned Intellectual Property is owned free and clear of
any Liens, except for Permitted Liens and non-exclusive licenses granted to
end-user customers of the Company in the Ordinary Course of Business. The
Company has not licensed any of its Owned Software in source code form or
otherwise permitted any Owned Intellectual Property that is or was material to
Company to lapse or enter into the public domain. The Company has not entered
into any exclusive licenses or agreements relating to any of its Owned
Intellectual Property with any party. No third party has a joint ownership
interest in or to any of the Owned Intellectual Property. As used in this

not registered, and all registrations thereof and applications therefor and
all goodwill associated therewith ("Trademarks").

  

  

(b) No Infringement. (i) Neither Seller nor the Company has been sued in any

dilution or other violation with respect to the Business, the Owned Software
or any other Intellectual Property rights of the Company (ii) to the Knowledge
of Seller, the conduct of the Business, including the manufacturing,
marketing, licensing and sale of the Company's products and service offerings,
does not infringe, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate, any
Intellectual Property of any third party, and (iii) the Company not brought

involving Intellectual Property against any third party.

  

  

(c) Third Party Infringement. To the Knowledge of Seller, no Person is
infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating any Intellectual
Property rights of the Company.

  

  

(d) Proprietary Information Agreements. Copies of the Company's current

former employees of the Company (and its predecessors) have executed, or will
execute prior to the Closing, such form employee confidentiality agreement (or
substantially such form in all material respects), or another agreement
pursuant to which the applicable employee has agreed to appropriate
confidentiality and non-disclosure covenants. All current and former
contractors of the Company (and its predecessors) who have been involved in
the creation or development of the Owned Software or any other Intellectual
Property for the Company or its predecessors have executed such form
contractor agreement (or substantially such form in all material respects), or
another agreement pursuant to which the applicable contractor has (i) assigned

right, title, interest or other claim to any Owned Intellectual Property or
Owned Software. The Company has taken commercially reasonable measures to
protect the confidentiality of confidential information and trade secrets used
or held for use in the Business. To the Knowledge of Seller, there has been no
unauthorized use or disclosure of any such confidential information or trade
secrets.

or resources provided under customer contracts with states.

  

  

(f) Open Source Software. Schedule 2.17(f) of the Disclosure Memorandum lists

License, the Sun Community Source License (SCSL) the Sun Industry Standards
License (SISL) and the Apache License) (collectively, "Open Source Software")

(h) Protection of Personally Identifiable Information. In its conduct of the
Business, the Company is in compliance in all material respects with
applicable privacy and security policies and other obligations set forth in
the Contracts and applicable Information Privacy or Security Laws regarding
the collection, use, transmission, storage, access, disclosure and disposal of
such third parties' Personally Identifiable Information or health records, and
the Company has obtained all necessary consents to the collection, use or
disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information in connection with the
conduct of the Business. When the Company is acting as a "business associate"
as such term is defined under HIPAA, the Company has implemented the requisite
privacy and security policies, procedures and systems to comply with the terms
of its business associate agreements and as required by applicable Information
Privacy or Security Laws, and the Company is not and has not been in material
breach of any such business associate agreement. The Company contractually
requires all third parties, including vendors, that have access to or receive
Personally Identifiable Information on behalf of the Company to comply with
all applicable Laws regarding the use of such Personally Identifiable
Information and to use commercially reasonable efforts to protect such
Personally Identifiable Information against unauthorized access or use. The
Company has, in its conduct of the Business, taken commercially reasonable
measures to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to
protect Personally Identifiable Information against loss and against
unauthorized access, use, modification, disclosure or other misuse, including
all necessary risk analyses required by 45 C.F.R. § 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A).
There has been no loss, unauthorized or illegal access, use, processing or
disclosure of that Personally Identifiable Information in the Company's
conduct of the Business that has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected
to result in (individually or in the aggregate), material liability to the
Company, including, but not limited to, any "breach" or successful "security
incident" as such terms are defined under HIPAA. The Company is not nor has
been under investigation, audit or proceedings by any Governmental Body or
received any Claim from any third party, individual or Governmental Body
related to whether the Company's collection, processing, use, storage,
security and/or disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information (i) is in
violation of any applicable Information Privacy or Security Laws, privacy
policies or security policies or (ii) otherwise constitutes an unfair,
deceptive or misleading trade practice. "Personally Identifiable Information"
means any information that alone or together with any other data or
information can be used to identify an individual. Neither the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transaction consummated by this Agreement will result in any violation of the
provisions of this Section.

(i) IT Assets. The computers, software, servers, workstations, routers, hubs,
switches, circuits, networks, data communications lines and all other

respects in accordance with their documentation and functional specifications
and otherwise as required by the Company and have not materially malfunctioned
or failed within the Relevant Period, (ii) to the Knowledge of Seller, do not
contain any virus, worm, software lock, drop dead device, time bomb or any
similar destructive codes or instructions, and (iii) to the Knowledge of
Seller, comply with the terms of all required contractual obligations of the
Company. The Company has in place commercially reasonable measures, consistent
with current industry standards, designed to protect the confidentiality,
integrity and security of the IT Assets (and all information and transactions
stored or contained therein or transmitted thereby) against any unauthorized
use, access, interruption, modification or corruption. The Company has
implemented commercially reasonable data backup, data storage, system
redundancy and disaster avoidance and recovery procedures, as well as a
commercially reasonable business continuity plan, designed to enable the
Company to continue to conduct the Business if there were a significant
malfunction, failure or other interruption of or damage to or corruption or
destruction of any of the IT Assets. In the Relevant Period, there has not
been any material security breach of or material unauthorized access to the IT
Assets (including any data stored or contained therein or transmitted
thereby).

Buyer with all financial, operating and other data and information as Buyer,
through its officers, employees or agents, may reasonably request; provided,
however, that Seller shall have the right to have a representative present,
Buyer shall consult with Seller regarding the topics for discussion at any
meetings with customers or suppliers and Seller shall not be required to
provide access to any information that is (a) subject to attorney client
privilege to the extent doing so would cause such privilege to be waived, (b)
prohibited by applicable Law or (c) subject to contractual prohibitions
against disclosure to the extent doing so would violate such prohibition;
provided that to the extent any information is not made available due to
circumstances set forth in the foregoing clauses (a) - (c), the Parties shall
cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information
without breaching confidentiality obligations or losing the ability to
maintain attorney-client work product privilege or similar claims of privilege
(the exceptions set forth in the foregoing clauses (a) - (c) and the
obligations in the proviso following clauses (a) - (c), the "Disclosure
Exceptions"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none
of Seller or its Affiliates (including the Company) shall be required to

affiliated or unitary tax return which includes Seller or any of its
Affiliates or any tax-related work papers, except, in each case, for materials

agents, may reasonably request in respect of the Business, in each case,
subject to the Disclosure Exceptions and solely to the extent that such
information is reasonably required for a legitimate business purpose.

Further Action; Commercially Reasonable Efforts

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof (but subject to the
provisions of _Sections_ 6.3(g), 6.3(f) and 6.3(g)), each Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby, including using commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) obtain all waivers, licenses, permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders of any Governmental Body and parties
to contracts with the Company as are necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) finalize the Transition Services
Agreement, including the schedules and exhibits thereto, in accordance with

Disclosure Memorandum in breach of the representations and warranties set
forth in _Section 2.25_ and (iv) discuss the Commingled Contracts, including
the contents thereof, in connection with determining that post-Closing the
Company has the Contracts required to operate the Business. In case at any
time after the Closing any further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement or the other Operative Documents, each
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly take all such
action. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of any event
that would likely be expected to affect Buyer's ability to pay the Purchase
Price at the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, subject to Seller providing Buyer a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment, Buyer agrees to provide its written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) to an amendment to
the TriZetto Contract (the "TriZetto Amendment"); provided the TriZetto
Amendment shall be in accordance with the principles set forth on Schedule
6.3(a)(ii)(y).

  

  

(b) If any Person has initiated or threatened to initiate a legal proceeding
that seeks to restrain, alter, delay or prohibit, or any order is entered that
has the effect of restraining, altering, delaying or prohibiting, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Parties
shall cooperate to use their commercially reasonable efforts to resist,
resolve or defend such legal proceeding or have such order vacated subject, in
each case (and for the avoidance of doubt), subject to the provisions of
_Sections_ 6.3(f) and 6.3(g).

  

  

(c) Each Party shall promptly inform the other of, and furnish to the other
Party copies of, any communication, correspondence or filing received by such
Party from any Governmental Body regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If any Party or any of its Affiliates receives
a request for additional information or documentary material from any such
Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then such Party shall, or shall cause such Affiliate to, as soon as
reasonably practicable, but after providing the other Party with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment, deliver an appropriate response to the
applicable Governmental Body in compliance with such request. Neither Party
shall participate, or cause or permit its Affiliates to participate, in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Body in respect of any
filings, investigations or inquiries concerning the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Body, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting. This clause (c) is
limited to the extent compliance would be in violation of applicable Law.

  

  

 

-31-  

  

  

(d) Each Party shall promptly file or cause to be filed all filings with
Governmental Bodies required in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including (i) filing as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof, and in any event within fifteen (15) business days of
the date hereof, all required filings under the HSR Act, and (ii) submissions
of additional information requested by the FTC, DOJ, state attorney general or
any other Governmental Body. Each of the Parties further agrees that it shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, comply with any other required post-Closing
notification or other requirements of any antitrust, trade competition,
investment or control reporting or similar Law of any Governmental Body with
competent jurisdiction. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with and
promptly to consult with, to provide any reasonably available information with
respect to, and to provide, subject to appropriate confidentiality provisions,
copies of all presentations and filings to any Governmental Body to the other
party or its counsel. Each Party agrees not to extend any waiting period under
the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Body not to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except with the
prior written consent of the other Party.

  

  

(e) In addition to the agreements set forth in clause (d) above in respect of
the HSR Act (which shall be governed solely by clause (d) above), prior to the
Closing, the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
any other consents from the Governmental Bodies or third parties are obtained
as promptly as practicable and that any reasonable conditions set forth in or
established by any such consents from Governmental Bodies or third parties are
satisfied in all material respects and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Seller in connection therewith; provided, however,
that such efforts shall not require Seller to make or agree to make any
material undertaking, or to agree to any material condition, in connection
with its efforts to obtain such consents that is effective prior to the
Closing or that applies to any of Seller's operations other than the Company;
provided further that Buyer's obligation to use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Seller shall not require Buyer or any Affiliate
thereof to make any out-of-pocket expenditures or agree to any material
undertaking or condition in connection with securing any such consent.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall Buyer or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to
propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, enter into any
consent decree, make any divestiture, accept any operational restriction or
take or commit to take any action that would reasonably be expected to limit:
(i) the freedom of action of Buyer or its subsidiaries or Affiliates with
respect to the operation of, or Buyer's ability to retain, the Company, or
(ii) Buyer's or its subsidiaries' or Affiliates' ability to retain, own or
operate any portion of the businesses, product lines or assets of Buyer or any
of its subsidiaries or Affiliates, or alter or restrict in any way the
business or commercial practices of Buyer or its subsidiaries or Affiliates.

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall Seller or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to
propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, enter into any
consent decree, make any divestiture, accept any operational restriction or
take or commit to take any action that would reasonably be expected to limit
Seller or its subsidiaries or Affiliates ability to retain, own or operate any
portion of the businesses, product lines or assets of Seller or any of its
subsidiaries or Affiliates, or alter or restrict in any way the business or
commercial practices of Seller or its subsidiaries or Affiliates.

Publicity

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

No press release or other public announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be issued by Seller or Buyer without the
prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as such release or
announcement may be required by applicable Law or stock exchange rule, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall, to
the extent permitted by Law, allow the other party reasonable time to comment
on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing shall prohibit any disclosure as is permitted in the Mutual
Non-Disclosure Agreement.

Tax Matters

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties shall evenly
split all sales, use, documentary, stamp, registration and/or transfer Taxes,
and other similar Taxes, if any (but in each case, excluding any Taxes with
respect to income, profits or gains), imposed in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Company shall file or cause
to be filed all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
all such documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and/or transfer Taxes
and fees, and if required by applicable Law, the Parties shall join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. Such sales, use,
documentary, stamp, registration and/or transfer Taxes, and such other similar
Taxes, shall not be taken into account in determining the Net Working Capital
of the Company pursuant to _Section_ 1.3.

  

  

(b) The Parties agree to treat the acquisition of the Equity Interests
pursuant to this Agreement for applicable income tax purposes as an
acquisition of assets, and agree to report the transaction for applicable
income tax purposes in a manner consistent with such treatment unless
otherwise required by a taxing authority. The Parties agree to cooperate in
the preparation of a joint allocation schedule which allocates the Purchase
Price among such acquired assets and the covenants contained in _Section_ 6.9,
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. If the Parties are unable to
agree on the allocation schedule within one hundred eighty (180) days
following the Closing Date, then each of Buyer and Seller may prepare its own
allocation schedule in a manner each believes appropriate which allocates the
Purchase Price among the acquired assets and the covenants contained in
_Section 6.9_. The Parties shall each file their respective Tax Returns in
accordance with either the agreed upon allocation schedule or their
respectively prepared allocation schedule in the event the Parties were unable
to agree on the allocation schedule.

  

  

 

-33-  

  

  

(c) Seller shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns of the
Company for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and for
Straddle Periods (all such Tax Returns, "Seller Prepared Tax Returns") in a
manner consistent with past practice of the Company, except as required by
applicable Law. Seller shall deliver to Buyer a draft of each such Seller
Prepared Tax Return at least fifteen (15) days before the date such Seller
Prepared Tax Return is required to be filed (taking into account any
applicable extensions), shall permit the Buyer to review and comment on each
such Seller Prepared Tax Return prior to filing and shall consider in good
faith all reasonable comments made by Buyer to Seller in writing at least five
(5) days before filing. In the event that Seller does not accept such comments
made by Buyer, any dispute not resolved by the time of filing shall be
submitted to the Accountant Expert for resolution in the manner set forth in
_Section 1.3(c)_. If a Tax Return is required by applicable Law to be filed
before the Accounting Expert has resolved the disputed items (taking into
account valid extensions of time within which to file, which shall be obtained
to the extent necessary to permit the resolution of disputed items), the Tax
Return shall be filed as prepared by Seller and shall be amended if necessary
to reflect the determination of the Accounting Expert with respect to the
disputed items. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, (i) Seller shall not provide to Buyer any
income or other Tax Returns of Seller or any Affiliated Group of which Seller
or any of its Affiliates is a member and (ii) the Seller Prepared Tax Returns
shall not include any Tax Return of Buyer, of any Affiliate of Buyer (other
than the Company) or of any Affiliated Group of which Buyer or any Affiliate
of Buyer (other than the Company) is a member.

  

  

(d) The Parties shall provide one another with such assistance as may
reasonably be requested by the others in connection with the preparation and
filing of any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any taxing
authority, or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to Tax
Returns or Taxes. Such assistance shall include making employees available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation
of material provided hereunder and shall include providing copies of relevant
Tax Returns and supporting material. Upon reasonable request, the Parties will
provide one another with any records or information in their possession which
are not privileged and are relevant to such preparation, audit, examination,
proceeding or determination.

  

  

(e) The Parties agree to treat any indemnification payment made pursuant to
_Article 8_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state and
local income Tax purposes to the extent permitted by Law.

  

  

(f) With respect to Taxes of the Company for any Straddle Period, for purposes
of this Agreement, the portion of any Tax that is allocable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall: (i) in the case of real property Taxes, personal property
Taxes and other similar ad valorem Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such
Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of calendar days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes,
determined as though the taxable year of the Company terminated at the end of
the Closing Date.

  

  

(g) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer (i) a certificate,
duly executed and acknowledged and dated as of the Closing Date, reasonably
accepted to Buyer and in the form provided in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B) and (ii) a duly completed and executed IRS Form W-9.

  

  

 

-34-  

  

  

(h) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause any Tax sharing, Tax
indemnification, Tax allocation and other similar agreements between the
Company, on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Company), on the other hand, to be terminated with no further liability for
the Company thereunder.

  

  

(i) Without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned), Buyer shall not take (and
following the Closing Buyer shall prevent the Company from taking) the
following actions, if such action would reasonably be expected to give rise to
an indemnification claim against Seller under this Agreement or otherwise
affect the Taxes of Seller: (i) amend or cause the amendment of any Tax Return
of the Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) make any Tax
election regarding the Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii)
file any Tax Return of the Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period in
any jurisdiction if the Company did not file a comparable Tax Return involving
similar Tax items in such jurisdiction in the immediately preceding Tax
period, or (iv) initiate any discussion or enter into any voluntary disclosure
program (or similar program or agreement) with a Governmental Body regarding
any Tax (whether asserted or unasserted) or Tax Return with respect to the
Company relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; provided, however, that such
limitations set forth in clause (iii) above shall not apply to the extent that
a Tax Return is required to be filed as a result of a change in Law or a
change in the Company's business, in both cases after the end of the period
for which the "comparable" Tax Return would previously have been filed.

Employee Benefit Plans

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(a) Effective as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date, each Business Employee
shall cease all active participation in and further accrual of benefits under
the Plans that are not Company Plans (such Plans, the "Seller Plans"). Seller
shall retain sponsorship of, and shall retain and indemnify and hold harmless
Buyer and its Affiliates against, all liabilities under the Seller Plans,
whether arising before, on or after the Closing, and Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Company) shall not assume sponsorship of, contribute to or
maintain, or have any liability with respect to, the Seller Plans.

  

  

(b) The Seller shall update Schedules 2.15(c)(i) and 2.15(c)(ii) to the
Disclosure Memorandum from time to time following the date hereof, as
reasonably requested by Buyer and, shall, on the Closing Date, provide Buyer
with a list of all employees of Seller and its Affiliates who experienced an
"employment loss" (as defined in the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act) at each site of employment of the Company during the 90-day
period prior to the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing Date, for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting where length of
service is relevant under any employee benefit plan of the Company, Buyer or
any of its subsidiaries, as applicable, in which employees of the Company who
continue to be employed by the Company, Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, as
applicable, immediately following the Closing (the "Continuing Employees") are
eligible to participate, the Continuing Employees shall receive service credit
for service with the Company under such plans to the same extent such service
was credited under similar Plans of the Company prior to the Closing Date;
provided, however, that (i) such service shall not be credited to the extent
that it would result in a duplication of benefits and (ii) no such credit
shall be provided for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan or post-retirement welfare plan. Following the Closing Date, with
respect to welfare plans maintained by the Company, Buyer or its subsidiaries,
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such plans to (x)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect
to participation and coverage requirements otherwise applicable to such
Continuing Employees under such plan (including any actively at-work
requirements) to the same extent satisfied or waived under a comparable Plan
and (y) provide each such Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments,
deductibles, and similar payments paid during the relevant plan year and prior
to the Closing Date in satisfying any substantially analogous requirements
applicable under any such welfare plan. As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall,
or shall cause the Company to provide to the Continuing Employees base salary
or wage rate, cash bonus opportunity and benefit arrangements that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the base salary or wage rate,
cash bonus opportunity and benefit arrangements that are provided to similarly
situated employees of Buyer (taking into account, without limitation,
applicable position and location of employment), including participation in
Buyer's 401(k) plan.

  

  

 

-35-  

  

  

(c) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement (and without
limiting _Section 6.6(a)_ ), Seller shall retain responsibility for (i) all
employment and employee-benefit-related liabilities that relate to any
Business Employee that is not a Continuing Employee (or any dependent or
beneficiary of such Business Employee) that arise at any time, and (ii) all
employment and employee-benefit-related liabilities that relate to any
Continuing Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary of such Continuing
Employee) that arise as a result of an event or events that occurred prior to
11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date. Except as otherwise specifically provided in
this Agreement, effective as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date, Buyer shall
assume and be solely responsible for all employment and employee-benefits
related liabilities that relate to the Continuing Employees (or any dependent
or beneficiary of any Continuing Employee) that arise as a result of an event
or events that occurred on or after 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date. Except as
otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement (and without limiting
_Section 6.6(a)_ ), (A) Seller shall retain all liabilities for all workers'
compensation, short- and long-term disability, medical, prescription drug,
dental, vision, life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment and other
welfare benefit claims ("Welfare Claims") incurred by the Continuing Employees
and their eligible dependents prior to 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date that are
covered under the terms of the applicable Plans, and (B) Buyer shall be
responsible for all liabilities for Welfare Claims incurred on or after 11:59
p.m. on the Closing Date by the Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents. For these purposes, a Welfare Claim shall be deemed to be
incurred: (w) in the case of workers' compensation and short-term disability
benefits, at the time of the injury, sickness or other event giving rise to
the claim for such benefits; (x) in the case of medical, prescription, drug,
dental or vision benefits, at the time the professional services, equipment or
prescription drugs covered by the applicable plan are obtained; (y) in the
case of life insurance benefits, upon death; and (z) in the case of accidental
death and dismemberment benefits, at the time of the accident. In the case of
workers' compensation claims relating to an injury or condition that occurred
over a period both preceding and following 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date, the
claim shall be the joint responsibility of Seller and Buyer, and shall be
equitably apportioned between them based on the relative periods of time that
the condition or injury transpired preceding and following 11:59 p.m. on the
Closing Date.

  

  

 

-36-  

  

  

(d) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Continuing Employees shall cease to
participate in the Code Section 401(k) plan maintained by Seller ("Seller's
401(k) Plan"), and as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall provide or cause to be provided to the Continuing Employees
the right to participate in a Code Section 401(k) plan maintained by Buyer or
one of its Affiliates (the "Buyer's 401(k) Plan"). As soon as is reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall cause, upon participant
election, the direct rollover of eligible rollover distributions of Continuing
Employees from Seller's 401(k) Plan to Buyer's 401(k) Plan; _provided_ that,
in lieu of such distributions, Seller may, upon mutual agreement between the
Parties, cause the trustee of Seller's 401(k) Plan to transfer the account
balances of the Continuing Employees from Seller's 401(k) Plan to the Buyer's
401(k) Plan (the "Plan to Plan Transfer") in accordance with the requirements
of Code Sections 411(d)(6) and 414(l). If Parties agree to effect a Plan to
Plan Transfer, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to affect
such transfer of account balances in a timely manner. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, provided that the Parties agree to effect a Plan
to Plan Transfer, Seller shall promptly provide Buyer with such documents and
other information as Buyer shall reasonably request to assure itself that the
trust-to-trust transfer described herein may be accepted into Buyer's 401(k)
Plan in accordance with applicable Law. In addition, (i) if the Parties agree
to effect a Plan to Plan Transfer, Seller shall provide to each Continuing
Employee matching contributions under Seller's 401(k) Plan for the plan year
that includes the Closing Date based on the formulas set forth in such plan,
but calculated without regard to any service requirement imposed under such
plan (if any) and (ii) if the Parties do not agree to effect a Plan to Plan
Transfer, the Seller shall cooperate with Buyer and take all necessary or
appropriate action to prevent default on any Continuing Employee loans under
the Seller's 401(k) Plan.

  

  

(e) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days to which each
Continuing Employee shall be entitled during calendar year 2018, Buyer shall
assume and honor all vacation days accrued or earned during the period
beginning January 1, 2017 through the Closing Date but not yet taken by such
Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date (subject to any applicable maximum
under the applicable Plan), to the extent such vacation days are set forth on
Schedule 2.14(c)(i) (the "Assumed Vacation"). Except as set forth in this
_Section 6.6(e)_ , following the Closing, the Continuing Employees'
eligibility for vacation and other paid time off shall be determined under
Buyer's then-current vacation policy; provided, that the Assumed Vacation may
not be subject to forfeiture unless and until used by the applicable
Continuing Employee.

  

  

(f) As soon as administratively practicable following the Closing, Seller
shall distribute to each Continuing Employee the full amount of his or her
account balance under the Molina Healthcare, Inc. Amended and Restated
Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Molina DCP"), in each case, in accordance
with the terms of the Molina DCP and in compliance with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code and shall assure that no such distributions will
subject any Continuing Employee to any Section 409A Taxes.

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.6_ to the contrary, nothing
contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an
establishment, amendment or other modification of any Plan or any employee
benefit plan of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or shall limit the right of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any
Company Plan or other employee benefit plan following the Closing Date. Seller
and Buyer acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section
6.6_ are included for their sole benefit, and that nothing in this _Section
6.6_ , whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or
other rights: (i) in any other Person, including any Business Employee, any
participant in any Plan or employee benefit plan of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued
employment or engagement with Buyer or any of its Affiliates or to any
particular term or condition of employment or engagement.

Replacement of Guarantees

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to put
in place, effective as of the Closing, instruments equivalent to the
Guarantees in effect as of the date hereof (or as modified with Buyer's
consent pursuant to _Section 6.1_ ). Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, and Seller shall cooperate as reasonably requested by Buyer to, cause
Buyer to be substituted in all respects for Seller, effective as of the
Closing Date, in respect of all obligations of Seller under each of the
Guarantees (and Seller shall be released from any such obligations), so that
as a result of such substitution, Seller shall, from and after the Closing,
cease to have any obligation whatsoever arising from or in connection with the
Guarantees. If Buyer is not successful, for any reasons, in obtaining the
complete release of Seller from the Guarantees by the Closing Date, then (a)
Buyer shall continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
promptly the complete and unconditional release of Seller from each Guarantee
following the Closing and (b) Buyer shall indemnify Seller for any cost
related to or any demand or draw upon, or withdrawal from, any Guarantee.

  

  

    

6.8

Right to Seller Name and Seller Marks

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

Subject to this _Section 6.8_ , Buyer and its Affiliates (which, for the
purposes of this _Section_ 6.8 shall include the Company) shall make no use of
the Seller Name and Seller Marks in connection with the operation of the
Company after the Name Change Deadline. Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates,
acknowledges and agrees that neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall
have any rights in any of the Seller Name and Seller Marks and neither Buyer
nor any of its Affiliates shall contest the ownership or validity of any
rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates in or to any of the Seller Name and
Seller Marks. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that immediately following the
Closing, but no later than the Name Change Deadline, Buyer shall cause the
name of the Company to be changed in order to remove the Seller Name and
Seller Marks in the name the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller
acknowledges that the Seller Name and Seller Marks may have been utilized
prior to the Closing in connection with Contracts of the Company and any
invoices, letters or other documentation related thereto and those materials
shall not be deemed a breach of this _Section_ 6.8; provided, however, that
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify all counterparties
to such Contracts of the name change in the Ordinary Course of Business
following the Closing Date.

  

  

    

6.9

  |  

Restrictive Covenants

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the second
(2nd) anniversary thereof (the "Restricted Period"), Seller will not directly
or indirectly invest in, own, manage, operate, finance or control any Person
engaged in any business that competes with the Company (the "Restricted
Business") anywhere in any state within the United States or territory that is
part of the United States, in each case, in which the Company operates as of
the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) Seller may own,
directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, five percent (5%) or less of
the securities of any Person that is engaged in a Restricted Business; (ii)
Seller may, directly or indirectly, acquire any Person or business engaged in
the Restricted Business if in the immediately preceding twelve-month period
prior to execution of definitive documentation reflecting such acquisition,
the consolidated revenues of such Person or business from the Restricted
Business constituted less than twenty percent (20%) of the total revenues of
such Person or business during such period; and (iii) in the event that Seller
undergoes a merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of its
assets, sale of at least a majority of its outstanding shares, or other change
of control, merger of equals or similar transaction (a "Seller MandA
Transaction") with a third party (a "Seller Acquirer"), pursuant to which the
holders of Seller's capital stock immediately prior to such transaction own,
in the aggregate, less than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting
power of the capital stock of the parent, successor or surviving entity after
such transaction and a majority of the members of its Board of Directors
immediately prior to such transaction cease to be members of such parent,
successor or surviving entity's Board of Directors after such transaction,
none of the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ 6.9(a) shall apply with
respect to the Seller MandA Transaction, or the Seller Acquirer or any Affiliate
thereof (other than Seller and Seller's direct and indirect subsidiaries in
existence immediately prior to the Seller MandA Transaction).

  

  

 

-38-  

  

  

(b) During the Restricted Period, Seller shall not directly or indirectly
solicit or hire any employee of the Company as of the Closing or who is or
becomes employed by the Company during the Restricted Period with the title of
vice president or director (including any state director or clinical director)
or any employee that has a title or position that is senior to any of the
foregoing (the "Restricted Employee") as of the Closing, or induce any such
Restricted Employee to terminate such employment. The foregoing restrictions
shall not apply to (i) a general solicitation (including through the use of a
search firm) which is not directed specifically to any such Restricted
Employees or the hiring of any Restricted Employee that responds to such
general solicitation or (ii) the solicitation or hiring of any such Restricted
Employee who has been terminated by Buyer or the Company.

  

  

(c) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth
(5th) anniversary thereof, Seller shall (i) treat all information relating to
Buyer and the Company as confidential, preserve the confidentiality thereof,
and not use or disclose to any Person such information (except as expressly
permitted by this Agreement) and (ii) cause its directors, officers,
employees, representatives or other agents who have had access to such
information to keep it confidential and not to use or disclose to any Person
any such information (except as expressly permitted by this Agreement), unless
such information (A) is or becomes publicly available through no act or
omission in violation hereof of Seller or its Affiliates or any of its or
their directors, officers, employees, representatives or other agents, or (B)
is required by Law or the rules or regulations of any U.S. or foreign
securities exchange or similar organization. If the disclosure of such
information is required by Law or such rules and regulations, Seller shall
cooperate with and provide Buyer an opportunity to object to the disclosure
and shall give Buyer as much prior written notice as is possible under the
circumstances. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, at
Buyer's expense, to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will
be accorded to any such information required by Law or such rules and
regulations to be disclosed.

  

  

(d) The covenants and undertakings contained in this _Section_ ___6.9_ relate
to matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a
violation of any of the terms of this _Section_ 6.9 could cause irreparable
injury to Buyer and its Affiliates, the amount of which will be impossible to
estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. Accordingly,
the remedy at law for any breach of this _Section_ 6.9 will be inadequate.
Therefore, Buyer will be entitled to a temporary and permanent injunction,
restraining order or other equitable relief from any court of competent
jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this _Section_ 6.9 without the
necessity of proving actual damage or posting any bond whatsoever. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement (including in _Section 6.5(b)_ )
shall limit Buyer's ability to seek specific performance or to otherwise
recover Losses pursuant to _Article 8_ with respect to any breach of this
_Section_ 6.9.

  

  

 

-39-  

  

  

(e) The Parties agree that the restrictions contained in this _Section_ 6.9,
including the term of the Restricted Period and the scope of the restrictions,
are reasonable in light of the nature of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement and the need for Buyer to protect the goodwill associated with the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that if the
provisions of this _Section_ 6.9 are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be unenforceable in any respect, it is their intention that
the restrictions set forth herein be enforced to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, and that such court shall modify the restrictions to the extent
necessary to permit them to be enforced.

Affiliate Arrangements

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

Except for this Agreement and the other Operative Documents, Seller shall
cause (a) all Affiliate Arrangements to be terminated as of, and of no further
force and effect after, the Closing with no further liabilities on the part of
any party thereto and (b) all intercompany payable amounts and intercompany
receivable amounts, in each case between Seller Group (other than the
Company), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, to be netted
and settled in a manner that does not result in additional Tax Liabilities to
the Company such that, as of the Closing, neither the Company nor any member
of the Seller Group shall have any obligation in respect of any additional
balances (it being understood that such cancellation shall not in any way
affect the Operative Documents or any amounts which may be payable pursuant to
the Operative Documents). Furthermore, Seller shall cause each of the
restructuring steps set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto to have been completed at
least one (1) business day prior to the Closing Date.

Post-Closing Remittance of Certain Amounts

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(a) To the extent the Company receives any NJ Customer DDI Contract Receipts
following the Closing then:

  

  

(i) the NJ Customer DDI Contract Receipts shall be retained by Buyer and the
Company until the Company receives NJ Customer DDI Contract Receipts that are
equal to the amount set forth on Schedule 6.11(a) (the "NJ DDI Deductible");
and

  

  

 

-40-  

  

  

(ii) once the Company has received NJ Customer DDI Contract Receipts equal to
the NJ DDI Deductible, then the Company shall within thirty (30) days of
receipt pay to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Seller any additional NJ Customer DDI Contract Receipts
up to an aggregate amount equal to the Interim Period NJ DDI Deferred Contract
Costs. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Buyer nor the Company shall have
any obligation to pay to Seller any NJ Customer DDI Contract Receipts that are
in excess of the Interim Period NJ DDI Deferred Contract Costs.

  

  

(b) To the extent the Company receives payment for any Aged AR following the
Closing, then the Company shall within thirty (30) days of receipt pay to
Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Seller an amount equal to the Aged AR received by the Company;
provided, however, that Seller may, in its sole discretion, collect such Aged
AR as part of the services under the Transition Services Agreement to the
extent consistent with past practice.

  

  

(c) Within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter following
the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller reasonably detailed quarterly
statements of the amount of NJ Customer Contract Receipts and payments for any
Aged AR received during the prior quarter.

RandW Insurance Policy

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

Buyer has bound coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy and delivered a true
and correct copy of the RandW Insurance Policy to Seller. Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not amend, waive or otherwise modify the subrogation
provision under the RandW Insurance Policy in any manner that would allow the
insurer thereunder to subrogate or otherwise make or bring any Claim against
any Seller Indemnified Party except in the case of fraud. Seller shall be an
intended third party beneficiary of the subrogation provision applicable to
Seller Indemnified Parties. All premiums, underwriting fees and similar costs
associated with Buyer obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy shall be borne fifty
percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller (as a Company
Transaction Expense).

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parties;

  

  

(b) by either Party, if the Closing has not occurred by December 31, 2018 (the
"Drop Dead Date"); provided, however, that if all of the conditions to
Closing, other than the conditions set forth in _Section 4.6_ and _Section
5.7_ , shall have been satisfied or shall be capable of being satisfied at
such time, the Drop Dead Date shall automatically be extended to March 31,
2019; provided further that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section_ 7.1(b) shall not be available to a Party if such Party fails to

the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date;

  

  

 

-41-  

  

  

(c) by either Party, if there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the

transactions contemplated herein is entered and such judgment, injunction,
order or decree shall become final;

  

  

(d) by Seller, in the event of a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation
or warranty set forth in Article 3 or any failure to perform any covenant or
agreement to be complied with or performed by Buyer pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement if such breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform cannot be
cured or has not been cured within thirty (30) days following the receipt by
Buyer of written notice thereof from Seller and such breach, inaccuracy or
failure to perform has caused or would result in the failure of a condition
set forth in _Section_ 5.1 or _Section_ 5.2 to be satisfied (and such
condition is not waived in writing by Seller) on or prior to the Drop Dead
Date; provided, however, that Seller may not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section_ 7.1(d) if Seller is in material breach of this Agreement;

  

  

(e) by Buyer, in the event of a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation
or warranty set forth in Article 2 or Article 2A or any failure to perform any
covenant or agreement to be complied with or performed by Seller pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement if such breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform
cannot be cured or has not been cured within thirty (30) days following the
receipt by Seller of written notice thereof from Buyer and such breach,
inaccuracy or failure to perform has caused or would result in the failure of
a condition set forth in _Section_ 4.1 or _Section_ 4.2 to be satisfied (and
such condition is not waived in writing by Buyer) on or prior to the Drop Dead
Date; provided, however, that Buyer may not terminate this Agreement pursuant

through the failure of Seller to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement) and Seller has not waived such condition; or

  

  

(g) by Buyer, if satisfaction of any of the conditions in _Sections_ 4.4 and
4.6 on or prior to the Drop Dead Date is or becomes impossible (other than

willful breach hereof and except that the provisions of this _Section 7.2_
(Effect of Termination) and _Article 9_ (General), and obligations under the
Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

Survival

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

All (i) representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto (other than Fundamental Representations
which shall survive until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations) and (ii) covenants contained in this
Agreement requiring performance on or prior to the Closing Date shall, in each
case, survive the Closing for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date. Any covenants requiring performance, in whole or in part, after the
Closing shall survive the Closing until fully performed. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that the foregoing survival
periods are a contractual statute of limitations and any claim brought by any
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article 8_ must be brought or filed prior
to the expiration of the applicable survival period; provided, that any
indemnity claim made by a Party prior to the end of such survival period shall
survive until such claim is fully paid or finally and completely adjudicated
or settled in accordance with this Agreement.

Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article 8_, after the Closing,
Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer and its Affiliates, including the
Company after the Closing, and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents and Affiliates (each, a "Buyer Indemnified Party" and
together, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against, and
shall reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Parties for, any and all losses,
damages, debts, liabilities, obligations, judgments, orders, awards, writs,
injunctions, decrees, fines, penalties, Taxes, costs or expenses (including
any reasonable legal or accounting fees or expenses and the aggregate amount
of any gross-up payments paid by any Buyer Indemnified Party to make
Continuing Employees whole (on an after-Tax basis) for any Section 409A Taxes
or the Specified Tax Matter, but excluding any amount that was taken into
account in determining Net Working Capital of the Company pursuant to
_Section_ 1.3) ("Losses") arising out of:

  

  

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by or
on behalf of Seller in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto disregarding, in each case, any reference to "materiality", "Company
Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifications therein for purposes of
determining the existence of any such inaccuracy or breach and the amount of
Losses resulting therefrom;

  

  

(b) any breach by Seller of any covenant or obligation in this Agreement or in
any certificate delivered pursuant hereto;

  

  

(c) any and all Pre-Closing Taxes; or

Indemnification by Buyer

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article 8_, after the Closing,
Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller and its agents and Affiliates (the
"Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against, and shall reimburse
the Seller Indemnified Parties for, any and all Losses arising out of:

  

  

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by or
on behalf of Buyer in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto disregarding, in each case, any reference to "materiality", "material
adverse effect" or similar qualifications therein for purposes of determining
the existence of any such inaccuracy or breach and the amount of Losses
resulting therefrom; or

  

  

(b) any breach by Buyer of any covenant or obligation in this Agreement or in
any certificate delivered pursuant hereto.

  

  

    

8.4

  |  

Limitations

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(a) Any Person against whom an Indemnification Claim is being asserted (an
"Indemnifying Party") shall not be obligated to defend and hold harmless any
Person claiming indemnification under this _Article 8_ (an "Indemnified
Party"), or otherwise be liable to such Indemnified Party, with respect to any
Indemnification Claim made by the Indemnified Party after the expiration of
the applicable survival period as set forth in _Section_ 8.1, except that
indemnity may be sought after the expiration of the survival period if a Claim
Notice with respect to such Indemnification Claim shall have been delivered to
the Indemnified Party prior to the expiration of the survival period. For the
avoidance of doubt and subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article
8_ , the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be permitted to submit a claim notice
to Seller, solely for purposes of tolling any survival period relating thereto
prior to submitting any such claim under the RandW Insurance Policy.

  

  

(b) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to receive any indemnification
payment with respect to Indemnification Claims made pursuant to (i) _Section
8.2(a)_ with respect to any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty in _Section 2.9_ or (ii) _Section_ 8.2(c) (collectively, "Tax
Claims"), in either case, with respect to any Loss or a series of related
Losses that can be recovered from the RandW Insurance Policy of less than
$25,000 (a "De Minimis Loss"). In addition, no Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to receive any indemnification payment with respect to (i)
Indemnification Claims made pursuant to _Section_ 8.2(a) or _Section_ 8.3(a)
(including Tax Claims but excluding claims regarding breaches of or
inaccuracies in any other Fundamental Representation) or (ii) Tax Claims with
respect to, for purposes of this clause (ii), Losses that can be recovered
from the RandW Insurance Policy ((i) and (ii) collectively, "General Claims"),
as the case may be, until all Losses (including any De Minimis Loss with
respect to Tax Claims) exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to $1,330,000
(the "Deductible", provided that the Deductible shall be reduced by the amount
of any Losses incurred by Buyer that are related to the Specified Litigation
Matter), in which such case, subject to the additional limitations of this
_Article 8_ , such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover all Losses
so incurred in excess of the Deductible.

  

  

(c) The aggregate liability of any Indemnifying Party under this _Article 8_
for any and all Indemnification Claims shall be limited to (i) $1,330,000 with
respect to General Claims and (ii) an amount equal to the Purchase Price
actually received by Seller with respect to all other Indemnification Claims
(including claims regarding breaches of or inaccuracies in Fundamental
Representations (other than the representations or warranties in _Section 2.9_
) and claims regarding the matters set forth in _Section 8.2(b)_ , _Section
8.2(d)_ and _Section 8.3(b)_ ).

  

  

 

-44-  

  

  

(d) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article 8_ , consideration
must be given to the amount that any party recovers as proceeds of insurance
(including the RandW Insurance Policy) or from third parties in respect of such
Losses ("Third Party Recoveries"), net of any costs of collection, deductible,
retroactive premium adjustment, reimbursement obligation or other cost
directly related to such Third Party Recovery. Each person seeking
indemnification hereunder agrees that it will use commercially reasonable
efforts to prosecute all claims against its insurers (including the RandW
Insurance Policy) and other persons with respect to Third Party Recoveries
diligently and in good faith with regard to matters for which Losses are
claimed under this _Article 8_. Should an Indemnified Party recover Losses
from the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article 8_ , and subsequently
recover any Third Party Recovery with respect to the matter for which such
Losses were paid, such Indemnified Party shall refund the lesser of (i) the
Losses paid by the Indemnifying Party and (ii) the amount of such Third Party
Recovery. In addition to the foregoing limitations in this _Section 8.4(d)_ ,
with respect to any Loss subject to indemnification under _Section 8.2_ ,
Buyer shall first submit such Loss for coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recover for such Loss under
the RandW Insurance Policy (including by contesting any improper denial of
coverage) prior to pursuing any recovery against Seller under this _Article 8_
; provided, that this sentence shall not apply to an Indemnification Claim
that is not a General Claim.

  

  

(e) The Parties' sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims
or causes of action (whether based in contract, tort (including negligence),
strict liability, law or equity, or any other cause of action) (other than
injunctions or other equitable remedies pursuant to _Section_ 9.13, or claims
of, or causes of action arising from fraud or intentional misrepresentation
(but excluding negligent misrepresentation)) relating to the Agreement, and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article 8_ (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
none of the limitations on indemnification set forth in this _Article 8_ shall
apply in the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation (but excluding
negligent misrepresentation)). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
_Article 8_ shall limit the rights or remedies of, or constitute a waiver of
any rights or remedies by, any Person pursuant to (or shall otherwise operate
to interfere with the operation of) the applicable provisions of any Operative
Document or Buyer's ability to seek recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy.

  

  

(f) Each Person seeking indemnification hereunder shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate Losses (including using commercially reasonable
efforts to exercise cure rights under contracts) for which it seeks
indemnification hereunder; provided, however, that any reasonable costs
incurred by such Person in connection with such mitigation shall constitute
Losses hereunder.

  

  

(g) None of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from the
Indemnifying Parties for any Losses arising under the Operative Documents or
in connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated thereby
any incidental, indirect, special, consequential (including lost revenues or
lost profits), exemplary or punitive damages, unless such damages are
reasonably foreseeable or are awarded to a third party by a court or tribunal.

Procedure for Indemnification

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give written notice (the "Claim Notice") of any
matter which an Indemnified Party has determined has given rise or could give
rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement (other than a Third
Party Claim) of any Indemnification Claim prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period as set forth in _Section_ 8.1 and (A) within twenty
(20) business days of such determination by Buyer and (B) if such
Indemnification Claim relates to the assertion against an Indemnified Party of
any Claim by a third party (a "Third Party Claim"), within twenty (20)
business days after receipt by the Indemnified Party of written notice of a
legal process relating to such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the
failure or delay to so notify the Indemnifying Party, in accordance with
clause (A) or (B) above shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
obligation or liability that the Indemnifying Party may have to the
Indemnified Party, unless, and then only to the extent that, the Indemnifying
Party demonstrates that the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend or resolve
such Indemnification Claim is materially adversely affected thereby. Any such
Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
on which the asserted Indemnification Claim is based and specify the amount of
such Indemnification Claim if then ascertainable.

  

  

(b) If the Indemnifying Party admits in writing given to the Indemnified Party
after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a Claim Notice that Losses
identified in such Claim Notice constitute indemnifiable claims, the
Indemnified Party shall, subject to the other terms of this _Article 8_ , be
paid the amount of the Losses related to such Indemnification Claim or the
uncontested portion thereof. All other Indemnification Claims shall be
resolved by the Parties in accordance with either (A) a mutual agreement among
the Parties, which shall be memorialized in writing, or (B) the final decision
of a court of competent jurisdiction that is not subject to further appeal.

  

  

(c) (i) Subject to _Sections 8.5_ (d) and _(e)_ , the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right, upon written notice given to the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) days after receipt of a Claim Notice relating to a Third Party
Claim, to assume the defense or handling of such Third Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Party's sole expense, in which case the provisions of _Section
8.5(c)(ii)_ shall govern.

  

  

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall select counsel to conduct the defense or
handling of such Third Party Claim reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall defend or handle such Third Party Claim in
consultation with the Indemnified Party and in such manner as is reasonable
under the circumstances and shall keep the Indemnified Party timely apprised
of the status of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, agree to a
settlement of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any
Third Party Claim, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
unless such settlement of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect to such Third Party claim: (i) by its terms unconditionally releases
the Indemnified Party from all liability in connection with such Third Party
Claim, (ii) does not include an admission of wrongdoing or misconduct by the
Indemnified Party, and (iii) does not impose any injunctive or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party and shall be entitled to participate in but not
control the defense or handling of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel
and at its own expense. The Indemnified Party shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), agree to a settlement of any Third Party
Claim that is being defended and handled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this _Section 8.5(c)(ii)_.

  

  

 

-46-  

  

  

(d) (i) If (A) the Indemnifying Party does not give written notice to the
Indemnified Party within ten (10) business days after receipt of the Claim
Notice from the Indemnified Party of a Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying
Party has elected to assume the defense or handling of such Third Party Claim,
(B) at any time the Indemnifying Party shall fail to carry out such defense or
handling diligently and in such manner as is reasonable under the
circumstances after written notice to such effect that is not cured as soon as
practicable thereafter, (C) the Indemnified Party has reasonably determined,
upon advice of counsel, that having common counsel with the Indemnifying Party
would present such counsel with a conflict of interest or (D) the Third-Party
Claim (i) seeks any injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party or arises in connection with a criminal proceeding or (ii)
seeks monetary damages in such an amount that, given the limitations on the
amount of Losses for which the Indemnifying Party is responsible hereunder,
the Indemnified Party would reasonably be expected to be responsible for more
than fifty percent (50%) of such Losses, then the Indemnifying Party shall not
have a right to assume the defense or handling of such Third Party Claim and
the provisions of _Section 8.5(d)(ii)_ shall govern.

  

  

(ii) The Indemnified Party may, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, select
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party to defend or handle
such Third Party Claim in consultation with the Indemnifying Party and in a
manner that is reasonable under the circumstances; provided, however, that the
Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party timely apprised of the
status of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to a
settlement of, or consent to the entry of any judgment to, such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Indemnified Party
defends or handles such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnified Party and shall be entitled to participate in
but not control the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and
at its own expense.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Sections 8.5_ (c) and (d), Seller shall
have the right, at its expense, to pursue, contest and appeal, in a forum and
with counsel, any Claims or assessments made against the Company that are with
respect to any Taxes or Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period if (i)
Seller would be required to indemnify Buyer pursuant to this _Article 8_ for
at least half of the Taxes that would reasonably be expected to result
therefrom and (ii) such Claim or assessment is not against an Affiliated Group
of which Buyer (or any of Buyer's Affiliates, other than the Company) is a
member; provided that Seller shall keep Buyer fully informed regarding the
status of, and, with respect to Taxes (other than income taxes for which the
Company and Buyer would not be liable and that would not be binding on or
adversely affect Buyer and its Affiliates), shall (x) allow Buyer and Buyer's
advisors to participate in any such proceeding, at Buyer's expense, and (y)
not enter into any settlement of any such Claims or assessments (or portions
thereof) or otherwise compromise any issue that reasonably could affect any
Tax liability of the Company or Buyer (or Buyer's Affiliates) for any period
after the Closing Date without Buyer's consent, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Subject to the preceding sentence, Buyer
shall have the right to pursue, contest, appeal and otherwise control all
other Claims or assessments relating to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company,
Buyer or any of Buyer's Affiliates; provided that, if and to the extent Seller
would be reasonably expected to have liability with respect to such Taxes
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the claim could otherwise
reasonably be expected to affect the Taxes of Seller (or Seller's Affiliates),
Buyer shall permit Seller to participate in, but not control, any such
proceeding at Seller's own expense and Buyer shall not enter into any
settlement of that portion of any such Claims or assessments (or portions
thereof) without Seller's consent, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

Non-Recourse

Except as expressly set forth in this _Article 8_ , no Party shall have
recourse whatsoever under this Agreement or any other Operative Document
against any officers, directors or agents of the other Party (including for
such purposes, the officers, directors or agents of any Affiliate of a Party).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as expressly set
forth in this _Article 8_ , Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, and
Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, each hereby fully and
irrevocably waives any right, claim or entitlement whatsoever against such
officers, directors or agents relating to any and all Losses suffered or
incurred by any of them arising from, based upon, related to, or associated
with this Agreement, any other Operative Document and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (including any breach, termination or failure
to consummate such transactions) in each case whether based on contract, tort,
strict liability other laws or otherwise and whether by piercing of the
corporate veil, by claim on behalf of or by a Party or other Person or
otherwise.

Disclaimer of Projections

such projection or forecast delivered or made available by or on behalf of
Seller to Buyer, Buyer acknowledges that (a) there are uncertainties inherent
in attempting to make such projections and forecasts, (b) it is familiar with
such uncertainties, (c) it is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all such projections and forecasts
so furnished to it and (d) it shall have no claim against Seller.

shall be entitled to assign all or any part of this Agreement to any one or

Seller's consent (except that Buyer nonetheless shall remain responsible for
the performance of all of its obligations hereunder and liable for all of its
obligations hereunder). No failure on the part of any Party to exercise and no
delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right,
remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of
such right, remedy, power or privilege, nor shall any single or partial

negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation

 _Exhibit A_

  

  

Transition Services Agreement

  

  

This Transition Services Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of [●], 2018 by and among Molina Healthcare, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Seller_ "), Molina Information Systems, LLC, a California
limited liability company doing business as Molina Medicaid Solutions (the "
_Company_ "), and DXC Technology Company, a Nevada corporation (" _Buyer_ ").
Seller, the Company and Buyer are referred to herein individually as a "
_Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_ ". Capitalized terms used herein
but not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth
in the Purchase Agreement (as defined below).

  

  

RECITALS

  

  

A. Prior to the date hereof, Seller owned one hundred percent (100%) of the
outstanding equity interests of the Company (the " _Equity Interests_ ").

  

  

B. Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of June 26, 2018 (the
" _Purchase Agreement_ "), Seller is selling the Equity Interests to Buyer and
Buyer is purchasing the Equity Interest from Seller, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement effective as of the
Closing.

  

  

C. In connection with and as a condition to the consummation of such
transaction, the Parties are entering into this Agreement as Buyer desires
that Seller provide certain services to the Company and Seller desires to
provide to the Company such certain services on a transitional basis and on
the other terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

AGREEMENT

  

  

In consideration of the benefits to be derived from this Agreement and the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions contained
herein, the Parties agree as follows:

  

  

    

1.

  |  

Services

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

1.1 Provision of Services; Purpose.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, during the Service Term (as
defined below), Seller will provide or cause to be provided the services,
functions and tasks set forth on _Exhibit A_ , any Additional Services set
forth in any Statement of Work issued in accordance with _Section 1.3(a)_ and
any Omitted Services (as defined in _Section 1.3(c)_ ) (collectively, the "
_Services_ "). Seller will provide the Services to the Company with
substantially the same level of skill, quality, priority, timeliness, and care
as such services, functions and tasks were performed by Seller or its
Affiliate during the 12-month period prior to the Closing of the transactions
contemplated under the Purchase Agreement (" _Reference Period_ ") and in any
event in a manner that satisfies any service level commitments to the
Company's customers that were in effect as of Closing (" _Standard of Service_
").

  

  

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the sole purpose of the Services is
to support the ongoing operations of the Business (which includes providing
outsourced services to the Company's customers) while the Buyer transitions
the Business from Seller following the Closing, as promptly as possible,
during the Service Term.

  

  

  

[Exhibit A to the Purchase and Sale Agreement]

  

   

   

  

1.2 Persons Performing Services.

  

  

(a) The Parties contemplate that Seller will perform the Services using the
personnel of Seller or Seller's Affiliates, and that Seller will have no
obligation to engage any third party or hire any Person in order to provide
the Services. For all Seller or Seller Affiliates' employees and consultants
engaged in providing Services, if Seller determines that any such employee or
consultant is not needed to support Seller's retained business or is no longer
needed for any other reason or for no reason, then Seller may, in its sole
discretion, elect to terminate the employment or consulting relationship of
such individual, as applicable, provided, however, that any such termination
shall not relieve Seller of its obligation to satisfy the Standard of Service.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the provision of _Section 1.2(a)_ , Seller may in its sole
discretion and at its election arrange for third parties to provide or cause
to be provided to and through Seller for the benefit of the Company, any of
the Services. Seller will assure that third parties provide the Services in a
manner that satisfies the Standard of Service without disruption to the
Business and will be responsible for their acts and omissions as if they were
Seller's own.

  

  

1.3 Additional Services; Omitted Services.

  

  

(a) The Parties may agree to have Seller provide to the Company any additional
services not listed on _Exhibit A_ for purposes of fulfilling the purpose set
forth in _Section 1.1(b)_ (" _Additional Services_ ") by entering into a
statement of work in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Statement
of Work_ ") from time to time during the Service Term, each of which will, at
a minimum, include (i) a reference to this Agreement, which reference will be
deemed to incorporate all applicable provisions of this Agreement; (ii) a
description of the Additional Services to be provided to the Company pursuant
to such Statement of Work, including the location at which the Additional
Services are to be provided, and all deliverables to be provided as part of
the Additional Services pursuant to that Statement of Work; and (iii) any
additional provisions applicable to the Services provided under such Statement
of Work that are not otherwise set forth in this Agreement or that are
exceptions to the provisions set forth in this Agreement. No Statement of Work
for Additional Services will become effective until it has been executed and
delivered by each Party.

  

  

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
Seller shall have no obligation to provide or arrange for, or agree to provide
or arrange for, any Additional Services; provided, however, Seller agrees to
review all requests for Additional Services from Buyer or the Company in good
faith and, assuming the Parties can mutually agree on the terms of any such
Additional Services including compensation terms, will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer with respect to any such request
for Additional Services.

  

  

(c) To the extent that the Services described in _Exhibit A_ do not include
services, functions, or tasks that Seller or its Affiliates (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries) provided or caused to be provided to the Company
or the Business during the Reference Period and such omitted services,
functions, and tasks are reasonably necessary for the purpose set forth in
_Section 1.1(b)_ , Buyer shall have the right upon written notice to require
Seller to provide or cause to be provided such omitted services, functions,
and tasks (as requested, collectively, " _Omitted Services_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Omitted Services shall not include any services
specified in _Exhibit C_ and the term of any such Omitted Service shall not
exceed [one (1) year] from the Closing Date.1 Seller shall work in good faith
with Buyer and the Company to document in a Statement of Work the scope of
such Omitted Services and any Standards of Service and/or compensation
specific to such Omitted Services, however, to avoid disruption to the
Business, Seller will provide such Omitted Services substantially in the
manner and scope as they were provided during the Reference Period pending
agreement on such documentation. Compensation to Seller for an Omitted Service
will be consistent with the methodologies set forth in Schedule 6.3(a)(ii)(x)
to the Purchase Agreement.

  

   1 _Note to Draft_ : This will include, for example, legal oversight, buying
laptops and other services Seller has historically provided but will not
provide to Buyer.

 

  

  

[Exhibit A to the Purchase and Sale Agreement]

  

 

-2-  

  

  

1.4 Good Faith Cooperation. The Parties will use good faith efforts to
cooperate with each other in all matters relating to the provision and receipt
of Services. Such cooperation will include, at Buyer's request, providing
reasonable assistance and information to Buyer in connection with Buyer's
drafting of a plan to migrate responsibility for performance of the Services
from Seller and/or its agents to itself or Buyer's or the Company's own agents
and carrying out Seller's responsibilities under such plan (which may involve,
among other things, assisting with the transfer and conversion of data). Such
cooperation will also include providing Buyer and its agents (subject to
confidentiality provisions substantially similar to those set forth herein)
with copies of the data from such Seller information systems pertaining to the
Company or the Business in a commercially reasonable and mutually agreed
format, in order to effectuate such migration. The Parties will cooperate with
each other in making information available as needed in the event of a Tax
audit related to the Services, whether in the United States or any other
country.

  

  

1.5 Certain Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the
following limitations shall apply with respect to the Services rendered
hereunder:

  

  

(a) Impracticability. If Seller believes it is unable to perform any Services
due to any act or omission of Buyer or the Company in violation of this
Agreement or the Purchase Agreement, Seller shall promptly inform Buyer or the
Company of the issue and if Buyer or the Company does not correct the act or
omission within a reasonable time period (and it is in violation of this
Agreement or the Purchase Agreement) Seller shall be relieved of its
obligation to the extent impeded by such act or omission on the part of Seller
or the Company. The obligations of Seller to provide Services hereunder shall
be suspended during the period and to the extent that Seller is prevented from
complying therewith by any Law or by any cause beyond the reasonable control
of Seller, including acts of God, strikes, lock outs and other labor disputes
and disturbances, civil disturbances, accidents, terrorism, acts of war or
conditions arising out of or attributable to war (whether declared or
undeclared). In the event of any such condition of prevention contemplated by
this _Section_ 1.5(a), Seller shall promptly provide written notice to Buyer
of the same and use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or remove the
cause of such impossibility or impracticability as soon as reasonably
practicable. Seller shall resume the performance of such obligations as soon
as reasonably practicable after the removal of the cause and Seller shall so
notify Buyer.

  

  

  

[Exhibit A to the Purchase and Sale Agreement]

  

 

-3-  

  

  

(b) Maintenance. Seller shall have the right to shut down temporarily for
maintenance purposes the operation of the facilities providing any Services
whenever, in Seller's discretion, such action is reasonably necessary;
provided, that Seller shall only be permitted to shut down such facilities to
the extent consistent with the Company's service level commitments and other
commitments to its clients and Seller shall provide written notice of any such
shutdown to Buyer as reasonably in advance of such shutdown as practicable and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule such maintenance in
consultation with Buyer. Seller shall be relieved of its obligations to
provide the Services that are affected by such shutdown during the period that
its facilities are so shut down, but shall use reasonable efforts to minimize
each period of shutdown and, if consistent with the past practice of Seller or
Seller's Affiliate, shall provide such Services from alternate facilities. If
the shut-down lasts more than twenty-four (24) hours Buyer will be entitled to
a pro rata reduction in Service Fees for any affected Services. Seller shall
provide regular updates to Buyer as to when performance of affected Services
will be resumed.

  

  

(c) Reliance. In connection with providing the Services, Seller shall be
entitled to rely upon the genuineness, validity or truthfulness of any
document, instrument or other writing presented by Buyer, the Company or their
Affiliates or representatives. Seller shall not be liable for any impairment
of the Services it is providing hereunder caused by it not receiving
information, either timely or at all, or by its receiving inaccurate or
incomplete information from Buyer, the Company or their Affiliates or
representatives that is required or reasonably requested regarding or related
to such Services.

  

  

(d) Relationship of the Parties. Seller will not be deemed to be an
independent contractor and not an agent, joint venturer, or representative of
Buyer or the Company. No Party may create any obligations or responsibilities
on behalf of or in the name of another Party. Neither Seller on the one hand
and Buyer and the Company on the other hand will hold itself out to be a
partner, employee, franchisee, representative, servant, or agent of the other
Party.

  

  

(e) Change in the Business. The Parties (i) acknowledge that the scope,
duration, and pricing of the Services set forth in _Exhibit A_ are based on
the scope and size of the Business as of the date of hereof, and that, except
as otherwise set forth on _Exhibit A_ or a Statement of Work, such pricing
reflects a margin attributable to the costs associated with the administrative
burden and investment by Seller incurred in the provision of the Services; and
(ii) in the event the scope or size of the Business materially changes after
the date hereof, agree to use good faith efforts to revise such scope,
duration, and pricing (and associated margin) of the Services in _Exhibit A_
appropriately.

  

  

1.6 Points of Contact. Each Party agrees to designate a primary single point
of contact and as appropriate additional points of contact for the other Party
for the Services provided hereunder during the Service Term of this Agreement.

  

  

1.7 Title to Firmware or Software. Buyer acknowledges that neither it nor any
of its Affiliates or representatives will acquire any right, title or interest
(including any license rights or rights of use) in any firmware or software,
and the licenses therefor that are owned by Seller or any of its Affiliates,
by reason of the provision of the services provided by Seller hereunder.

  

  

  

[Exhibit A to the Purchase and Sale Agreement]

  

 

-4-  

  

  

1.8 Service Level Credits; Flow-Downs. Seller acknowledges that the Company's
ability to provide outsourced services to its customers during the Service
Term is dependent upon Seller's performance of the Services in accordance with
the Standard of Service and that, without limiting other damages for which the
Company may be liable to its customers, the Company may be responsible to pay
service level credits to its customers should Seller fail to perform in
accordance with such standard. Accordingly, in the event that the Company is
required to pay its customers service level credits due to Seller's failure to
perform Services in accordance with the Standard of Service, the Company will
be entitled to be reimbursed by Seller for such service level credits.
Moreover, Seller acknowledges that solely to the extent that Seller's
performance of certain Services has a direct impact on the Company's
performance of outsourced services (e.g., data center, network) to certain
customers, the Company requires that Seller comply with, and Seller agrees
that it will comply with, the terms and conditions of the applicable customer
agreements. Such terms and conditions include the terms and conditions set
forth in such agreements regarding data privacy and data protection,
confidentiality, intellectual property, and compliance with laws.

Compensation

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

2.1 Service Fees. Buyer shall pay Seller the applicable fee for each Service
set forth on _Exhibit A_ and, with respect to any Additional Services, the
fees set forth on each Statement of Work (collectively, " _Service Fees_ ").

  

  

2.2 Invoicing and Payment. Except as expressly set forth on _Exhibit A_ or a
Statement of Work, Seller will invoice Buyer monthly at the end of each month
for the amount of all Service Fees for that month. Amounts payable under each
invoice will be due within forty-five (45) days after Seller's delivery of the
invoice. Late payments will be subject to accrual of interest at ten percent
(10%), calculated on a monthly basis (the " _Interest Rate_ "). If _Exhibit A_
or a Statement of Work requires any prepayment by Buyer or the Company, Seller
shall not be obligated to provide the related Service until Buyer has made
such prepayment. Failure to timely pay an undisputed invoice shall constitute
a material breach of this Agreement and upon written notice and a cure period
of forty-five (45) following Seller's delivery of such notice, Seller may at
its option terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 5.3_. Buyer or
the Company will provide Seller notice of any good faith dispute regarding
Service Fees, which shall include the disputed amount (the " _Disputed Amount_
"), and work in good faith to resolve any such disputes in an expeditious
manner; in the meantime, Buyer will pay the undisputed portion of any invoice
hereunder and Seller will continue performance of the Services. If all or any
portion of the Disputed Amount is determined to have been due to Seller, then
Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount so due together with interest thereon at
the Interest Rate. For purposes of clarity, interest determined to have been
due to Seller shall accrue from the date of the underlying invoice.

  

  

2.3 Taxes. Except as expressly set forth in _Exhibit A_ or a Statement of
Work, the Service Fees do not include any sales tax, value added tax, goods
and services tax, transfer tax or similar tax (but excluding income tax)
(collectively, " _Taxes_ "). Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for any
such Taxes required to be paid, collected or withheld by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including any such Taxes included in amounts paid by Seller or any
of its Affiliates to any third party in connection with the provision of such
Services and Additional Services) in connection with this Agreement or the
provision of any Services or Additional Services contemplated hereby, which
reimbursement shall be in addition to the amounts required to be paid as set
forth in _Exhibit A_ or a Statement of Work.

  

  

  

[Exhibit A to the Purchase and Sale Agreement]

  

 

-5-  

  

  

3. Confidentiality. The Parties agree that certain non-public information supplied by each to the other during the provision of Services under this Agreement may be proprietary or confidential. Any such information shall be held in confidence by the receiving Party, using the same degree of care to preserve the confidentiality of such information that the Party to whom such confidential information is disclosed would use to preserve the confidentiality of its own information of a similar nature, but not less than reasonable care, and shall be used only for the purposes indicated in _Section 1.1(b)_ and performing the Services and receiving the benefit of the Services. The restrictions of this _Section 3_ shall not apply to information that: (a) the receiving Party can demonstrate was obtained by the receiving Party, without restrictions on use or disclosure, from a third party free to the knowledge of the receiving Party to disclose it without obligation to the disclosing Party; (b) is or becomes publicly known, through no wrongful act of the receiving Party; (c) the receiving Party can demonstrate was developed independently by such Party without any of the information received hereunder and by personnel not providing Services hereunder; or (d) is required to be disclosed to any government agency or is otherwise required to be disclosed by Law; provided that, in the case of (a), (b) or (c) hereof, before making such disclosure, to the extent practicable without prejudicing the rights, privileges or obligations of the receiving Party and to the extent permitted by Law, the receiving Party shall give the disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity, at the sole cost of the disclosing Party, to interpose an objection and/or take action to ensure confidential handling of such information. The obligations of this _Section 3_ shall survive for a period of five (5) years from the date hereof, notwithstanding the earlier termination of this Agreement.

  

  

    

4.

Indemnification; Limitations

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

4.1 Indemnification by Buyer. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each of Seller and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
contractors, representatives and agents (each, a " _Seller Indemnitee_ ") from
and against any and all Losses incurred by such Seller Indemnitee relating to
or in connection with the negligence under or breach of this Agreement by
Buyer, except to the extent such Losses arises out of or results from the
gross negligence or breach of this Agreement by Seller.

  

  

4.2 Indemnification by Seller. Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each of Buyer and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,

of or resulting from the negligence under or breach of this Agreement by
Seller except to the extent such Losses arise out of or result from the gross
negligence under or breach of this Agreement by Buyer.

  

  

4.3 Disclaimer of Warranties. Seller represents and warrants that it will
perform the Services in accordance with this Agreement and applicable Laws;
that it has the right to provide the Services (and to permit the Company to
receive them) in accordance with this Agreement without violation or breach of
any contractual obligations or applicable Laws and without any consents,
permissions or approval of any third parties that it has not obtained; and
that it can provide the Services in accordance with this Agreement without any
Additional Resources. SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING, THE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED

NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES
ARISING FROM COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.
SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE QUALITY, SUITABILITY
OR ADEQUACY OF THE SERVICES FOR ANY PURPOSE OR USE.

5.1 Term. Except as otherwise set forth on _Exhibit A_ or a Statement of Work,
this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and terminate on the earlier
of (a) the performance in full of the Services and (b) the date on which all
Services are terminated in accordance with this _Section 5_ or _Exhibit A_ ;
provided, however this Agreement may be terminated earlier in accordance with
_Sections 5.2-5.4_ below (the " _Services Term_ "); provided further, that
during the Services Term, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
establish its own internal capabilities for each of the Services or obtain
directly substitute services for each of the Services. If Buyer is not able to
transition any particular Service at the end of a particular Services Term,
Buyer shall have the right to extend the Services Term for an additional
period of [thirty] [(30)]3 days; provided, however, that such extension shall
only apply to the Services for which the Agreement is extended.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any Statement of Work
entered into during the Services Term (including any extension thereof)
provides for a performance period that extends beyond the Services Term, then
the Services Term shall be automatically extended, and this Agreement shall
remain effective, for the duration of the performance period under such
Statement of Work, provided, however, that such extension shall only apply to
the Services being performed under such Statement of Work.

payable for the first twelve (12) months of the Services Term (excluding any
Service Term extensions pursuant to Section 5.1).

  

3 _Note to Draft_ : Subject to further review and discussion.
