Section 1.6 Closing Date. The closing of the Purchase and Sale of the Assets

offices of Squire, Sanders and Dempsey L.L.P., 4900 Key Tower, 127 Public
Square, Cleveland, Ohio 44114 or at such other place or on such other date as
is mutually agreeable to the parties; provided, however, that if any of the
conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.1 of this Agreement have not been
satisfied or waived by both parties hereto on or before such date and time,
then the Closing will occur at the foregoing place and time on the third
business day after such condition has been satisfied or waived, but in no
event shall the Closing occur after May 14, 2004. The date of the Closing is
herein referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

 

 

Section 1.7 Post-Closing Adjustment

 

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer a
statement setting forth Sellers\' estimate of the aggregate value of the
Scheduled Liabilities (the " _Estimated Scheduled Liabilities Valuation_ "),
including an itemized list showing Sellers\' estimate of each of the Scheduled
Liabilities. The Estimated Scheduled Liabilities Valuation shall be prepared
(i) in accordance with GAAP, and (ii) on a basis consistent with the
preparation of the Financial Statements of the Business. The Estimated
Scheduled Liabilities Valuation shall be used to calculate the Closing Payment
absent manifest error.

 

 

(b) No later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to Sellers a statement setting forth the aggregate value of the
Scheduled Liabilities as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Liabilities
Valuation_ "), including an itemized list showing Buyer\'s determination of
the value of each of the Scheduled Liabilities. The Closing Date Liabilities
Valuation shall be prepared (i) in accordance with GAAP, and (ii) on a basis
consistent with the preparation of the Financial Statements of the Business.

 

 

(c) After receipt of the Closing Date Liabilities Valuation, Sellers shall
have thirty (30) days (the " _Sellers\' Review Period_ ") to review it. If,
within Sellers\' Review Period, Sellers notify Buyer in writing that they
object to any item(s) on the Closing Date Liabilities Valuation and specify
the item(s) and amount(s) in dispute and the basis for such dispute (the "
_Sellers\' Amendment Notice_ "), the parties shall use their best efforts to
reach agreement in respect of the disputed items within the fifteen (15) day-
period (the " _Resolution Period_ ") following the delivery of Sellers\'
Amendment Notice. Any item(s) on the Closing Date Liabilities Valuation not
identified in writing as a disputed item within Sellers\' Review Period shall
be deemed to have been accepted by Sellers and not subject to any further
review or change. If no Sellers\' Amendment Notice is received by Buyer during
Sellers\' Review Period, the Closing Date Liabilities Valuation shall be
deemed accepted by Sellers.

 

 

(d) If at the conclusion of the Resolution Period the parties have not reached
an agreement on Sellers\' objections, then all amounts and issues remaining in
dispute shall be submitted by Sellers and Buyer to a Neutral Accountant. The
fees, costs and expenses of the Neutral Accountant shall be borne
proportionately by Buyer and Sellers to the extent that each party\'s
calculation of the aggregate value of the Scheduled Liabilities differs from
the final Scheduled Liabilities Valuation as finally determined by the Neutral
Accountant. All costs and expenses incurred by the parties in connection with
resolving any dispute under this Section 1.7 before the Neutral Accountant
shall be borne by the party incurring such cost and expense. The Neutral
Accountant shall act as an arbitrator to determine only those issues still in
dispute at the end of the Sellers\' Review Period. The Neutral Accountant\'s
determination shall be made within forty-five (45) days after its engagement,
shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to the Sellers and Buyer
and shall be final, binding, conclusive and nonappealable for all purposes
hereunder. The term " _Final Scheduled Liabilities Valuation_ " shall mean the
aggregate value of the Scheduled Liabilities as agreed to by Sellers and Buyer
in accordance with Section 1.7(c) or the aggregate value of the Scheduled
Liabilities resulting from the determination made by the Neutral Accountant in
accordance with this Section 1.7(d) (in addition to those items theretofore
agreed to by Sellers and Buyer during the Resolution Period or otherwise in
accordance with Section 1.7(c)).

 

 

(e) If the Purchase Price is less than the Closing Payment, then the excess
portion of the Closing Payment over the Purchase Price shall be paid by the
Sellers to the Buyer. If the Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Payment, then
the excess portion of the Purchase Price over the Closing Payment shall be
paid by Buyer to the Sellers. The amount of any payment by Buyer or Sellers
pursuant to this Section 1.7(e) plus interest thereon from and including the
Closing Date but excluding the date of payment at the rate of 6.0% per annum
shall be paid by Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within five business days after the Final
Scheduled Liabilities Valuation is agreed to by Sellers and Buyer or is
determined by the Neutral Accountant in accordance with this Section 1.7.

 

 

Section 1.8 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

 

 

Section 1.9 Closing Prorations. The following shall be prorated at or promptly
following the Closing Date between the parties:

 

 

(a) Real Estate Taxes and Personal Property Taxes. Real estate Taxes
(including general and special assessments and water and sewerage charges) and
personal property Taxes (together, "2004 Property Taxes") for 2004 shall be
pro-rated between Sellers and Buyer by apportioning 2004 real estate Taxes
between Sellers and Buyer in proportion to the number of days in 2004 up to
and including the Closing Date, as to which such Taxes shall be the obligation
of Sellers, and the number of days in 2004 following the Closing Date, as to
which such Taxes shall be the obligation of Buyer and by apportioning 2004
personal property Taxes one-half to Buyer and one-half to Sellers. No more
than thirty (30) days before a payment of 2004 Property Taxes by Sellers,
whether in accordance with customary procedures for the payment of Property
Taxes, pursuant to audit findings or otherwise in accordance with applicable
law, Sellers shall provide Buyer with a copy of the relevant return,
assessment or other documentation or a certification of the amount of the
payment to be made within such thirty (30) day period (a "Payment
Certification"). At least one day before the due date of each payment of 2004
Property Taxes, Buyer shall pay to Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Sellers in writing, Buyer\'s share
of the total payment shown on such Payment Certification, as determined in
accordance with this Section 1.9(a). Sellers shall pay, and indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer against, all 2004 Property Taxes timely paid by Buyer to
Sellers in accordance with this Section 1.9(a), all 2004 Property Taxes
apportioned to Sellers in accordance with this Section 1.9(a) and all Property
Taxes with respect to periods prior to 2004. Buyer shall indemnify and hold
harmless Sellers against any liability in respect of 2004 Property Taxes
apportioned to Buyer pursuant to this Section 1.9(a) that are not timely paid
by Buyer to Sellers. This Section 1.9(a) shall survive the Closing until the
lapse of the latest statute of limitations applicable to 2004 Property Taxes.
**Buyer shall, promptly upon receipt, provide to Sellers all notices, bills,
assessments and other correspondence relating to 2004 Property Taxes or to
Property Taxes for any Tax period or portion thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date (or for any Tax period beginning before and ending after the
Closing Date to the extent allocable to the portion of such period up to and
including the Closing Date).

 **

 

(b) Real Property Transfer Taxes and Recording Fees. Sellers and Buyer shall
each pay one-half of any transfer Taxes and recording fees assessed on the
conveyance of the Real Property at Closing.

 

 

(c) Utilities. Sellers shall endeavor to have all meters read and final bills
rendered for all utilities servicing the Business including, without
limitation, water, sewer, gas and electricity, for the period to and including
the Closing Date. Sellers shall pay all bills for such utilities for the
period to and including the Closing Date by the due dates thereof. The
provisions of this Section shall survive the Closing for a period of one (1)
year.

 

 

(d) Personal Property Leases, Contracts and Agreements and Permits. Sellers
and Buyer shall make such prorations and adjustments under all Personal
Property Leases, Contracts and Agreements and Permits as shall be reasonably
necessary to reflect Sellers\' responsibility thereunder for the period of
time prior to and including the Closing and Buyer\'s responsibility thereunder
for the period of time after the Closing Date.

 

 

(e) Errors. If any errors or omissions are made at the Closing regarding
adjustments or prorations, the parties shall make the appropriate corrections
promptly after the discovery thereof. The provisions of this Section shall
survive the Closing for a period of one (1) year.

 

 

Section 1.10 Consent of Third Parties. Nothing in this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Transaction contemplated hereby shall be construed as an
attempt or agreement to assign any Asset, including any Contract and
Agreement, Permit, Real Property Lease, Personal Property Lease, certificate,
approval, authorization or other right, which by its terms or by applicable
law is nonassignable without the consent of a third party or a governmental
body or is cancelable by a third party in the event of an assignment ("
_Nonassignable Assets_ ") unless and until such consent, approval or
authorization, or replacement thereof, shall have been obtained. With respect
to such Nonassignable Assets, Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective
affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Buyer at its request for up to 180 days following the Closing Date in
endeavoring to obtain such consents promptly; provided, however, that such
efforts shall not require Sellers or any of their respective affiliates to
incur any actual out-of-pocket costs payable to any third party or provide any
financial accommodation or to remain secondarily or contingently liable for
any Assumed Liability to obtain any such consent. Buyer and Sellers shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be
obtained, any consent, substitution, approval or amendment required to novate
all Liabilities under any and all Contracts and Agreements or other
Liabilities that constitute Assumed Liabilities or to obtain in writing the
unconditional release of Sellers and their respective affiliates so that, in
any such case, Buyer shall be solely responsible for such Liabilities. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, in the event consents or approvals to the
assignment thereof cannot be obtained, such Nonassignable Assets shall be
held, as of and from the Closing Date, by Sellers or the applicable affiliate
of Sellers in trust for Buyer and the covenants and obligations thereunder
shall be performed by Buyer in Sellers\' or such affiliate\'s name and all
benefits and obligations existing thereunder shall be for Buyer\'s account.
Sellers shall take or cause to be taken at Buyer\'s expense such actions in
its name or otherwise as Buyer may reasonably request so as to provide Buyer
with the benefits of the Nonassignable Assets and to effect collection of
money or other consideration that becomes due and payable under the
Nonassignable Assets, and Sellers or the applicable affiliate of Sellers shall
promptly pay over to Buyer all money or other consideration received by it in
respect of all Nonassignable Assets. As of and from the Closing Date, each of
the Sellers on behalf of itself and its affiliates authorizes Buyer, to the
extent permitted by applicable law and the terms of the Nonassignable Assets,
at Buyer\'s expense, to perform all the obligations and receive all the
benefits of Sellers or their respective affiliates under the Nonassignable
Assets and appoints Buyer its attorney-in-fact to act in its name on its
behalf or in the name of the applicable affiliate of Sellers and on such
affiliate\'s behalf with respect thereto and Buyer agrees to indemnify and
hold Sellers and their respective affiliates, agents, successors and assigns
harmless from and against any and all Liabilities and Losses based upon,
arising out of or relating to Buyer\'s performance of, or failure to perform,
such obligations under the Nonassignable Assets, except for those Material
Contracts that are not identified on _Schedule 2.13_.

validly existing limited partnership, in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware, and has all requisite power and authority, partnership and
otherwise, to own, lease, use and operate its properties as now conducted.
Buyer (or a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer that is designated by Buyer
pursuant to Section 12.3 to carry out all or part of the Transaction) is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in
the State of Ohio.

 

 

Section 3.2 Partnership Power and Authority. Buyer has full power and
authority, partnership and otherwise, to execute and deliver this Agreement
and to carry out its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transaction contemplated hereby have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary partnership action of Buyer.
No other partnership acts or proceedings on the part of Buyer or its
unitholders are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the consummation of
the Transaction contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Buyer and, when duly executed and delivered by the Sellers,
this Agreement will constitute a valid and legally binding obligation of, and
will be enforceable against, Buyer in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be affected by principles of equity, bankruptcy,
insolvency, or creditor\'s rights.

 

 

Section 3.3 Conflicts, Consents and Approvals. Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the Transaction
contemplated hereby, nor compliance by Buyer with any of the provisions hereof
will (i) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, or any statute, rule or
regulation applicable to Buyer; (ii) violate any provision of the Certificate
of Partnership or Partnership Agreement of Buyer; or (iii) require any action
or consent or approval of, or review by, or registration with any third party,
court, or governmental body or another agency, instrumentality or authority,
other than as required by the HSR Act and consents for the assignment of the

effect on the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations under this Agreement
or to consummate the Transaction contemplated hereby. Buyer is not subject to
any order, injunction, judgment or decree of any governmental department,
commission, board or agency, except to the extent the same would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of
Buyer to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
Transaction contemplated hereby. Buyer is not presently engaged in or aware of
any situation which could subject Sellers or Buyer to any litigation,
arbitration, order, condemnation proceeding, claim or other legal proceeding

of this Agreement is consummated in accordance with the terms thereof, the
funds to be borrowed by Buyer, together with Buyer\'s available cash, will

the Transaction contemplated hereby. As of the date of this Agreement, to the
knowledge of Buyer, there are no facts or circumstances related to the
business, assets, operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects
of Buyer and its subsidiaries, or the Business, that create a basis for Buyer
to believe that Buyer will not obtain all of the financing contemplated by

Sections 8.1 and 8.2 of this Agreement.

 

 

Section 3.6 Broker and Finder\'s Fees. Buyer has not and will not incur any

representatives of Sellers to discuss matters relating to the Assets. Any such
investigation and examination shall be coordinated by Sellers and Buyer and
conducted during regular business hours upon reasonable advance notice subject
to restrictions under applicable law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no such investigation or examination shall be permitted to the
extent that it would require Sellers to disclose information subject to
attorney-client privilege or conflict with any confidentiality obligations to
which any of the Sellers is bound. To the extent Sellers believe that
privilege or their confidentiality obligations preclude Buyer\'s investigation
or examination under the foregoing sentence, they shall promptly provide Buyer
a privilege log detailing with reasonable specificity the topics and general
nature of the information withheld. If Buyer proposes a means that provides
reasonable assurance of protecting the information or privilege, Sellers shall
then promptly disclose the information at issue. Subject to these limitations,
Buyer and Buyer\'s agents will be given the right to perform and conduct any
and all necessary physical, engineering, environmental and other inspections
of the Assets and all other relevant agreements and documents relating to the
Assets as Buyer may reasonably request. Buyer shall restore the Assets to a
condition substantially similar to the condition such Assets were in prior to
any such testing. The parties hereby agree that such on-site inspections and
investigations shall only be conducted with the consent of and coordination by
Sellers.

customers, suppliers and others having business dealings with the Business.

 

 

(ii) use their commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the machinery,
equipment and rides primarily used or held for use in connection with the
Business in good operating and usable condition, and in a state of good

the beginning of the 2004 operating season for the Business.

 

 

(iii) notify Buyer of any material claims pertaining to the Business made in
respect of the Insurance Policies between the date hereof and the Closing
Date.

 

 

(iv) not enter into any Contract or Agreement of a type required to be
included on any Schedule hereto except Contracts and Agreements entered into

approved by Buyer, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

 

 

(b) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Sellers agree that they will
use their commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the business of the

Sellers, promptly notify Buyer of:

 

 

(a) any notice or other communication delivered or received by Parent or
Sellers (or their representatives) to or from any third party (other than
notices or other communications solely among Sellers\' representatives or
between Sellers and Buyer) which would reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect the ability of Parent or Sellers to consummate the
Transaction contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, any notice or
other communication to or from any third party objecting to, or alleging that
the consent of any person is or may be required in connection with, the
Transaction contemplated hereby);

 

 

(b) any event, condition or circumstance occurring from the date hereof
through the Closing Date that would constitute a material violation or breach
of any Sellers\' representation or warranty, whether made as of the date
hereof or as of the Closing Date, or that would constitute a material
violation or breach of any covenant of any party contained in this Agreement.

 

 

Section 4.5 Other Offers. From the date of this Agreement until it is
terminated in accordance with _Article XI_ , Parent and Sellers shall not, and

A.L.T.A. title insurance policy to insure fee simple marketable title, subject
to those matters described in Schedule B, Section II, of the Title Policy, to
Buyer of the Owned Real Property prepared by First American Title Insurance

material instruments referred to therein. The cost of obtaining the Title
Commitments shall be borne equally by the Sellers and the Buyer.

 

 

Section 4.7 Surveys. Sellers have delivered to Buyer copies of the Existing

after the Closing Date, but no later than June 11, 2004, each of the parties

shall be prepared by a licensed surveyor who shall certify the New Surveys in
favor of Sellers, Buyer and the Title Company. Subject to reasonable approval
of Sellers, Buyer and the Title Company, and consistent with applicable laws
and governmental requirements, the metes and bounds legal description of the
Owned Real Property contained in the Title Policy shall be used in the Deeds.
In the event that the metes and bounds legal description used in the Final

Title Policy and/or in the Deeds, the parties agree to use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Title Policy to be endorsed to
use the Final Survey Legal and Sellers will file corrective deeds to ensure
the vesting in Buyer of all Owned Real Property. The cost of obtaining the New
Surveys shall be borne equally by Sellers and the Buyer.

(including, but not limited to software related to the ticket system used in
the Business), which license shall apply solely to the Business. In addition,
Sellers shall assist Buyer in obtaining consents or licenses from third party
owners of such operating software which is licensed to Sellers and available
for use by the Business after the Transaction. In no event will Sellers be
obligated to make any payments in respect of securing for use by Buyer any
such software used in the operation of the Business.

 

 

Section 4.9 Title and Survey Objections/Cure of Title and Survey Objections.
Buyer has delivered to Sellers the written notice attached hereto as _Exhibit
E_ (the " _Initial Objection Letter_ ") listing all objections Buyer has to
matters contained in the Title Commitments and any matters shown on the
Initial Surveys (" _Pre-Closing Objections_ "); provided, however, that in no
event shall Buyer be entitled to raise any Objection with respect to Permitted
Exceptions. Furthermore, within fifteen (15) business days after receiving the
Final Survey, Buyer shall provide written notice (the " _Second Objection
Letter_ ," and, collectively with the Initial Objection Letter, the "
_Objection Letters_ ") of objections Buyer may have to matters shown on the
Final Survey, which shall exclude those matters which were depicted on the
Initial Surveys and those matters which constitute Permitted Exceptions ("
_Post-Closing Objections_ ," and, collectively with Pre-Closing Objections, "
_Objection(s)_ "). Sellers agree to cure any Objections which can be cured by
the payment of a fixed sum of money (such as mortgages, judgment liens and
mechanics liens) (" _Monetary Objections_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
or anything to the contrary set forth herein:

 

 

(a) Timing. If Buyer fails to notify Sellers of an objection within the time
provided herein, then Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted the Title Policy
and Surveys subject to such objection and the basis therefore and such
objection shall be deemed a Permitted Exception (except any Encumbrance to be
released at or before Closing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to notify Sellers of any Objection promptly
upon discovering the basis for such Objection, which shall in all events be no
later than the time period set forth above.

 

 

(b) Pre-Closing Objections. Sellers shall have until the Closing (or such
longer period requested by Sellers as Buyer may in writing approve) to cure or
remove, or have the Title Company insure over through Affirmative Assurance,
all or any Pre-Closing Objections. If Seller is unable to effect a cure,
removal or Affirmative Assurance of any Pre-Closing Objections prior to
Closing (or any date to which Closing has been adjourned), Buyer shall accept
conveyance of the Owned Real Property at Closing, subject to such Pre-Closing
Objection in which event any such uncured Pre-Closing Objection automatically
shall be deemed to be a Post-Closing Objection which shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 4.9(c), below; whereupon, Sellers shall convey the Owned
Real Property as required under this Agreement subject to the terms and
conditions contained herein.

 

 

(c) Post-Closing Objections. From and after the delivery of the Second
Objection Letter, Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
elect, on written notice (" _Cure Notice_ ") to the Sellers and Title Company
within six (6) months of the Closing Date, to cure or remove (" _Cure_ ") any
of the Post-Closing Objections, at Seller\'s sole cost and expense. Within
twenty (20) business days of receiving a Cure Notice, Sellers shall provide
Buyer with written notice setting forth, in reasonable specificity, Sellers\'
proposed method (" _Cure Plan_ ") to be used by Buyer, at Sellers\' sole cost
and expense, to effect such Cure.

 

 

Sellers agree to execute any and all affidavits or other documents (including,
without limitation, indemnification agreements) reasonably required by the
Title Company in order for the Title Company to issue the Title Policy as
required by this Agreement and to otherwise remove and/or cure any and all
Post-Closing Objections and as to those Post-Closing Objections that cannot be
removed or cured by the Title Company, to provide affirmative assurance to
Buyer in form and substance acceptable to Buyer including, without limitation,
affirmative assurance in respect of any encroachments against forced removal,
forfeiture or reversion of title of any Improvements (the " _Affirmative
Assurance_ ").

 

 

(d) Indemnification. In the event Sellers are not able or willing to cure any
Post-Closing Objection and the Title Company is unable or unwilling to provide
the Affirmative Assurance, then Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless
Buyer and Buyer\'s Indemnified Persons from and against all Losses with
respect thereto as provided under Sections 9.2 and 9.5(g) of this Agreement,
and subject to the terms thereof.

 

 

Section 4.10. Disclosure Schedules. Sellers may, at their option, include in
the Schedules items that are not material in order to avoid any
misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts,
shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or representation that such items
are material, to establish any standard of materiality or to define further
the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement. All matters
disclosed in a Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed in each Schedule to
which it is, upon review of all Schedules, reasonably apparent that such
matters relate.

for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date and shall make such
records available to the Buyer as may be reasonably required by such party in

proceedings or tax audits against or governmental investigations of Buyer or
any of its respective affiliates in order to enable Buyer to comply with its
respective obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement, document
or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby. In the event Sellers wish to

ARTICLE IX 
 Survival and Indemnity

 

 

Section 9.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations
and warranties of each party contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing Date for a period of eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the representations and warranties of
Sellers contained in Sections 2.1 (relating to organization and standing of
Parent and Sellers), 2.2 (Corporate Power and Authority), 2.3 (Conflicts,
Consents and Authority) and 2.4 and 2.5 (Title) shall survive indefinitely;
(ii) the representations and warranties of Sellers contained in Section 2.8
(relating to environmental matters) and 2.15 (Employee Matters) shall survive
for a period of four years following the Closing Date, and (iii) the
representations and warranties of Sellers contained in Section 2.14 (relating
to Taxes) and the obligation to indemnify in respect thereof shall survive the
Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations,
after giving effect to any extensions or waivers, (in each case, the "
_Survival Period_ "). No Claim for indemnification under Sections 9.2 and 9.3
with respect to the representations and warranties of each party contained in
this Agreement shall be made unless a Claim Notice has been delivered to the
Indemnifying Party within the applicable Survival Period, except that any
Claim relating to Section 2.14 (relating to Taxes) may be asserted until 60
days after the expiration of the applicable Survival Period. Notwithstanding
the expiration of any Survival Period, if a Claim Notice has been given by
Buyer to Sellers with respect to a representation or warranty of Parent and/or
Sellers within the applicable Survival Period, then the relevant
representation or warranty shall survive, solely as to such Claim as is
asserted in the Claim Notice, until such Claim has been finally resolved.

 

 

Section 9.2 Indemnity by Parent and Sellers. Subject to the survival periods
set forth in Section 9.1 and the claim procedures set forth in Section 9.5
hereof, Parent and Sellers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer, its successors and assigns, and its officers, directors,
employees, agents and affiliates (" _Buyer\'s Indemnified Persons_ "), against
any Losses actually incurred as the result of (a) a breach of any
representation or warranty by Sellers contained in this Agreement or the other
agreements to be delivered in connection with the closing of this Transaction;
(b) a breach of the covenants and agreements of Sellers contained in this
Agreement or the other agreements to be delivered in connection with the
closing of this Transaction; (c) any Excluded Liabilities; (d) enforcement of
this Section 9.2; (e) Liabilities arising from Prepaid Revenue to the extent
not previously reflected in the Final Scheduled Liabilities Valuation; and (f)
any Losses that are incurred in connection with any Claim made by the holder
of any undivided fee simple interest in Parcel 6 of the Campground Property,
including, without limitation, any cost incurred by Buyer in foreclosing on
such interest; or (g) the Post-Closing Objections as specifically set forth in
Section 4.9(c); _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to any Claims of
Buyer for Losses pursuant to Section (a) above (other than for Losses in
respect of a breach of Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.14), neither
Parent nor Sellers shall be liable for any such Losses unless the aggregate
amount of all such Losses resulting to the Buyer\'s Indemnified Persons from
all such breaches or claims exceeds $1,500,000 (the " _Allowance_ "), and then
Parent and Sellers shall be liable for all such amounts starting from the
first dollar. In no event shall the aggregate indemnification to be paid by
Parent and Sellers with respect to Claims for Losses resulting from the Second
Objection Letter pursuant to Section 4.9(c) and pursuant to Section (a) above
(other than for Losses in respect of a breach of Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4,
2.5, 2.14 and 5.5) exceed $30,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "). Regardless of any
limitations set forth elsewhere in this Agreement (including, without
limitation, those in this Section 9.2), Parent and Sellers shall defend,
indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from and against Losses incurred to complete
the project identified on _Schedule 9.2_ (the " _Scheduled Project_ ").

 

 

Section 9.3 Indemnity by Buyer. Subject to the survival periods set forth in
Section 9.1 and the claim procedures set forth in Section 9.5 hereof, Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless each of Parent and Sellers, their respective
successors and assigns, and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents and affiliates (" _Sellers\' Indemnified Persons_ ") against any Losses
which any of Sellers\' Indemnified Persons may suffer, sustain or become
subject to, as the result of (a) a breach of any representation or warranty by
Buyer contained in this Agreement or the other agreements to be delivered in
connection with the Closing of this Transaction; (b) a breach of the covenants
and agreements of Buyer contained in this Agreement or the other agreements to
be delivered in connection with the closing of this Transaction; (c) any
Assumed Liabilities; or (d) enforcement of this Section 9.3; provided,
however, that, with respect to any Claims of Buyer for Losses pursuant to
Section (a) above (other than for Losses in respect of a breach of Sections
3.1, 3.2 and 3.3), Buyer shall not be liable for any such Losses unless the
aggregate amount of all such Losses resulting to Sellers\' Indemnified Persons
from all such breaches or claims exceeds the Allowance set forth in Section
9.2, and then Buyer shall be liable for all such amounts starting from the
first dollar. In no event shall the aggregate indemnification to be paid by
Buyer with respect to any Claims of Buyer for Losses pursuant to Section (a)
above (other than for Losses in respect of a breach of Sections 3.1, 3.2 and
3.3) exceed the Cap.

 

 

Section 9.4 Tax Indemnity. Parent and Sellers, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify the Buyer from and against the entirety of any Losses the Buyer may
suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, or caused by any Liability
of the Parent or Sellers (a) for any Taxes of the Sellers for any Tax period
or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date (or for any Tax period
beginning before and ending after the Closing Date to the extent allocable to
the portion of such period up to and including the Closing Date) and (b) for
the unpaid Taxes of any Person (other than Sellers) under Treasury regulation
Sec. 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise. **Buyer shall, promptly
upon receipt, provide to Sellers all Tax notices, bills, assessments and other
correspondence relating to Taxes for any Tax period or portion thereof ending
on or before the Closing Date (or for any Tax period beginning before and
ending after the Closing Date to the extent allocable to the portion of such
period up to and including the Closing Date).

Section 9.5 Claims Procedure.

 

 

(a) Upon the occurrence of any event that a party hereto (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") asserts to be the basis for a claim for indemnification against the
other party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") under this Article IX (a " _Claim_
"), then the Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice (a " _Claim Notice_
") to the Indemnifying Party thereof in writing, which Claim Notice shall set
forth (i) a particular description of the event or condition that is the basis
for the Claim; and (ii) the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy such Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in
notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
obligation under this Agreement except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
thereby is prejudiced.

 

 

(b) If the Claim involves the claim of any third person (a " _Third-Party
Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and control
the defense of the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its own choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, so long as the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party of such defense in writing within thirty (30)
days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third-Party Claim and
the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third-Party Claim actively
and diligently; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may retain
separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the
defense of the Third-Party Claim; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Indemnified Party shall pay the fees and disbursements of such separate
counsel unless (i) the employment of such separate counsel has been
specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) the
Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice thereof with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, or (iii) the named parties
to the proceeding in which such Claim has been asserted include both the
Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party and, in the reasonable opinion
of counsel to such Indemnified Party, there exists one or more defenses that
may be available to the Indemnified Party that are in conflict with those
available to the Indemnifying Party.

 

 

(c) The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection
with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third-Party Claim.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.5 to the contrary: (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld),
unless as part of such judgment or settlement the Indemnified Party is
released in writing from all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim
and the business of the Indemnified Party will not become subject to any
restrictions or conditions not previously applicable to it or otherwise be
adversely affected, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not
to be unreasonably withheld) unless as part of such judgment or settlement the
Indemnifying Party is released in writing from all liability with respect to
such Third Party Claim and the business of the Indemnifying Party will not
become subject to any restrictions or conditions not previously applicable to
it or otherwise be adversely affected.

 

 

(d) In the event the Indemnifying Party does not assume and conduct the
defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance with Section 9.5(b), the
Indemnified Party may defend against the Third-Party Claim in any manner it
reasonably may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult
with or obtain any consent from the Indemnifying Party in connection
therewith).

 

 

(e) Whenever the Indemnified Party shall have given a Claim Notice to the
Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party may, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such Claim Notice, notify
the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party disputes the Claim for
indemnification set forth in such Claim Notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). If,
with respect to the claim for indemnification set forth in a Claim Notice, no
Dispute Notice is given to the Indemnified Party within such thirty (30) day
period, the Claim shall be deemed valid, and the Indemnifying Party shall be
obligated to pay to the Indemnified Party the amount specified in the Claim
Notice with respect to such Claim. If a Dispute Notice is given to the
Indemnified Party, the dispute that is the subject of such notice shall be
resolved as follows: The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
first attempt to resolve the dispute through a good faith discussion of the
Claim. If such discussion does not result in a resolution acceptable to either
the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, either party may resort to
any remedies available in law or in equity in a court of competent
jurisdiction.

 

 

(f) Regardless of any other provisions to the contrary, Buyer shall undertake,
direct and control any work not completed by Closing related to the Scheduled
Project identified on _Schedule 9.2_. In conducting such work, Buyer shall act
in a commercially reasonable manner at all times and shall provide Parent and
Sellers with reasonable advance notice of and the opportunity to comment on
its planned approach to the Scheduled Project. Buyer shall also provide Parent
and Sellers access to monitor the performance of its work on the Scheduled
Project and copies of all substantive correspondence and reports. Anything in
this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Sellers shall have no
Liability to Buyer with regard to either (i) any Environmental Condition
within the area of the Business commonly known as Hook\'s Lagoon identified on
Exhibit F hereto ("Hook\'s Lagoon") that was either known to Buyer on the
Closing Date or should have been known to Buyer on such date following a
reasonable investigation or inquiry regarding Hook\'s Lagoon (it being
understood that such Environmental Conditions do not include any condition
that was reasonably discoverable only with physical sampling of soil or
groundwater unless actually known to Buyer) or (ii) the condition of any of
the Tangible Personal Property or Improvements located within Hook\'s Lagoon.

 

 

(g) If any Party is obligated to pay the cost of remediating or addressing any
fact or condition affecting the Business or its operations to satisfy its
indemnification obligations under this Agreement:

 

 

(i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall consult with one
another as to the design and conduct of any work associated with such
remediation; and

 

 

(ii) if the parties are unable to agree as to the design and conduct of any
such work within 30 days of the initial consultation referred to in clause (i)
above, then the Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for any costs in
excess of those required by the design and conduct of such work if undertaken
in the most practicable, cost effective and commercially reasonable manner
consistent with the use and operation of the assets as an amusement park, and
in a commercially reasonable manner that causes the least practicable
disruption of the ordinary course of business.

 

 

Section 9.6 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Each of Parent, Sellers and
Buyer agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Article IX_
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign
income tax purposes.

 

Section 9.7 Calculation of Losses.

 

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Article IX shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified
Party under insurance policies or otherwise with respect to such Losses.

 

 

(b) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Article IX shall be increased to take account of any net Tax cost incurred by
the Indemnified Party resulting from the receipt of indemnity payments
hereunder and reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit realized by the
Indemnified Party resulting from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss or
that would be realized if the proceeds of such indemnity payment were used to
ameliorate the circumstance that gave rise to the Indemnification Claim (in
each case, grossed-up and -down as appropriate in respect of changes in the
actual amount of the indemnity payment resulting from adjustments pursuant to
this Section 9.7). To the extent payment of such Claim does not give rise to a
Tax cost currently payable by the Indemnified Party, if payment of the Claim
gives rise to a Tax cost subsequently payable by the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the Indemnified Party the amount of such Tax cost
when, as, and if payable by the Indemnified Party (grossed-up and -down as
appropriate in respect of changes in the actual amount of the indemnity
payment resulting from adjustments pursuant to this Section 9.7). To the
extent such Claim does not give rise to a currently realizable Tax benefit, if
the amount with respect to which any Claim is made gives rise to a
subsequently realized Tax benefit to the Indemnified Party that made the
Claim, such Indemnified Party shall refund to the Indemnifying Party the
amount of such Tax benefit when, as and if realized (grossed-up and -down as
appropriate in respect of changes in the actual amount of the indemnity
payment resulting from adjustments pursuant to this Section 9.7). An
Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable efforts to maximize and accelerate
Tax benefits and to minimize and defer Tax costs whenever legally permissible.
For purposes of this Section 9.7, "Tax cost" means the amount by which the Tax
liability of the party (or group of entities including the party) is increased
(including by increase in gross income, reduction in deductions by virtue of
decreased tax basis or otherwise, reduction of refund or credit to which the
party would otherwise be entitled, or otherwise) plus any related interest,
penalty, or addition to tax payable to the relevant taxing authority as a
result of such Tax cost; and "Tax benefit" means the amount by which the Tax
liability of the party (or group of entities including the party) is or could
be reduced (including by reduction of gross income, availability of
deductions, reduction of income by virtue of increased tax basis or otherwise,
entitlement to refund, credit or otherwise) plus any related interest received
or reduction of interest payable directly related to such Tax benefit. For
purposes of this Section 9.7, "Tax benefits" and "Tax costs" shall be computed
as if Buyer were a corporation subject to tax under Section 11 of the Code."
In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, the Indemnified
Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of
any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any
indemnified Loss. For purposes of this Section 9.7, a Tax cost is "currently
payable" to the extent that such Tax cost relates to the current taxable
period or year or any Tax Return with respect thereto or to any taxable period
or year prior to the date of the Claim; and a Tax benefit is "currently
realizable" to the extent that such Tax benefit could be realized in the
current taxable period or year or in any Tax Return with respect thereto
(including through a carryback to a prior taxable period) or in any taxable
period or year prior to the date of the Claim. The amount of any increase,
reduction or payment hereunder shall be adjusted to reflect any final
determination with respect to the Indemnified Party\'s liability for Taxes,
and payments between the parties to this Agreement to reflect such adjustment
shall be made if necessary. For purposes of determining the amount of any Tax
cost or Tax benefit hereunder, the receipt of an indemnity payment shall be
treated as an adjustment to the basis of the asset or assets upon which the
underlying Claim that gave rise to the indemnity payment was based and payment
of an indemnified claim, if required to be capitalized, shall be treated as an
adjustment to the basis of the same asset or assets. If the Internal Revenue
Service asserts that such basis adjustments were not properly made, the
Indemnified Party shall make such additional adjustments as are necessary to
minimize and defer Tax costs and maximize and accelerate Tax benefits, unless
precluded from doing so by a final determination with respect to the
Indemnified Party or any of its affiliates or unless it is advised, by written
opinion of a tax adviser reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party,
which opinion shall be made available to the Indemnifying Party, that any
further adjustment is inappropriate. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if the application of this Section 9.7(b) to an indemnity payment
owed by Sellers hereunder would increase the amount owed by Sellers, Sellers
shall be liable to Buyer for such increased amount only if Buyer could not
avoid such increased Tax cost by foregoing its payment of the indemnified
Claim and instead providing Sellers the opportunity to pay such Claim
directly. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood between the parties
that, regardless of against whom a liability is asserted, if it is feasible
for the liability to be paid by Sellers, the decision as to whether the
liability will be paid directly by Sellers to the claimant or paid by Sellers
to Buyer as an indemnity and then paid by Buyer to the claimant shall be made
by Sellers, provided that a Seller informs Buyer of this decision in writing
before the liability is paid.

 

 

Section 9.8 Exclusive Remedy. The sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or
inaccuracy or alleged breach or inaccuracy, of any representation or warranty
in this Agreement or any covenant or agreement in this Agreement to be
performed on or prior to the Closing Date, shall be indemnification in
accordance with this _Article IX_.

thereof on account of any "qualifying event" that occurs on or before the
Closing Date. Buyer shall be responsible for satisfying such COBRA coverage
obligations to or with respect to any Transferred Employee (and/or a dependent
thereof) on account of any "qualifying event" which occurs after the Closing
Date.

 

 

Section 10.6 Severance. Sellers shall be responsible for any and all severance
obligations or Liabilities in connection with the termination of employment of
