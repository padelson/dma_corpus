<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;Upon the occurrence of any event that a party hereto (the &quot;<U>Indemnified Party</U>&quot;) asserts to be the basis for a claim for indemnification against the other party (the &quot;<U>Indemnifying Party</U>&quot;) under this Article IX (a &quot;<U>Claim</U>&quot;), then the Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice (a &quot;<U>Claim Notice</U>&quot;) to the Indemnifying Party thereof in writing, which Claim Notice shall set forth (i) a particular description of the event or condition that is the basis for the Claim; and (ii) the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy such Claim; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation under this Agreement except to the extent the Indemnifying Party thereby is prejudiced.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;If the Claim involves the claim of any third person (a &quot;<U>Third-Party Claim</U>&quot;), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and control the defense of the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its own choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, so long as the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party of such defense in writing within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third-Party Claim actively and diligently; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third-Party Claim; and <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that the Indemnified Party shall pay the fees and disbursements of such separate counsel unless (i) the employment of such separate counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, or (iii) the named parties to the proceeding in which such Claim has been asserted include both the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party and, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such Indemnified Party, there exists one or more defenses that may be available to the Indemnified Party that are in conflict with those available to the Indemnifying Party.  </P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&#9;The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third-Party Claim.  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.5 to the contrary:  (i)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld), unless as part of such judgment or settlement the Indemnified Party is released in writing from all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim and the business of the Indemnified Party will not become subject to any restrictions or conditions not previously applicable to it or otherwise be adversely affected, and (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnified Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld) unless as part of such judgment or settlement the Indemnifying Party is released in writing from all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim and the business of the Indemnifying Party will not become subject to any restrictions or conditions not previously applicable to it or otherwise be adversely affected.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&#9;In the event the Indemnifying Party does not assume and conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance with Section 9.5(b), the Indemnified Party may defend against the Third-Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult with or obtain any consent from the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e)&#9;Whenever the Indemnified Party shall have given a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such Claim Notice, notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party disputes the Claim for indemnification set forth in such Claim Notice (a &quot;<U>Dispute Notice</U>&quot;).  If, with respect to the claim for indemnification set forth in a Claim Notice, no Dispute Notice is given to the Indemnified Party within such thirty (30) day period, the Claim shall be deemed valid, and the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to pay to the Indemnified Party the amount specified in the Claim Notice with respect to such Claim.  If a Dispute Notice is given to the Indemnified Party, the dispute that is the subject of such notice shall be resolved as follows:  The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall first attempt to resolve the dispute through a good faith discussion of the Claim.  If such discussion does not result in a resolution acceptable to either the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, either party may resort to any remedies available in law or in equity in a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(f)&#9;Regardless of any other provisions to the contrary, Buyer shall undertake, direct and control any work not completed by Closing related to the Scheduled Project identified on <U>Schedule 9.2</U>.  In conducting such work, Buyer shall act in a commercially reasonable manner at all times and shall provide Parent and Sellers with reasonable advance notice of and the opportunity to comment on its planned approach to the Scheduled Project.  Buyer shall also provide Parent and Sellers access to monitor the performance of its work on the Scheduled Project and copies of all substantive correspondence and reports.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Sellers shall have no Liability to Buyer with regard to either (i) any Environmental Condition within the area of the Business commonly known as Hook's Lagoon identified on Exhibit F hereto ("Hook's Lagoon") that was either known to Buyer on the Closing Date or should have been known to Buyer on such date following a reasonable investigation or inquiry regarding Hook's Lagoon (it being understood that such Environmental Conditions do not include any condition that was reasonably discoverable only with physical sampling of soil or groundwater unless actually known to Buyer) or (ii) the condition of any of the Tangible Personal Property or Improvements located within Hook's Lagoon.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(g)&#9;If any Party is obligated to pay the cost of remediating or addressing any fact or condition affecting the Business or its operations to satisfy its indemnification obligations under this Agreement:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(i)&#9;the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall consult with one another as to the design and conduct of any work associated with such remediation; and</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(ii)&#9;if the parties are unable to agree as to the design and conduct of any such work within 30 days of the initial consultation referred to in clause (i) above, then the Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for any costs in excess of those required by the design and conduct of such work if undertaken in the most practicable, cost effective and commercially reasonable manner consistent with the use and operation of the assets as an amusement park, and in a commercially reasonable manner that causes the least practicable disruption of the ordinary course of business.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_Toc69198465">Section 9.6&#9;Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments.  Each of Parent, Sellers and Buyer agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this <U>Article&nbsp;IX</U> as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign income tax purposes.</A></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_Toc69198467">Section 9.7&#9;Calculation of Losses.  </A></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&#9;The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Article IX shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies or otherwise with respect to such Losses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&#9;The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Article IX shall be&nbsp;increased to take account of any net Tax cost incurred by the Indemnified Party resulting from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder and reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party resulting from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss or that would be realized if the proceeds of such indemnity payment were used to ameliorate the circumstance that gave rise to the Indemnification Claim (in each case, grossed-up and -down as appropriate in respect of changes in the actual amount of the indemnity payment resulting from adjustments pursuant to this Section 9.7).   To the extent payment of such Claim does not give rise to a Tax cost currently payable by the Indemnified Party, if payment of the Claim gives rise to a Tax cost subsequently payable by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the Indemnified Party the amount of such Tax cost when, as, and if payable by the Indemnified Party (grossed-up and -down as appropriate in respect of changes in the actual amount of the indemnity payment resulting from adjustments pursuant to this Section 9.7). To the extent such Claim does not give rise to a currently realizable Tax benefit, if the amount with respect to which any Claim is made gives rise to a subsequently realized Tax benefit to the Indemnified Party that made the Claim, such Indemnified Party shall refund to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such Tax benefit  when, as and if realized (grossed-up and -down as appropriate in respect of changes in the actual amount of the indemnity payment resulting from adjustments pursuant to this Section 9.7).  An Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable efforts to maximize and accelerate Tax benefits and to minimize and defer Tax costs whenever legally permissible.  For purposes of this Section&nbsp;9.7, &quot;Tax cost&quot; means the amount by which the Tax liability of the party (or group of entities including the party) is increased (including by increase in gross income, reduction in deductions by virtue of decreased tax basis or otherwise, reduction of refund or credit to which the party would otherwise be entitled, or otherwise) plus any related interest, penalty, or addition to tax payable to the relevant taxing authority as a result of such Tax cost; and &quot;Tax benefit&quot; means the amount by which the Tax liability of the party (or group of entities including the party) is or could be reduced (including by reduction of gross income, availability of deductions, reduction of income by virtue of increased tax basis or otherwise, entitlement to refund, credit or otherwise) plus any related interest received or reduction of interest payable directly related to such Tax benefit.  For purposes of this Section 9.7, &quot;Tax benefits&quot; and &quot;Tax costs&quot; shall be computed as if Buyer were a corporation subject to tax under Section 11 of the Code.&quot;  In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss.  For purposes of this Section&nbsp;9.7, a Tax cost is &quot;currently payable&quot; to the extent that such Tax cost relates to the current taxable period or year or any Tax Return with respect thereto or to any taxable period or year prior to the date of the Claim; and a Tax benefit is &quot;currently realizable&quot; to the extent that such Tax benefit could be realized in the current taxable period or year or in any Tax Return with respect thereto (including through a carryback to a prior taxable period) or in any taxable period or year prior to the date of the Claim.  The amount of any increase, reduction or payment hereunder shall be adjusted to reflect any final determination with respect to the Indemnified Party's liability for Taxes, and payments between the parties to this Agreement to reflect such adjustment shall be made if necessary.  For purposes of determining the amount of any Tax cost or Tax benefit hereunder, the receipt of an indemnity payment shall be treated as an adjustment to the basis of the asset or assets upon which the underlying Claim that gave rise to the indemnity payment was based and payment of an indemnified claim, if required to be capitalized, shall be treated as an adjustment to the basis of the same asset or assets.  If the Internal Revenue Service asserts that such basis adjustments were not properly made, the Indemnified Party shall make such additional adjustments as are necessary to minimize and defer Tax costs and maximize and accelerate Tax benefits, unless precluded from doing so by a final determination with respect to the Indemnified Party or any of its affiliates or unless it is advised, by written opinion of a tax adviser reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, which opinion shall be made available to the Indemnifying Party, that any further adjustment is inappropriate.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the application of this Section 9.7(b) to an indemnity payment owed by Sellers hereunder would increase the amount owed by Sellers, Sellers shall be liable to Buyer for such increased amount only if Buyer could not avoid such increased Tax cost by foregoing its payment of the indemnified Claim and instead providing Sellers the opportunity to pay such Claim directly.  For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood between the parties that, regardless of against whom a liability is asserted, if it is feasible for the liability to be paid by Sellers, the decision as to whether the liability will be paid directly by Sellers to the claimant or paid by Sellers to Buyer as an indemnity and then paid by Buyer to the claimant shall be made by Sellers, provided that a Seller informs Buyer of this decision in writing before the liability is paid.</P>
