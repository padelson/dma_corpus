jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the

such Founder or Buyer are necessary to authorize such Founder's or Buyer's

such Founder or Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by each Founder and Buyer. Assuming the
due and valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
other Parties hereto, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each Founder and Buyer, enforceable against such Founder
and Buyer in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exclusion.

Section 3.03 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Neither the

consummation by such Founder or Buyer of the transactions contemplated
hereby, will (a) conflict with or violate any provision of any
Organizational Documents of any Founder or Buyer; (b) result in a breach of,

properties or assets may be bound; (c) violate any Laws applicable to any
Founder or Buyer or any of the properties or assets of any Founder or
Buyer; (d) require on the part of any Founder or Buyer any filing or

or Buyer, except, in the cases of clauses (b) through (e) of this _Section
3.03_ , as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

Section 3.04 _Ownership_.

  



  

(a) Except for (i) this Agreement and the other Transaction

neither Buyer nor any Founder has (A) granted any outstanding options,

exercisable for, any Equity Interests of Buyer; (B) entered into any Contracts
relating to the issuance, sale, transfer, voting or registration of any
Equity Interests of Buyer, or options, warrants, rights or other securities
convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, any of the foregoing;

participation or similar rights (in each case as to which Buyer has any
outstanding liabilities or obligations).

  



  

(b) Each Founder is the holder of the Acquired SPAC Interests set
forth across such Founder's name on _Annex III_ attached hereto, and, at the
Closing, assuming the performance by Priority of its obligations under
_Section 2.05(a)_ , the Acquired SPAC Interests will be free and clear of all
Liens (other than Permitted Liens).

  



  

Section 3.05 _Proceedings; Orders_. There are no Proceedings pending
or, to the Knowledge of Founders, threatened, against any Founder, nor are
there any Orders naming any Founder, or by which any Founder is bound, which
remain outstanding or unsatisfied, except, in each case, as would not

Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 3.06 _Brokers or Finders_. There is no investment banker,
broker, finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is
authorized to act on behalf of Founders or Buyer who might be entitled to any
fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 8.02 _Amendments and Modifications_. Any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument signed by
each Party.

  



  

Section 8.03 _Waiver_. No waiver hereunder shall be valid or binding
unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the Party against whom
enforcement of the waiver is sought. Any such waiver shall constitute a
waiver only with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and
shall in no way impair the rights of the Party granting such waiver in any
other respect or at any other time. Neither the waiver by any Party of a
breach of or a default under any provision of this Agreement, nor the failure
by any Party, on one or more occasions, to enforce any provision of this
Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed
as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a
waiver of any such provision, right or privilege hereunder.

  



  

Section 8.04 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation,
negotiation and execution of this Agreement, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any advisor fees and expenses,
whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, shall be
paid by the Person incurring such cost or expense; _provided_ that, for
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 8.04_ shall impair a Party's
rights under _Section 7.02_ in the event this Agreement has been validly
terminated, and the other Party had materially breached this Agreement prior
to the time of such termination.

  



  

Section 8.05 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any Party (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
Party, and any purported assignment without such consent shall be null and
void _ab initio_ ;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, Priority may assign any of its rights, interests or
obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliates.

  



  

Section 8.06 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement will be binding
upon, inure solely to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, except to the extent
otherwise provided in _Section 8.12_.

  



  

Section 8.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed,
performed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware
(without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws to the
extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of the
Laws of another jurisdiction) as to all matters, including matters of
validity, construction, effect, performance and remedies.

  



  

Section 8.08 _Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding with
respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of
this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by
the other Party or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined
exclusively in the United State District Court for the District of Delaware
or any state court sitting in the City of Wilmington in the State of Delaware.
Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such
Proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally
and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any Proceeding relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the aforesaid
courts. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that service of process, summons,

provided in _Section 8.01_ shall be effective service of process against them
for any such Proceeding brought in any of the aforesaid courts.

  



  

   

 11

 



    



  

(b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding with
respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for any reason other than the
failure to serve in accordance with _Section 8.01_ ; (ii) any claim that it or
its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from
any Proceeding commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise); and (iii) to the fullest
extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (A) such Proceeding in
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum; (B) the venue of such
Proceeding is improper; or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts.

  



  

Section 8.09 _Waiver of Jury Trial._

  



  

(a) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM
THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE, IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THIS WAIVER MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER
ORALLY OR IN WRITING (OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY
REFERRING TO THIS _Section_ _8.09(a)_ AND EXECUTED BY EACH PARTY). THIS
WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR
MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS OR DOCUMENTS RELATING
TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. The scope of this waiver is intended
to be all-encompassing of any and all disputes that may be filed in any court
and that relate to the subject matter of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including contract claims, tort claims, breach-of-duty claims and all
other common law and statutory claims. In the event of litigation, this
Agreement may be filed as a written consent to a trial by the court.

  



  

(b) EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS; (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS; (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY; AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,

Section 8.10 _Relationship of the Parties_. The Parties agree that this
is an arm's length transaction in which the Parties' undertakings and
obligations are limited to the performance of their obligations under this
Agreement. Priority acknowledges that it is a sophisticated investor and that
it has only a contractual relationship with each Founder, based solely on the
terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement, and that there is no special relationship of trust
or reliance between any Founder and Priority.

  



  

Section 8.11 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original,
with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the
same instrument. In the event that any signature to this Agreement is
delivered by facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery of a portable
document format (.pdf or similar format) data file, such signature shall
create a valid and binding obligation of the Party executing (or on whose
behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such
facsimile or ".pdf" signature page were an original thereof. This Agreement
shall become effective when each Party shall have received a counterpart
hereof signed by the other Party. Until and unless each Party has received
a counterpart hereof signed by the other Party, this Agreement shall have no
effect and no Party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by
virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication).

  



  

Section 8.12 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. The
representations, warranties and agreements of the Parties contained herein
are intended solely for the benefit of the Party to whom such
representations, warranties or agreements are made, and shall confer no
rights hereunder, whether legal or equitable, in any other Person, and no
other Person shall be entitled to rely thereon.

  



  

Section 8.13 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the
Contribution Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the other
documents and instruments referred to herein and therein) and the
Confidentiality Agreement set forth the entire agreement and understanding of
the Parties in respect of the Contemplated Transactions and supersede all
prior discussions, negotiations, agreements, arrangements and understandings,
whether oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
There are no warranties, representations or other agreements between the
Parties in connection with the subject matter hereof, except as specifically
set forth herein, or in the Contribution Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents, or in the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.14 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

   

 13

 



    



  

Section 8.15 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and
Covenants_. No representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
herein or in any instrument or certificate delivered by any Party at Closing
will survive the Closing or termination of this Agreement, and no Party shall
have any liability to the other Party after the Closing for any breach
thereof, except for covenants and agreements that contemplate
performance after the Closing or after the termination of this Agreement or
otherwise expressly by their terms survive the Closing or termination of this
Agreement, will survive in accordance with its terms, _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this  _Section 8.15_ shall impair a Party's
rights under _Section 7.02_ in the event this Agreement has been
validly terminated, and the other Party had materially breached this
Agreement prior to the time of such termination.

  



  

Section 8.16 _Remedies_.

  



  

(a) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that irreparable injury to
the other Party would occur if any provision hereof were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that such
injury would not be adequately compensable in damages because of the
difficulty of ascertaining the amount of damages that would be suffered in the
event that this Agreement were breached. It is accordingly agreed that,
subject to the further provisions of this _Section 8.16_ , prior to the
valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01_ , each Party
shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which it is entitled at
law or in equity, to specific enforcement of, and injunctive relief, without
proof of actual damages, to prevent any breach or violation of, the terms
hereof, and the other Party shall not take action, directly or indirectly,
in opposition to the Party seeking such relief on the grounds that any other
remedy or relief is available at law or in equity. Any requirements for the
securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are hereby waived.

  



  

(b) The Parties agree that in no case shall either Party be entitled
to any indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive or special
damages (including loss of future revenue, lost profits, diminution in value
or multiple of earnings damages) in connection with any claim arising out of
or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 8.17 _Representation by Counsel_. Each Party acknowledges to
the other that it has been represented by independent legal counsel of its own
choice throughout all of the negotiations that preceded the execution of this
Agreement. Each Party further acknowledges that it and its counsel have had
adequate opportunity to make whatever investigation or inquiry they may deem
necessary or desirable in connection with the subject matter of this
Agreement prior to the execution hereof.

  



  

Section 8.18 _Rules of Construction_. The Parties have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of
the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

  



  

   

 14

 



    



  

Section 8.19 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement, and the Table of Contents are for convenience of the Parties only,
and shall be given no substantive or interpretative effect whatsoever.

  



  

Section 8.20 _Inconsistencies with Other Agreements_. In the event of
any inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and
those in the other Transaction Documents (other than the Contribution
Agreement) referred to herein, the provisions in the body of this Agreement
will prevail and govern;  _provided_ , _however_ , in the event of any
inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and
those in the Contribution Agreement, the provisions in the body of the
Contribution Agreement will prevail and govern.

doubt, nothing in this _Section 8.21(i)_ is intended to authorize, nor shall
it be deemed to have authorized, any assignment or transfer not otherwise
permitted by this Agreement.

  



  

   

 15
