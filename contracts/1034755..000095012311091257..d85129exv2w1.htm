the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable

counsel) and to participate in any discussions with the SEC or its staff
regarding any such comments.

 2.3 _Company Board of Directors and Committees; Section 14(f) of Exchange Act_. 

  

 (a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_. Effective upon the Acceptance Time (provided that the Minimum Condition has been satisfied), the use of which term herein shall not, unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether Parent shall exercise its rights under this _Section 2.3(a)_) and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to elect or designate up to such number of directors on the Company Board equal to the product (rounded up to the next whole number) obtained by multiplying (x) the number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this  _Section 2.3_) and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and Merger Sub (giving effect to the 

   ##### 

  

 

shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer),
and the denominator of which is the total number of then outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock. Following a request by Parent, the Company shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Laws and the certificate of incorporation
of the Company, take at the Companys expense all action necessary to cause
the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the
Company Board, including (at the election of Parent) by increasing the size
of the Company Board or by seeking and accepting or otherwise securing the
resignations of such number of then incumbent directors as is necessary to
enable the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to
the Company Board. From time to time after the Acceptance Time, at the
request of Parent, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Laws and the certificate of incorporation of the Company, take all
action necessary to cause the individuals so designated by Parent to
constitute substantially the same percentage (rounding up where appropriate)
as is on the Company Board on (i) each committee of the Company Board, (ii)
each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company and (iii)
each committee of each such board of directors of each Subsidiary of the
Company, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the
continued listing requirements of NASDAQ. The Company shall promptly amend,
or cause to be amended, its bylaws, if necessary, to comply with
the obligations of the Company pursuant to this _Section 2.3_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, from the Acceptance Time until the Effective
Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company
Board to always have at least three directors who are directors on the date
hereof, who are not employed by the Company and who are not Affiliates or
employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and who are independent
directors for purposes of the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ and
Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act, and also eligible to serve on the Companys
audit committee under the Exchange Act and the continued listing standards of
NASDAQ and at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial
expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K and the
instructions thereto (the " _Continuing Directors_ ");  _provided_ that, if
the number of Continuing Directors shall be reduced below three for any
reason whatsoever, the remaining Continuing Director(s) shall be entitled to
designate any other Person(s) who shall not be an Affiliate or employee of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to fill such vacancies and such Person(s)
shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director(s) for purposes of this
Agreement; _provided further_ , that the remaining Continuing Director shall
fill such vacancies as soon as practicable, but in any event within
ten Business Days, and further _provided_ that if no such Continuing
Director(s) are appointed in such time period, Parent shall designate such
Continuing Director(s); _provided further_ , that if no Continuing Director
then remains, the other directors shall designate three Persons who shall
not be Affiliates, consultants, representatives or employees of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries to fill such vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed
to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Company shall promptly take all action required pursuant to this Section 2.3 and Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 2.3, shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its directors and officers, as well as Parents designees to the Company Board, as is required under Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. Parent shall provide to the Company in writing, and be solely 

   ##### 

  

 

responsible for, any information with respect to itself and its designees to
the Company Board required by such Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 thereunder. 

   

 (c) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Following the election or appointment of Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) (i) any amendment or termination of this Agreement on behalf of the Company, (ii) any amendment of this Agreement requiring action by the Company Board, (iii) any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, (iv) any exercise, enforcement or waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, (v) any other action to be taken or not to be taken on behalf of the Company in connection with this Agreement; and (vi) except as provided herein, to amend the governing documents of the Company. The Continuing Directors shall have the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company, and shall have the authority, after the Acceptance Time, to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce the performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

  

 (d) Following the Acceptance Time, the Company shall, upon Parents request, take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" as defined by the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ and make all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status. 

  

 2.4 _Top-Up Option_. 

  

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase, at a price per share equal to the Offer Price, that number of authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and/or Merger Sub at the time of such exercise, shall constitute 100 shares of Company Common Stock more than the number of shares of Company Common Stock necessary for Merger Sub to be merged into the Company without a vote or consent of the Companys stockholders in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable (i) unless immediately after such exercise and the issuance of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto, Merger Sub would own more than the number of shares of Company Common Stock necessary for Merger Sub to be merged into the Company without a vote or consent of the Companys stockholders in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) and (ii) for a number of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of the number of then authorized and unissued shares together with shares of Company Common Stock held as treasury shares. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall be construed or is intended to obligate Merger Sub to exercise the Top-Up Option. 

  

 (b) Merger Sub may exercise the Top-Up Option, in whole but not in part, at any one time after the Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time 

   ##### 

  

 

and (ii) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article X_. The
aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares being purchased
by Merger Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option may be paid by Merger Sub, at its
election, either (A) entirely in cash or (B) by paying in cash in an amount
equal to the aggregate par value of the purchased Top-Up Option Shares and
executing and delivering to the Company an unsecured promissory note issued
by Merger Sub having a principal amount equal to the remainder of such
purchase price. The promissory note shall be full recourse against Parent and
Merger Sub, shall bear interest at a rate of 5% per annum, shall mature on
the first anniversary of the date of execution of the promissory note, and
may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty,
and shall have no other material terms. 

   

 (c) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company a notice (the " _Top-Up Notice_ ") setting forth (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries, (ii) the number of Top-Up Option Shares that Merger Sub intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (iii) the manner in which Merger Sub intends to pay the applicable purchase price and (iv) the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of such Top-Up Option Shares by Merger Sub is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Option Shares being purchased pursuant to the Top-Up Option, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing such Top-Up Option Shares and upon request of Parent, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its transfer agent to certify in writing the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The parties hereto agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the purchase of such Top-Up Option Shares to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice is deemed received by the Company pursuant to _Section 11.2_, and if not so consummated on such day, as promptly thereafter as possible. The parties further agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL and as contemplated by _Section 8.3(e)_ as close in time as possible to (including, to the extent possible, on the same day as) the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. 

  

 (d) Parent and Merger Sub understand that the shares of Company Common Stock which Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act. Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Option Shares shall include any legends required by applicable securities Laws. 

  

 (e) _No Effect on Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the parties hereto 

   ##### 

  

 

agrees and acknowledges that in any appraisal proceeding under Section 262 of
the DGCL with respect to the Dissenting Company Shares, the Surviving
Corporation shall not assert that the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Option Shares
or any cash or the promissory note delivered to the Company in payment
for such Top-Up Option Shares should be considered in connection with the
determination of the fair value of the Dissenting Company Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. 

   

 (f) _Assignment of Top-Up Option_. Without the prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement shall not be assigned by Merger Sub other than to Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, including by operation of Law or otherwise, and any attempted assignment in violation of this  _Section 2.4(f)_ shall be null and void.

Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and as to which the holders have properly demanded appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and have not effectively withdrawn such demand (collectively, " _Dissenting Company Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_, but rather such holders shall be entitled only to such rights and payments as are due in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that all Dissenting Company Shares held by holders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have otherwise waived, withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal with respect to such Dissenting Company Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall no longer be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares, shall be deemed to have been an Eligible Share and to have been cancelled and converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest. 

  

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

   ##### 

  

 

consideration of such cancellation and termination, each holder of each such
Company Option shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation at or promptly
after the Effective Time, an amount in cash (without interest), if any, equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) the Offer Price, less the
per share exercise price of such Company Option (the " _Option Consideration_
") (it being understood and agreed that such exercise price shall not actually
be paid to the Surviving Corporation by the holder of a Company Option). 

   

 (b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, any Company Restricted Stock Awards that vest as of or prior to the Acceptance Time shall be treated as shares of Company Common Stock for all purposes of this Agreement, including _Section 2.1_ and  _Section 3.7_, and may be tendered to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer. Each Company Restricted Stock Award under the Company Stock Plans that has not vested prior to the Effective Time, shall vest and all restrictions shall be removed from the shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, so that all shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Awards shall be treated as shares of Company Common Stock for all purposes of this Agreement, including  _Section 3.7_ from and after the date of such vesting.

   ##### 

  

  

 3.10 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Fund_. At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause Merger Sub to deposit) with a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ") an amount of cash sufficient in the aggregate to provide funds necessary to make payments to holders of Company Common Stock under  _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_ (such cash amount, excluding any interest or earnings thereon, being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such funds shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Any interest and other income or net profits resulting from such investments shall be promptly paid to Parent. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the consideration contemplated by  _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_, upon demand by the Payment Agent, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly reimburse any such loss so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make such payments contemplated by _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_. Upon Parent becoming aware that a holder of Dissenting Company Shares has effectively waived, withdrawn or lost such holders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Company Shares, Parent shall make available or cause to be made available to the Payment Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of such Dissenting Company Shares and (y) the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record as of the Effective Time of (i) a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock or (ii) shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry ("each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ "), in each case, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_ (x) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal), and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, or delivery to the Payment Agent of an "agents message" in respect of Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), the holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in the amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to _Section 3.10(d)_) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares represented by such holders properly surrendered Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, and (y) the per share Merger Consideration, and the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates and transferred Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest 

   ##### 

  

 

shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares.

information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as

involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting. Since December 31,
2008, (i) neither the Company nor any of the Companys Subsidiaries, nor to
the Knowledge of the Company, any director or executive officer of the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries has, and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, no other officer, employee or accountant of the Company or any
of the Companys Subsidiaries has, received any complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, in writing (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, orally)
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in improper,
illegal or fraudulent accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or
similar violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees
or agents to the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof
or to any director or officer of the Company.

 (e) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof will (i) fail to make, change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for the shares of Company Common Stock (other than the Offer) within ten Business Days after commencement of any such offer, (iii) take any action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection with any such offer, (iv) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, (v) make any public statement inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation, (vi) resolve or agree to take any of the actions described in subclauses (i) through (v) above (actions described in subclauses (i) through (vi) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change"_ ). 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.2(e)_, prior to, but not after, the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if prior to taking such action, the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that (A) in the case of an Acquisition Proposal such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (B) in response to an Intervening Event and in the absence of an Acquisition Proposal, that failure to take such action in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company Board shall not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 6.2(f)(A)_ unless prior to taking such action (i) the Company has given Parent at least three Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal)) and has contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of any proposed 

   ##### 

  

 

transaction agreements with the Person making such Superior Proposal, (ii)
the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate,
in good faith with Parent during such notice period to enable Parent to revise
the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal
to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, and (iii) the Company has
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this _Section
6.2_. It is understood and agreed that, upon the expiration of such notice
period, if the Company has not received from Parent a written proposal to
amend the terms of this Agreement that the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, to be at least as favorable, from a financial point of view, to the
Companys Stockholders as the Superior Proposal, the Company shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)(ii)_ at any
time thereafter. It is also understood and agreed that any amendment to
the financial terms or other material terms of a Superior Proposal after
delivery of a notice in respect of such Superior Proposal shall require
delivery of another Notice and a three Business Day notice period in respect
of such Superior Proposal pursuant to _Section 6.2(f)_ shall commence. The
Company Board shall not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant
to  _Section 6.2(f)(B)_ unless prior to taking such action, (i) the Company
has given Parent at least three Business Days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action (which notice shall provide a detailed
description of the Intervening Event), (ii) the Company has negotiated, and
has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during
such notice period to enable Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement in
such a manner that would obviate the need for taking such action as a result
of such Intervening Event, (iii) following the end of such notice period, the
Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that notwithstanding such proposed changes, failure to take such
actions in response to an Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (iv) the Company
has complied in all material respects with its obligations under this
_Section 6.2_. No Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the
approval of this Agreement for purposes of Section 251 of the DGCL, and no
Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have the effect of causing
any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover statute or other similar
statute to be applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer, the Merger and the Tender and Voting Agreements). 

   

 (g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law, including (i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the Companys Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall any such requirement affect, eliminate or modify the obligations of the Company under, or the effect of any such actions under, this _Section 6.2_; and _provided_ , _further_ , that any such disclosure will be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such action. 

  

 (h) The Company shall promptly inform its Representatives who have been engaged or are otherwise providing assistance in connection with the transactions contemplated 

   ##### 

  

    

by this Agreement of the Companys obligations under this _Section 6.2_.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company acknowledges
and agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section
6.2_ by Representatives of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 6.2_ by the Company. 

  

 6.3 _Access to Information_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and third party license, joint operating or similar agreements, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives of Parent, reasonable access (including access to core samples, well logs and seismic data, in each case that are in the possession of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and including for the purpose of planning for post-merger integration activities and transition planning with the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries) during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all the properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, during such period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall furnish promptly all information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel, in each case as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no actions shall be required to be taken pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ that would create a risk of loss or waiver of any attorney-client privilege; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to allow for access and disclosure of information in a manner reasonably acceptable to Parent that does not result in the loss or waiver of the attorney-client privilege, violation of a contract or license, or a violation of Law (which efforts shall include entering into mutually acceptable joint defense agreements between the parties if doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of information without violating applicable law or jeopardizing such attorney-client privilege). All information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. No delivery of information or investigation shall affect the representations and warranties contained herein, or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (b) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the end of each calendar month prior to the Closing, provide Parent with the Companys internal monthly financial and operating data for such month. 

  

 6.4 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent of any litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its directors (in their capacity as such) by any Company Stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation and agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any such stockholder litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

  

 6.5 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated 

   ##### 

  

    

by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or executive officer of
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. 

  

ARTICLE VII 
 COVENANTS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB 

   

 7.1 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Companys Charter Documents, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the date hereof and disclosed in _Section 7.1_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and, in the event that any proceeding is pending or asserted or any claim made during such period, until the final disposition of such proceeding or claim. 

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, fees, expenses, judgments and fines arising in whole or in part out of actions or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a fiduciary under any Employee Plan or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture or other enterprise, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under applicable Law or the Companys Charter Documents, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement. The Indemnifying Parties shall advance each Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, fees, expenses, judgments and fines to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, subject to the Surviving Corporations receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation will not be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving Corporations prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, in consultation with Parent, and if the Company is unable to, Parent shall (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation co), as of the Effective Time, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six years from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms, conditions and levels of coverage that are not less advantageous to the 

   ##### 

  

    

directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries from an insurance
carrier with the same or better rating as the Companys insurance carrier as
of the date of this Agreement, in each case with respect to claims arising
out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time
(including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement). If such "tail" prepaid insurance policies have been obtained,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, after the Effective
Time to maintain such policies in full force and effect, for their full term,
and to continue to honor its respective obligations thereunder. If
the Company fails to obtain such "tail" prepaid insurance policies as of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of six
years after the Effective Time, if available, the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time ( _provided_ that the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
and amounts and containing terms that are not less advantageous to the
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries when compared to
the insurance maintained by the Company as of the date hereof from an
insurance carrier with the same or better rating as the Companys insurance
carrier as of the date of this Agreement); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in
no event will the Surviving Corporation be required, nor shall the Company
be permitted, to expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of 300%
of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to
the date of this Agreement, which amount is set forth on _Section 7.1(c)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance
coverage cannot be obtained at an annual premium equal to or less than the
Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation will obtain, and Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation to obtain, that amount of directors and officers
insurance (or "tail" coverage) obtainable for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Premium. 

  

 (d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 7.1_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 7.1_ applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 7.1_ applies and their heirs and legal representatives shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.1_, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this _Section 7.1_). 

  

 (e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties, rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this  _Section 7.1_. For six years after the Effective Time, the Indemnifying Parties agree, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to cause the Surviving Corporations (or any successors) Charter Documents to maintain the current provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors and indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors, officers and employees of the Company that are contained in the Companys Charter Documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether 

   ##### 

  

    

pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has
been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers, directors and
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this _Section 7.1_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such
claims under any such policies. 

  

 7.2 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control," or "change in control" or "fundamental change" within the meaning of the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Acceptance Time or Effective Time, as applicable. 

  

 (b) As of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor all Employee Plans and compensation arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, _provided_ that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating, or from causing the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate, any such Employee Plans, arrangements or agreements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required by applicable Law. The Company will take such action as it determines to be necessary or appropriate prior to the Effective Time to cause all participants in the Companys 401(k) plan to become fully vested in all of their account balances thereunder upon the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiary shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiary to) provide (i) at least the same level of base salary or base wages to each Continuing Employee as the base salary or base wages provided to each Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) benefits and severance payments (other than equity based benefits, change in control benefits and individual employment agreements) to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are substantially similar in the aggregate to the benefits and severance payments (other than equity based benefits, change in control benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to either similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries or similarly situated employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) The Company 2011 Performance Bonus Plan and the Company 2011 401(k) Matching Plan shall be continued on behalf of eligible Continuing Employees for the remainder of the 2011 calendar year based upon Company performance during 2011, with the resulting payments and contributions for 2011 to be made in the first quarter of 2012 similar to the timing of such payments and contributions in prior years. 

  

 (e) To the extent that an Employee Plan or employee benefit plan of Parent is made available to any Continuing Employee on or following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their predecessors) prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and 

   ##### 

  

 

entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including, but
not limited to, for purposes of vacation, sick and paid time off accrual and
severance pay entitlement); _provided, however_ , that such service need not
be credited (i) to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage
or benefits, (ii) to the extent service during a period is not
recognized under any such plan, or (iii) under any new plan or arrangement to
the extent that such plan or arrangement does not provide prior service
credit to employees generally. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time: (i) each Continuing
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Employee Plans) (such plans,
collectively, the " _New Plans_ ") to the extent coverage under any such New
Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Employee Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Acceptance Time (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability
benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall cause all
waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to
be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to
the extent such requirements had been met under the Old Plan which such New
Plan replaced, and the Surviving Corporation shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
given full credit under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan,
and (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall credit the accounts of such
Continuing Employees under any New Plan which is a flexible spending plan with
any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee under the
applicable Employee Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by
a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any Continuing Employee for any period of time, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee for any reason, or (ii) subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this _Section 7.2_, require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any Employee Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time provided that such action does not violate the terms and conditions of such Employee Plans or applicable Law. 

  

 (g) This _Section 7.2_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 7.2_, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 7.2_. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this  _Section 7.2_ will create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, director or consultant (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter, 

   ##### 

  

 

provided that nothing in this Agreement shall relieve the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries of their obligations to the
Continuing Employees (or any former employee) (who, together with their heirs
and legal representatives, shall be third party beneficiaries of
this Agreement) as the successor to the Company or its Subsidiaries under any
agreements disclosed on  _Section 7.2(g_) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports, or pursuant to the Company Change in
Control Plan, the Company Key Employee Change in Control Plan or the Company
Key Employee Change in Control Retention Plan adopted by the Company on
September 13, 2011 or any other plan, program, policy, agreement or
arrangement of the Company or its Subsidiaries, except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Agreement. 

   

 7.3 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Except as expressly contemplated by _Section 6.2(f)_ and  _Section 6.2(g)_, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation. The Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided, however_ , that no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

become effective as soon as practicable after the Acceptance Time without the
Company Stockholder Meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

 (1) (i) there shall be pending any Legal Proceeding by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction (A) seeking to enact, issue, promulgate, enforce or enter any Law or Order that has the effect of making the consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal or which has the effect of prohibiting, restraining or otherwise preventing the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or (B) seeking to impose, or requiring that the parties agree to, any conditions, restrictions or other measures necessary to satisfy the HSR Condition that would result, individually or in the aggregate, in any Adverse Regulatory Effect or (ii) there shall (x) be in effect any Law or Order that has the effect of making the consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal or which has the effect of prohibiting, restraining or otherwise preventing the consummation of the Merger or (y) have been imposed by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction any conditions, restrictions or other measures necessary to satisfy the HSR Condition that, individually or in the aggregate, result in any Adverse Regulatory Effect; 

  

 (2) (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the Agreement (other than those set forth in _Sections 2.2(a)_, _4.1(a)_ , _4.2_ ,  _4.5(a)_ , _4.5(b)_ , and _4.5(d)_ ) shall not have been true and correct in all respects as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such date (unless such representation or warranty expressly relates to an earlier date, in which case on and as of such earlier date), except for any failure to be so true and correct which has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any of the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 2.2(a)_, _4.1(a)_ , _4.2_ , _4.5(a)_ , _4.5(b)_ , and  _4.5(d)_ shall not be true and correct in all respects as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such date (unless such representation or warranty expressly relates to an earlier date, in which case on and as of such earlier date), except for any failures of the representations or warranties in _Sections 4.5(a)_ , _4.5(b)_ and _4.5(d)_ to be so true and correct which, individually or in the aggregate, are immaterial in nature or amount; _provided_ , _however,_ that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the Agreement for purposes of clause (i) above, all materiality and "Company Material Adverse 

  

Annex A-1  ##### 

  

    

Effect" qualifications set forth in such representations and warranties shall
be omitted and disregarded; 

  

 (3) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under the Agreement at or prior to the expiration of the Offer, except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter; 

  

 (4) any change, effect, occurrence, development or circumstance shall have occurred that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 (6) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. 

  

 The foregoing conditions shall be for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such conditions and may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, in each case except for the Minimum Condition and the HSR Condition, in its sole discretion, subject to the terms of this Agreement and applicable Law. Unless waived by Parent or Merger Sub in a notice to the Company, any shares of Company Common Stock subject to notices of guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be validly tendered for purposes of satisfying the Minimum Condition unless and until the shares underlying such notices of guaranteed delivery are delivered to or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub. Any reference in this _Annex A_ or elsewhere in the Agreement to a condition or requirement being satisfied shall be deemed to be satisfied if such condition or requirement is so waived. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right may be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time. Each of the foregoing conditions is independent of any of the other foregoing conditions; the exclusion of any event from a particular condition does not mean that such event may not be included in another condition.

ANNEX B 

   

FORM OF 

  

AMENDED AND RESTATED 

  

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 

  

OF 

  

BRIGHAM EXPLORATION COMPANY 

  

 FIRST: The name of the corporation is Brigham Exploration Company (the " _Corporation_ "). 

  

 SECOND: The address of its registered office in the State of Delaware is 1209 Orange Street, in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle 19801. The name of its registered agent at such address is The Corporation Trust Company. 

  

 THIRD: The nature of the business or purposes to be conducted or promoted is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "). 

  

 FOURTH: The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "). Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote. 

  

 FIFTH: Unless and except to the extent that the bylaws of the Corporation shall so require, the election of directors of the Corporation need not be by written ballot. 

  

 SIXTH: In furtherance of, and not in limitation of, the powers conferred by statute, the bylaws of the Corporation may be altered, amended or repealed and new bylaws may be adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board_ "), unless the bylaws of the Corporation limit or eliminate the Boards power to amend, alter or repeal the bylaws or to adopt new bylaws. 

  

 SEVENTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between the Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary way of the Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under Section 291 of the DGCL or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under Section 279 of the DGCL, order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a majority in number representing three fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of the Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the 

  

Annex B-1  ##### 

  

 

said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said
application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of
creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of the
Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the Corporation. 

   

 EIGHTH: _Elimination of Certain Liability of Directors_. (a) To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of duty as a director. Without limiting the foregoing in any respect, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this provision shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification. 

  

 (b) _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

   

 (i) _Right to Indemnification_. (A) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a " _proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or serves, in any capacity, any corporation, partnership or other entity in which the Corporation has a partnership or other interest, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators, and (B) the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless in such manner any person designated by the Board, or any committee thereof, as a person subject to this indemnification provision, and who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to a proceeding by reason of the fact that he, she or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was serving at the request of the Board of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another 

  

Annex B-2  ##### 

  

   

corporation or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
whether such request is made before or after the acts taken or allegedly
taken or events occurring or allegedly occurring which give rise to such
proceeding; provided, however, that except as provided in subsection (b)(ii)
of this Section, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person
seeking indemnification pursuant to this subsection in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding
(or part thereof) was authorized by the Board. The right to indemnification
conferred herein shall be a contract right based upon an offer from the
Corporation which shall be deemed to have been made to a person subject to
subsection (b)(i)(A) on the date hereof and to a person subject to
subsection (b)(i)(B) on the date designated by the Board, shall be deemed to
be accepted by such persons service or continued service as a director or
officer of the Corporation for any period after the offer is made and shall
include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in
defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided,
however, that if the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by
a director or officer in his or her capacity as the director or officer (and
not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person
while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an
employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding,
shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or
on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it
shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled
to be indemnified under this Section or otherwise. The Corporation may, by
action of the Board, provide indemnification to employees or agents of the
Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification
of directors and officers. 

   

 (ii) _Right of Claimant to Bring Suit_. If a claim under Section (b)(i) of this Article is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including the Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including the Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 

   

 (iii) _Nonexclusivity of Rights_. The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition 

  

Annex B-3  ##### 

  

    

conferred in this Section shall not be exclusive of any right which any person
may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate
of Incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise. 

   

 (iv) _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL. 

   

 (v) _Nature of Rights_. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this Article EIGHTH shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article EIGHTH that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit, eliminate, or impair any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal. 

   

 (vi) _Severability_. If any subsection of this Section (b) shall be deemed to be invalid or ineffective in any proceedings, the remaining subsections hereof shall not be affected and shall remain in full force and effect. 

  

 NINTH: The Corporation shall have the right, subject to any express provisions or restrictions contained in this Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of the Corporation, from time to time, to amend this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision hereof in any manner now or hereafter provided by law, and all rights and powers of any kind conferred upon a director or stockholder of the Corporation by this Certificate of Incorporation or any amendment hereof are subject to such right of the Corporation.
