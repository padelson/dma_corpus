 **STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

  



  

 **THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT** (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of August 15, 2010 among (i) Veeco Instruments Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Seller_ "); (ii) Veeco Metrology Inc., an Arizona
corporation (the " _Company_ "); and (iii) Bruker Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the " _Buyer_ "). The Seller, the Company and the Buyer
are referred to herein collectively as the " _Parties_ " and individually as
a " _Party_ ".

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , the Seller is the record owner of all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Company;

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
the Buyer desires to purchase from the Seller and the Seller desires to sell
to the Buyer all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company
(the " _Stock Purchase_ ");

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , the Company owns certain assets described on _Exhibit A_ (the
" _Company Selected Assets_ "), the Seller (or one of its Subsidiaries) owns
certain assets described on _Exhibit B_ (the " _Seller Selected Assets_ "),
and the Seller and the Company are simultaneously herewith entering into a
Contribution and Distribution Agreement (the " _Contribution and Distribution
Agreement_ ") pursuant to which the Company shall distribute, transfer and/or
license the Company Selected Assets to the Seller (or one of its
Subsidiaries) and the Seller will contribute and transfer to the Company the
Seller Selected Assets (the " _Contribution and Distribution Transaction_ ")
prior to the Closing; **** and

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , Buyer, through itself or one or more of its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries, desires to purchase and assume from Seller or one or more of
its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, and Seller, through itself or one or
more of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, desires to sell, transfer and
assign to Buyer or one of more of its Subsidiaries, the assets described on
_Exhibit C_ (the " _Purchased Assets_ ") and the liabilities described on
_Exhibit D_ (the " _Assumed Liabilities_ ") upon the terms and subject to
the conditions specified in this Agreement (the " _Asset Purchase_ ").

  



  

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows:

  



  

 **ARTICLE I**

  



  

 **PURCHASE**

  



  

Section 1.01 _Stock Purchase_.

  



  

(a) _General_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
the Buyer agrees to purchase from the Seller, and the Seller agrees to sell
to the Buyer, the Shares, which Shares collectively constitute and shall
constitute as of the Closing Date all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company, for the Purchase Price as specified in Section
1.01(b).

        
   

  



  

(b) _Purchase Price_. The combined purchase prices for the Shares (the "
_Stock Purchase Price_ ") and the Purchased Assets (the " _Asset Purchase
Price_ " and together with the Stock Purchase Price, the " _Purchase Price_
"), subject to the assumption by the Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities, shall
be Two Hundred Twenty-Nine Million Dollars ($229,000,000), subject
to adjustment as set forth in this Article I.  The Purchase Price shall be
paid by the Buyer to the Seller at the Closing in cash by delivery to the
Seller of immediately available funds. The Parties agree that the allocation
of the Purchase Price between the Stock Purchase Price and the Asset Purchase
Price shall be determined using the procedures specified in Section
6.02(h)(iii). The Asset Purchase Price shall be paid by the Buyer (as agent
for each Subsidiary of the Buyer party to a Business Transfer Agreement) to
the Seller (as agent for each Subsidiary of the Seller party to a Business
Transfer Agreement) at the Closing in cash by delivery to the Seller of
immediately available funds.

  



  

(c) _Flow of Funds_. At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, the
Parties shall agree upon a flow of funds memorandum setting forth all
payments required to be made by or on behalf of all Parties at the Closing,
including for each such payment identification of the payor, the payee, the
amount and the wire transfer information.

  



  

Section 1.02 _Asset Purchase_. The Purchased Assets shall be sold,
conveyed, transferred, assigned and delivered, and the Assumed Liabilities
shall be assumed, pursuant to (i) a business transfer agreement for each non-
United States jurisdiction in which Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities
are located, based substantially on the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
E,_ with only such deviations therefrom as are required by Applicable Law
(the " _Business Transfer Agreements_ "), and (ii) such other agreements as
may reasonably be required to effect the sale, conveyance, transfer,
assignment and delivery of the Purchased Assets and assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities, which shall be executed no later than at or as of the Closing by
one or more of the Sellers Subsidiaries, as appropriate, and the Buyer or
one of its Subsidiaries (documents identified in item (ii), together with the
Business Transfer Agreements, are sometimes hereinafter referred to
collectively as the " _Asset Purchase Documents_ "). Such sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance and delivery of the Purchased Assets and such assumption
of the Assumed Liabilities will be subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Asset Purchase Documents.

  



  

Section 1.03 _Escrow_. On the Closing Date and immediately before the
Closing, the Seller, the Buyer and Branch Banking and Trust Company (the "
_Escrow Agent_ ") shall enter into an Escrow Agreement in the form attached
hereto as  _Exhibit F_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). On the Closing Date and
immediately before the Closing, the Buyer shall withhold Twenty-Two Million
Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($22,900,000) (the " _Escrow Deposit_ ") from
the Stock Purchase Price and deposit such amount into escrow pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

Section 1.04 _The Contribution and Distribution Transaction_. Simultaneously
with the execution of this Agreement, the Seller and the Company shall enter
into the Contribution and Distribution Agreement and, provided that all
conditions precedent to the Contribution and Distribution Transaction set
forth in the Contribution and Distribution Agreement have been satisfied or
waived, the Seller and the Company shall consummate, or cause to be
consummated, the Contribution and Distribution Transaction prior to the
Closing.  In connection with the

  



        
   

  



  

consummation of the Contribution and Distribution Transaction, the Seller and
the Company shall enter into a license agreement in substantially the form
attached to the Contribution and Distribution Agreement as Exhibit C thereto
(the " _License Agreement_ "), pursuant to which the Company shall license
certain Intellectual Property to the Seller on the terms and conditions set
forth in the License Agreement.

  



  

Section 1.05 _Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to the Seller a pro forma balance sheet of the Company together
with a statement of the Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Statement of
Closing Net Working Capital_ ") and a copy of all work papers relating to the
preparation of the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital.  The Statement
of Closing Net Working Capital shall be based upon the books and records of
the Company and the books and records relating to the Purchased Assets and
Assumed Liabilities and shall be prepared in accordance with Modified GAAP.
The Seller, and any accountants or advisors retained by the Seller, shall be
permitted access to the books and records of the Company and to the personnel
familiar with the preparation of the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital
for the purposes of reviewing the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital.

  



  

(b) The Statement of Closing Net Working Capital shall be final and binding
on the Parties unless the Seller shall, within thirty (30) days after the
delivery of the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital, deliver to the
Buyer written notice of any disagreement with the Statement of Closing Net
Working Capital, which notice shall describe the nature of any such
disagreement. If the Seller raises any objections within the aforesaid thirty
(30) day period, then the Seller and the Buyer shall in good faith attempt to
resolve the disputed matter. If the Seller and the Buyer are unable
to resolve all disagreements within thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Buyer of a written notice of disagreement, then, within ten (10) days
thereafter, the Seller and the Buyer shall jointly select an arbiter from a
nationally recognized independent public accounting firm that is not the
independent auditor of any of the Buyer or the Company or their Affiliates or
any firm that has provided services to the Buyer, the Seller or the Company
since December 31, 2007 (or such other arbiter as the parties shall mutually
select). If the Buyer and the Seller are unable to select an arbiter within
such time period, the American Arbitration Association shall make such
selection (the Person so selected shall be referred to herein as the "
_Accounting Arbitrator_ ").

  



  

(c) The Accounting Arbitrator shall consider only those matters set forth in
the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital upon which the Buyer and the
Seller have disagreed and shall be required to resolve the matters in
accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. In submitting a
dispute to the Accounting Arbitrator, each of the Buyer and the Seller shall
concurrently furnish, at its own expense, to the Accounting Arbitrator and
the other Party such documents and information as the Accounting Arbitrator
may request. Each of the Buyer and the Seller may also furnish to the
Accounting Arbitrator such other information and documents as it deems
relevant, with copies of such submission and all such documents and
information being concurrently given to the other Party. Neither the Buyer
nor the Seller shall have or conduct any communication with the Accounting
Arbitrator without the other Partys either being present or receiving a
concurrent copy of any written or email communication. The Accounting
Arbitrator may conduct a conference concerning the objections

  



        
   

  



  

of, and disagreements between, the Seller and the Buyer, at which conference
each Party shall have the right to (i) present its documents, materials and
other evidence (previously provided to the Accounting Arbitrator and the
other Party), and (ii) have present its advisors, accountants, counsel and
other representatives.

  



  

(d) The Accounting Arbitrator shall resolve each item of disagreement based
solely on the presentations and supporting material provided by the Parties
and not pursuant to any independent review (the foregoing, however, shall not
preclude the Accounting Arbitrator from independent research of facts or
determining proper application of Modified GAAP or the terms of this
Agreement with respect to the subject matter of the objections and
disagreement between the Parties). The Parties will instruct the
Accounting Arbitrator to issue a detailed written report within thirty (30)
days after the selection of the Accounting Arbitrator that sets forth the
resolution of all items in dispute and that contains a final Statement of
Closing Net Working Capital. Such report shall be final and binding upon the
Parties. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator incurred in
connection with the determination of the disputed items by the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be borne by the Seller and the Buyer in an amount
proportionate to the dollar amount contested and not awarded to such Party as
a percentage of the total dollar amount contested by the Parties, as
determined by the Accounting Arbitrator. The Buyer, the Company and the
Seller shall cooperate fully with the Accounting Arbitrator and respond on a
timely basis to all requests for information or access to documents
or personnel made by the Accounting Arbitrator or by other Parties hereto,
all with the intent to fairly and in good faith resolve all disputes relating
to the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital as promptly as
reasonably practicable.

  



  

(e) If the amount representing Closing Net Working Capital (calculated in
a manner consistent with prior practice before June 27, 2010 and
in accordance with this Section 1.05(e)) as reflected in the Statement
of Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined in accordance with
this Section 1.05 is less than the Target Closing Net Working Capital by
more than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), the Purchase Price shall
be decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such shortfall
(but only to the extent that such shortfall exceeds Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($500,000)). If the amount representing Closing Net Working Capital
(calculated in a manner consistent with prior practice before June 27, 2010
and in accordance with this Section 1.05(e)) as reflected in the Statement of
Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined in accordance with this
Section 1.05 is greater than the Target Closing Net Working Capital by more
than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), the Purchase Price shall be
increased by the sum of (i) One Dollar ($1.00) for each dollar of Closing Net
Working Capital in excess of Thirty-Two Million Seven Hundred Seventy-Six
Thousand Dollars ($32,776,000) up to and including Thirty-Three Million One
Hundred Twenty-Seven Thousand Dollars ($33,127,000), and (ii) by Fifty Cents
($0.50) for each dollar of Closing Net Working Capital in excess of Thirty-
Three Million One Hundred Twenty-Seven Thousand Dollars ($33,127,000).
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that if the amount
of Closing Backlog is materially lower than $30,900,000, then the Parties
will negotiate in good faith regarding an equitable adjustment to the
Purchase Price adjustment contemplated by this Section 1.05.

  



  

(f) If any adjustment pursuant to this Section 1.05 results in an aggregate
increase in the Purchase Price, within five (5) Business Days after the
final determination of the

  



        
   

  



  

Closing Net Working Capital, the Buyer shall remit to the Seller in
immediately available funds the amount of such increase. Conversely, if any
adjustment pursuant to this Section 1.05 results in an aggregate reduction in
the Purchase Price, within five (5) Business Days after the final
determination of the Closing Net Working Capital, the Seller and the Buyer
shall send joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent, instructing the
Escrow Agent to distribute to the Buyer in immediately available funds the
amount of such reduction from the Escrow Deposit.

respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Body, other than (i) compliance
with any requirements of the HSR Act and any Foreign Antitrust Laws, (ii)

all material respects. No event has occurred that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of
the Buyer or the Buyer Debt Provider under any term or condition of the Debt
Provider Letter. The Buyer has no reason to believe that it will be unable to
satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Closing to be
satisfied by the Buyer contained in the Debt Provider Letter. The Debt

Provider Letter and taken all other actions required to be taken by it

Purchased Assets. Immediately following the Closing and after giving effect

of matters relating to the completion of the Transactions and work
cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required approvals or consents
of any Governmental Body (whether domestic, foreign or supranational). In
that regard, each Party shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and
subject to all applicable privileges, including the attorney-client
privilege, without limitation: (i) promptly notify the other Party of, and if

and reasonable assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of
information to any such Governmental Body.

agreement with, or rules and regulations of, a securities exchange.

  



  

Section 5.04 _Access_. The Company shall permit representatives of the Buyer
(including legal counsel and accountants) to have, upon prior written notice,
reasonable access during normal business hours and under
reasonable circumstances, and in a manner so as not to interfere with the
normal business operations of the Company, to the premises, personnel, books,
records (including Tax records), Contracts, and documents of or solely
pertaining to the Company. Neither the Buyer nor any of its respective
representatives shall contact any employee, customer, supplier or landlord of
the Company without the prior written consent of the Executive Vice President
and General Manager of the Company. The Buyer shall retain for a
reasonable period after the Closing Date (and at least as long as is
consistent with the Buyers record-retention policies and practices), those
books, records (including Tax records), Contracts and documents of or
pertaining to the Company, and shall provide the Seller and its
representatives reasonable access thereto, during normal business hours and
on prior notice, for reasonable business purposes and for the purpose of
historical research and publication of historical materials relating to the
Company.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 5.05 _Confidentiality_. The Buyer shall comply with, and shall
cause its representatives to comply with, all of its and their obligations
under the confidentiality agreement, dated as of May 6, 2010 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between the Seller and the Buyer with respect
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transactions and the
Company information disclosed pursuant to Section 5.04 or otherwise, which
agreement will remain in full force and effect until the Closing Date, and
shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.06 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) The Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy all
conditions applicable to the Buyer in the Debt Provider Letter; and (ii)
consummate the Debt Funding at or prior to the Closing.  Immediately after
this Agreement is executed and delivered by the Parties, the Buyer shall
trigger the call provisions under the Debt Provider Letter, provide all
applicable notices thereunder and take any and all other actions required to
be taken by the Buyer thereunder to call the Buyer Debt Provider to
contribute the requisite amount of its commitment to the Buyer sufficient
(when taken together with other sources of funds immediately available to the
Buyer) to enable the Buyer to pay the Purchase Price and any and all
Transaction Expenses payable by the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents.

  



  

(b) In the event that any portion of the Debt Funding becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Provider Letter, the Buyer
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any such unavailable portion
from alternative sources on comparable or more favorable terms to the Buyer
(as determined in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Buyer) as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event.  The Buyer
shall promptly provide the Seller with the documentation evidencing such
alternative sources of financing and shall give the Seller prompt notice (but
in any event within two (2) Business Days) of any material breach by any
party to the Debt Provider Letter or any termination of the Debt Provider
Letter. The Buyer shall keep the Seller informed on a reasonably current
basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange for
replacement financing, if necessary, and shall not permit any material
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material
provision or remedy under, the Debt Provider Letter (or any replacement
thereof) without first consulting with the Seller or, if such amendment or
modification would or would be reasonably expected to prevent, delay or
hinder the Buyers ability to consummate the Transactions, without first
obtaining the Sellers prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld).

  



  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, if the Buyer fails to obtain the Debt Funding
contemplated by the Debt Provider Letter, or any alternative financing, the
Buyer shall continue to be obligated to perform its obligations under this
Agreement, including this Section 5.06, and to consummate the Stock Purchase,
the Asset Purchase and the other Transactions on the terms contemplated
hereby (subject only to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Sections 7.01 and 7.02, as applicable).  The Parties hereby agree and
acknowledge that, with respect to the Buyers obligations pursuant to this
Section 5.06, time is of the essence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, there shall be no cure period for any breach by the Buyer
of this Section 5.06.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 5.07 _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

  



  

(a) The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it has made its own inquiry and
investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning, the Seller and the Company and their businesses and operations,
and the Buyer has requested such documents and information from the Seller
and the Company as it considers material in determining whether to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that it has had an opportunity to ask all questions of and receive
answers from the Seller and the Company in determining whether to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. In connection with such
investigation, the Buyer and its representatives have received from the
Seller, the Company or their respective representatives certain other
estimates, projections and other forecasts for the Seller and the Company and
certain estimates, plans and budget information.

  



  

(b) The Buyer agrees that, except for the representations and warranties made
by the Company that are expressly set forth in Article III of this Agreement
(as modified by the Company Disclosure Schedules) and in any certificate
provided pursuant to Sections 7.02(a) and 7.02(b), neither the Seller nor the
Company nor any other Person makes, or shall be deemed to have made, any
representation or warranty, express or implied, of any kind, including any
representation or warranty as to merchantability, habitability, workmanship,
profitability, future performance, fitness for a particular purpose or non-
infringement, whether or not contained in any document or other communication
provided or otherwise made available to the Buyer or any Person acting on
behalf of the Buyer during the course of due diligence or otherwise
(including in any management presentation, information or offering
memorandum, supplemental information, data room, estimate, projection,
forecast, plan, budget or other forward-looking information or other
materials or information with respect to any of the above).

  



  

Section 5.08 _Certain Company Accruals_. The Seller shall take or cause to be
taken all actions necessary for it to assume all accruals on the books and
records of the Company in respect of certain obligations of the Company
and/or the Seller listed on Schedule 5.08 of the Company Disclosure Schedules
and shall pay (i) the bonus compensation and profit sharing liabilities set
forth therein (which amounts shall be prorated for the partial year ended on
the Closing Date and shall expressly exclude any accrued sales commissions)
within thirty (30) days after the Closing and (ii) the transaction incentive
payments and severance payments set forth therein within thirty (30) days
after the Closing or at such later date as is contemplated by the applicable
agreement governing any such payments.

  



  

Section 5.09 _Transition Services_. During the period commencing on the date
hereof and ending three (3) days prior to the Closing Date, the Parties
may mutually agree in writing to modify the transition services described
on Schedule A attached to the Transition Services Agreement on terms and
conditions mutually agreeable to the Parties.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Third Party Consents_. The Seller and the Company shall use
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective
commercially reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain, and deliver to the
Buyer, the third party consents set forth on Schedule 3.03 of the Company
Disclosure Schedules prior to the Closing. To the extent the same, in whole
or in part, are not so obtained, such efforts shall continue for a period of
six months after the

  



        
   

  



  

Closing and the parties shall cooperate with each other in any reasonable
arrangement to provide that the Company shall receive all of the benefits
(and bear all of the obligations) of the Seller (or the applicable Affiliate
of the Seller) in, to or under any of the agreements set forth on Schedule
3.03.

  



  

 **ARTICLE VI**

  



  

 **POST-CLOSING COVENANTS**

  



  

Section 6.01 _General_. In case at any time after the Closing any further
action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each Party
shall take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such
further instruments and documents) as the other Party reasonably may request,
all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party.

  



  

Section 6.02 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) For the period from the Closing Date through the first (1st) anniversary
thereof, the Buyer agrees to provide, or cause the Company to provide, each
employee of the Company (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") with (i)
compensation (including salary, wages, and historical bonus potential but
excluding any equity-based compensation, transaction, severance or change of
control bonuses or payments) that is no less favorable in the aggregate than
the compensation provided by the Company immediately prior to the Closing;
and (ii) employee benefits plans, programs and arrangements that in all
material respects are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee
benefits as in effect for other employees of the Buyer and its Affiliates
immediately prior to the Closing (collectively, " _Comparable Compensation
and Benefits_ ").

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to each benefit plan,
program, practice, policy or arrangement (including the Buyers severance
plans, policies, or arrangements, and paid time off, vacation, and sick leave
policies), maintained by the Buyer or the Company and in which any of the
Company Employees become eligible to participate (the " _Buyer Plans_ "), for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit
accrual **,** employment service with the Company (or predecessor employers
to the extent the Company provides past service credit) shall be treated as
employment service with the Buyer and/or any of its applicable Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such prior employment service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits. Such credit for prior employment service also shall apply for
purposes of satisfying any waiting periods or evidence of insurability
requirements applicable under any of the Buyer Plans. The Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of the applicable Buyer Plans
to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Company
Employees and their eligible dependents under the Buyer Plans, except to the
extent that such limitations, evidence of insurability and waiting periods
were applicable to such individuals under a comparable Employee Benefit Plan,
and (ii) give Company Employees and their eligible dependents credit under
the Buyer Plans for amounts paid during the year in which the Closing occurs
under a corresponding Employee Benefit Plan for purposes of

  



        
   

  



  

satisfying any applicable deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums
as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Buyer Plans.

  



  

(c) The Buyer shall cause the applicable Buyer Plan to accept eligible
rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code and
inclusive of any outstanding participant loans) from Company Employees with
respect to any account balances distributed on or as of the Closing Date by
the applicable Employee Benefit Plan. The distributions and rollovers
described herein shall comply with Applicable Law; and each Party shall make
all filings and take any actions required of such Party under Applicable Law
in connection therewith.

  



  

(d) The Buyer shall assume and honor all balances under the Companys
vacation, paid time off, and sick leave policies accrued by Company Employees
as of the Closing Date to the extent set forth in the Statement of Closing
Net Working Capital as finally determined in accordance with Section 1.05.

  



  

(e) With respect to matters relating to the Non-Company Employees, the Seller
and the Buyer agree to the procedures, terms and conditions set forth in
_Exhibit G_.

  



  

(f) The Parties acknowledge that the lists of employees on Schedules
10.01(a), 10.01(d), 10.01(e) and G.6 are complete and accurate to the
knowledge of each Party as of the date of this Agreement, but remain subject
to review and correction.  The Parties shall cooperate to review and, if
required, correct each such Schedule within ten (10) days after the date of
this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.03 _Tax Matters_ **.**

  



  

(a) _Post-Closing Tax Return Filings_.

  



  

(i) The Seller shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and
timely filed) with the appropriate Taxing Authorities all income Tax Returns
for the Company for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date
(each, a " _Seller Return_ "). The Seller will include the Company in
a federal consolidated income tax return of the affiliated group of which
Seller is the common parent for the taxable year of the Company that includes
the Closing Date. If necessary to permit the Seller to properly file any
Seller Return, the Buyer shall cause each Seller Return to be executed by an
authorized Person on behalf of the Company. The Buyer shall prepare
and timely file (or cause to be prepared and timely filed) with the
appropriate Taxing Authorities all Tax Returns (other than Seller Returns)
required to be filed by the Company with respect to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date that are due after the Closing Date (each a
" _Buyer Return_ "). The Buyer (or the Company) shall timely pay the Tax
shown as due on each such Tax Return (other than Seller Returns that are
Group Returns), and shall be entitled to indemnification in respect of
such Tax to the extent provided by Section 9.01. Each such Tax Return shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with the prior practice of the Company
unless otherwise required by Applicable Law or specified in Schedule
6.03(a)(i). The Buyer shall make such revisions to Buyer Returns as are
reasonably requested by the Seller within fifteen (15) days after receipt by
the Seller of each Buyer Return for review pursuant to Section 6.03(a)(ii).

  



        
   

  



  

(ii) The Buyer shall provide the Seller with a copy of each Buyer Return that
the Buyer proposes to file for review and approval at least thirty (30) days
before the filing of such return (or, if required to be filed within thirty
(30) days after the Closing Date or the end of the taxable period to which
such return relates, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing
or end of such taxable period, as the case may be), accompanied by a
statement (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Statement_ ") setting forth and calculating
in reasonable detail the Pre-Closing Taxes (as defined below) and Indemnified
Taxes that are shown as due on such Tax Return. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Indemnified Taxes_ " means the excess of the Pre-Closing Taxes
over the amount of such Pre-Closing Taxes that was taken into account
in computing the Closing Net Working Capital.  Failure to file a Tax Return
that would be a Buyer Tax Return shall not limit the Sellers indemnification
obligation for Indemnified Taxes under Section 9.01 in any case that such
non-filing is consistent with the prior practice of the Company in respect of
the similar Tax Return in the immediately preceding taxable period.

  



  

(iii) If the Seller disagrees with the manner of preparation of a Buyer
Return or the amount of Pre-Closing Taxes or Indemnified Taxes calculated in
a Pre-Closing Tax Statement with respect to such Buyer Return, within thirty
(30) days after receipt of such Buyer Return and Pre-Closing Tax Statement
the Seller shall provide to the Buyer a notice of such dispute (a " _Tax
Statement Dispute_ "). If the Seller does not provide a notice of Tax
Statement Dispute within such thirty-day period, the Seller shall be
deemed to have accepted the Buyer Tax Return and Pre-Closing Tax Statement
relating thereto for purposes of Article IX.  If the Seller provides the
Buyer with a notice of a Tax Statement Dispute, the Seller shall also provide
the Buyer with a written explanation of the reasons for its disagreement with
such Buyer Return and/or Pre-Closing Tax Statement. The Buyer and the
Seller shall attempt to resolve their disagreement within the fifteen (15)
days following the Sellers notification to the Buyer of a Tax
Statement Dispute. If the Seller and the Buyer cannot reach complete
agreement within fifteen (15) days, they each shall select a Tax expert from
an accounting firm or law firm knowledgeable in the area of the dispute, and
such experts shall attempt to resolve the differences. Each Party shall
be responsible for the costs and fees of its Tax expert. If the Buyer and the
Seller are unable to resolve their disagreement through their respective Tax
experts, the dispute shall be submitted to an arbitrator (the " _Tax
Arbitrator_ ") pursuant to the procedures described in Section 1.05(b) with
respect to the Accounting Arbitrator, for resolution within fifteen (15) days
of such submission. The decision of the Tax Arbitrator with respect to such
dispute shall be binding upon the Parties.

  



  

(iv) Each Pre-Closing Tax Statement with respect to a Buyer Return shall be
treated as the notice required by Section 9.04(a) in respect of any claim
for indemnity by any Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of the Indemnified
Taxes shown thereon with respect to a Buyer Return.  Any Loss attributable
to Indemnified Taxes shall be determined by reference to actual losses or
expenses of the Buyer Indemnified Parties in the same manner as other Losses
pursuant to Article IX, and, for instance, shall be reduced by any Tax
benefit that is correlative to the incurring of or payment of such
Indemnified Taxes. The amount of the Loss attributable to Indemnified Taxes
shown in any Pre-Closing Tax Statement as finally determined pursuant to the
preceding paragraph shall be treated as a "Loss" that is indemnifiable
pursuant to Section 9.01. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Pre-Closing
Taxes_ " means all Taxes attributable to taxable periods (or the portion
thereof) of the Company, the Seller and the Sellers Subsidiaries ending on
or before the Closing Date, all Taxes attributable to the Section

  



        
   

  



  

338(h)(10) Election, all Taxes attributable to the transactions described in
Sections 1.02 and 1.04 hereof, other than (x) Taxes that are Transaction
Expenses required to be borne by the Buyer pursuant to Section 11.01, and (y)
Taxes incurred by the Company other than in the ordinary course of business
or contemplated by this Agreement, that are attributable to the acts or
omissions of the Buyer or the Buyers Affiliates occurring after the Closing
time on the Closing Date.

  



  

(v) The provisions of any Tax sharing agreement under which the Company may
incur liability to the Seller or any of its Affiliates shall be terminated on
or before the Closing Date in respect of any taxable period or portion
thereof of the Company beginning after the Closing Date, and any liability of
the Company to the Seller or any of its Affiliates under any such Tax sharing
agreement shall be discharged or released on or before the Closing Date, so
that the Company shall neither have nor thereafter incur any liability to
Seller or any of its Affiliates thereunder.

  



  

(b) _Taxable Year Closing; Allocation of Taxes_. The Buyer and the Seller
shall, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, treat the taxable periods
of the Company as ending as of the close of business on the Closing Date. The
Buyer shall not permit the Company to take any action after the Closing
time on the Closing Date that is out of the Ordinary Course of Business,
except as required by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes
incurred by the Company with respect to a taxable period that includes but
does not end on the Closing Date shall be allocated to the portion of the
period ending on the Closing Date: (i) except as provided in (ii) and (iii)
below, such as sales tax, to the extent feasible, on a specific
identification basis, according to the date of the event or transaction
giving rise to the Tax, and (ii) except as provided in (iii) below, with
respect to periodically assessed ad valorem Taxes and Taxes not otherwise
reasonably allocable to specific transactions or events, in proportion to the
number of days in such period occurring through the Closing Date compared to
the total number of days in such period, and (iii) in the case of any Tax
based upon or related to income or receipts, in an amount equal to the Tax
that would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing
Date including taxable periods of any flow-though entities in which
Company holds any equity interest. Any credits relating to a taxable period
that begins before and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken into
account as though the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date.
All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations
shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practices of the Company. For
avoidance of doubt, for all income tax purposes, all deductions arising under
section 83(h) of the Code as a result of exercises or settlement of options
by Company Employees against stock of the Seller after the Closing Date shall
reported by the Parties as expenses of the Seller as successor to the Company
pursuant to Section 381 of the Code, and neither Buyer nor the Company shall
take any Tax reporting position inconsistent with such treatment by the
Seller.

  



  

(c) _Tax Elections; Amended Returns_. Except in connection with a
Proceeding resolved pursuant to Section 6.03(e) (including
consistent correlative adjustments to Tax Returns for non-audited taxable
periods), no Party or Affiliate of a Party may amend or cause the amendment
of a Tax Return of the Company, or file or amend any Tax election, or file a
Tax Return after the due date thereof, concerning the Company, in each case,
with respect to any taxable period that would affect the computation of Pre-
Closing Taxes, without the written consent of the Seller, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Buyer

  



         
 

  



  

shall, upon request by the Seller, cooperate in the preparation of and
submission to the proper Taxing Authority of any amended Tax Return with
respect to the Company for any taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date that is necessary to cause such Tax Return to be consistent
with adjustments to a Tax Return for any other taxable period proposed by a
Taxing Authority or correlative to adjustments of items included in the
consolidated federal income Tax Return of the Seller or Tax Returns of its
other Affiliates, or that is otherwise required by Applicable Law to be
filed.

  



  

(d) _Overpayments and Overaccruals of Certain Taxes_. If, as the result of an
audit or examination, a claim for refund, the filing of an amended Tax Return
or other determination, other than amounts attributable to any carryback of
Tax attributes of the Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company) arising
in a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date
(but subject to prior consent of Seller pursuant to Section 6.03(c) to the
filing of such carryback claim), there has been an overpayment with respect
to Taxes of the Company for taxable periods or a portion thereof ending on
the Closing Date that would be Indemnified Taxes if unpaid as of the Closing
Date, Taxes paid pursuant to a claim for indemnification under Section 9.01,
or an overaccrual of Taxes that were reflected as a liability in the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, the Buyer shall promptly pay an
amount equal to such overpayment or overaccrual, and the interest actually
received thereon, to the Seller upon receipt by (or crediting for the benefit
of) the Buyer or its Affiliates or reversal of the overaccrual on the
financial statements of the Buyer or the Company, unless and to the extent
that the entitlement to any refund or credit of such overpayment was taken
into account in computing the amount of indemnified Loss in respect of such
Taxes or reflected in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer shall not offset any Tax refunds payable to
the Seller hereunder against any indemnifiable Losses except with the prior
written consent of the Seller.

  



  

(e) _Audits and Contests Regarding Taxes_. Any Party who receives, or whose
Affiliate receives, any notice of a pending or Threatened Tax audit,
assessment or adjustment or other Proceeding related to Taxes against or with
respect to the Company that may give rise to a right to indemnification from
the Escrow Deposit pursuant to the terms of Article IX shall promptly notify
the Seller within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such notice. The Buyer
and the Seller each agree to consult with and to keep the other informed on a
regular basis regarding the status of any Tax Proceeding to the extent that
such Proceeding could affect a liability of any of the Parties (including
indemnity obligations hereunder). The Seller shall have the right to
represent the Companys interests in any Tax Proceeding pertaining
to Indemnified Taxes or Taxes of the Seller and to employ counsel of its
choice at the Sellers expense in such Proceeding, and to control the
disposition of any issue involved in such Proceeding; provided that, except
in the case of a Proceeding relating to a Group Return in which the Company
was included for any period through the Closing Date, the Buyer shall have
the right to participate in such Proceeding at its own expense, and shall be
entitled to control the disposition of any issue involved in such Proceeding
that reasonably would not be expected to affect either Indemnified Taxes or
Taxes of the Seller. Both the Buyer and the Seller shall be entitled to
represent their own interests in light of their responsibilities (including
indemnity obligations) for related Taxes, at their own expense, in any Tax
Proceeding involving a taxable period of the Company that includes but does
not end on the Closing Date or involving both a taxable period of the Company
ending on or before the Closing Date and a taxable period ending after the
Closing Date, and no

  



        
   

  



  

such Proceeding may be settled or compromised by the Seller or the Buyer
without the consent of both the Seller and the Buyer, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section
6.03(e), the provisions of Article IX, including the provisions therein
addressing settlement authority, shall govern the manner in which Tax
Proceedings are conducted.

  



  

(f) _Cooperation, Access to Information and Records Retention_. The Seller
and the Buyer shall cooperate as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns as
provided herein and any Proceeding with respect to Taxes relating to the
Company.  Such cooperation shall include the provision of records and
information reasonably relevant to any Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
 The Buyer agrees (i) to retain all books and records relevant to Taxes of
the Company (including Tax Returns (other than income Tax Returns, which
shall be retained by the Seller)) relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
for assessment of Taxes for such respective taxable period, and (ii) to give
the Seller reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the Seller so requests, the
Buyer shall allow the Seller to take possession of or copy such books and
records.

  



  

(g) _Tax Certificates_. The Buyer and the Seller agree, upon request of the
other, to use all reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Body as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce
or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the
Transactions).

  



  

(h) _Section 338(h)(10) Election; Purchase Price Allocation_.

  



  

(i) The Seller and the Buyer agree they shall make a joint election under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any similar elections permitted by
applicable state or local Tax law) (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10)
Elections_ ") with respect to sale and purchase of the Shares under this
Agreement. The Buyer shall provide a properly completed Form 8023 (previously
executed on behalf of the Buyer) to Seller before the Closing, and the Seller
shall execute and deliver to the Buyer on the Closing Date such Form 8023 and
any other such documents that are or have been provided by the Buyer for
execution at the Closing that are required to make effective the Section
338(h)(10) Elections. Each Party shall promptly execute such other forms as
may be reasonably requested by the other in connection with making or
perfecting the Section 338(h)(10) Elections. The Buyer shall be responsible
for the preparation and filing of all forms and documents required to make
the Section 338(h)(10) Elections.  The Parties shall cooperate fully with
each other and make available to each other such Tax data and other
information as may be reasonably required by the Buyer or the Seller in order
to timely file the Section 338(h)(10) Elections. The Parties shall take
a consistent position for all relevant Tax purposes that the Parties
election under Section 338(h)(10) and any similar elections under state and
local law were validly made and fully effective.

  



  

(ii) In connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Elections and the Asset
Purchase, the Parties agree that the Purchase Price and other items properly
includible in the deemed sales price of the assets of the Company pursuant to
the Section 338(h)(10) Elections 

  



        
   

  



  

and Asset Purchase (the " _Tax Consideration_ ") shall be allocated for Tax
purposes among the Companys assets in a manner consistent with the
provisions of Section 338 and Section 1060 of the Code and all regulations
promulgated thereunder.  The Tax Consideration shall be allocated among the
Companys assets and the Purchased Assets in a manner consistent with the
fair market values of such assets as are agreed between the Parties or
determined pursuant to Section 6.03(h)(iii). _Appendix B_ (the "
_Value Schedule_ ") sets forth the amounts that the Parties agree as of the
Closing Date are the fair market values of specific assets or groups of
assets listed thereon (if any).

  



  

(iii) The Buyer shall deliver to the Seller, along with the Statement of
Closing Net Working Capital pursuant to Section 1.05(a), a statement
containing the Buyers proposed allocation of the Tax Consideration among the
Companys assets and the Purchased Assets (the " _Allocation Statement_ "),
and draft IRS Forms 8883 and 8594 as proposed to be included by the Buyer
with its Tax Return for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date.
 The Allocation Statement shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
Value Schedule. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Allocation
Statement, the Seller shall review and comment on the Allocation Statement,
and provide to the Buyer draft IRS Forms 8883 and 8594 proposed to be
included by the Seller in its Tax Return for the taxable year in which the
Closing occurs.  Any dispute regarding the Allocation Statement or manner of
completing the Parties respective Forms 8883 and 8594 shall be resolved by
an independent accounting firm selected under procedures similar to those
specified in Section 1.05.

  



  

(iv) The Parties agree (A) to be bound by the Allocation Statement as finally
agreed between the Parties or as determined by an independent accounting firm
pursuant to Section 6.03(h)(iii), (B) to act in a manner consistent with the
Allocation Statement in the preparation and filing of income Tax Returns
(including filing their respective Forms 8883 and 8894 and any amended
thereto), (C) to provide a copy of any amendment or supplement to its Form
8883 or 8894 to the other as promptly as practicable after such amendment or
supplement is filed with the IRS and (D) in the course of any Proceeding
concerning Taxes, to take no position and cause their Affiliates to take no
position inconsistent with the Allocation Statement; provided, however, that
if in any audit of any Tax Return of any Party by a Taxing Authority the
allocation of the Tax Consideration is finally determined by a Taxing
Authority to be different from the Allocation Statement, then each Party may
(but shall not be required to) take any position or action consistent with
the allocation of the Tax Consideration as finally determined in such
Proceeding. In the event that any Taxing Authority disputes the allocation of
the Tax Consideration as reflected by any of the Parties on their respective
Tax Returns, such Party shall promptly notify the other Parties of the nature
of such dispute.

  



  

Section 6.04 _Name Change_. The Buyer shall cause the Company to make
all filings, take all other actions, and provide all notices necessary to
(i) change the Companys corporate name upon the Closing to a name that does
not include the word "Veeco" or any variation or simulation thereof, (ii)
promptly adopt new trade names, trademarks and servicemarks that do not
include the word "Veeco" or any variation or simulation thereof; (iii)
promptly cause all registrations relating to Company Registered Intellectual
Property, Owned Real Property and other Company-owned assets to be amended to
reflect the new Company name, (iv) promptly cause all bank, brokerage, line
of credit, and other financial accounts to be updated to reflect the new
Company name, and (v) promptly cause all Encumbrances relating to the Company
to be

  



        
   

  



  

updated to reflect the new Company name. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Seller shall grant to the Company a non-exclusive, limited, paid-up license
to use the "Veeco" trademark during a transition period not to exceed six (6)
months solely for purposes of (A) selling any inventory of the Company that
contains, or is marked with, such trademarks and is existing as of the
Closing or (B) using and distributing any marketing materials of the Company
that contain, or are marked with, such trademarks and are existing as of the
Closing.

  



  

Section 6.05 _Covenant Not to Compete_. For a period of five (5) years from
and after the Closing Date, the Seller will not, directly or indirectly and
in any capacity of any nature whatsoever, engage in the business
of designing, manufacturing or selling atomic force microscopes, scanning
probe microscopes, stylus profilers or fast 3D optical microscopes used to
provide surface measurements in (a) research or (b) offline or quality
assurance (QA) production environments, in any geographic area in which the
Company conducts that business as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Seller may own less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding
stock of any company and shall not be deemed to engage solely by reason
thereof in any of its businesses; _provided_ , _further_ , that this section
shall not prevent the Seller from designing, manufacturing, using or selling
in-situ metrology equipment for use in process equipment systems or
incorporating third-party metrology equipment into Sellers process equipment
systems. In addition, (A) for a period of two (2) years from and after the
Closing Date, the Seller will not, directly or indirectly and in any capacity
of any nature whatsoever, solicit for employment, consulting or other similar
relationship any then current employees of the Company or any Non-Company
Employees hired by Buyer, or any persons who were employees of the Company at
any time within the immediately preceding six (6) months, and (B) for a
period of one (1) year from and after the Closing Date, the Seller will not,
directly or indirectly and in any capacity of any nature whatsoever, hire as
an employee, consultant or in a similar capacity any then current employee of
the Company or any Non-Company Employees hired by Buyer, or any persons who
were employees of the Company at any time within the immediately preceding
six (6) months; _provided, however_ , that the Seller and its Affiliates may
at any time make offers to and hire any employee or consultant who is not
selected by the Buyer to continue to provide services to the Company or an
Affiliate of the Company following the Closing or who is terminated by the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company following the Closing).
Furthermore, nothing in the immediately preceding sentence shall be construed
to prevent the Seller from hiring such employees or consultants resulting
from advertising of open positions, participating in job fairs or the like,
or other forms of soliciting candidates for employment or consulting services
which are general in nature.

 **ARTICLE IX**

  



  

 **INDEMNIFICATION**

  



  

Section 9.01 _Indemnification of the Buyer_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article IX, from and after the Closing, the Buyer and its
officers, directors, employees, Affiliates and agents (collectively, the "
_Buyer Indemnified Parties_ "), shall be entitled to indemnification for any
and all Losses arising out of (a) any inaccuracy of any representation or the
breach of any warranty made by the Company in Article III or in any Ancillary
Document; (b) any nonfulfillment by the Company before the Closing, or by the
Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller of any covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document that has not been cured within thirty
(30) days after receipt of written notice thereof by the Seller, and/or (c)
Indemnified Taxes (except as otherwise provided in Section 6.03(a)(ii)).
Except for claims based on the Sellers or the Companys fraud or
intentional misrepresentation or claims for Indemnified Taxes or claims based
on a breach of Section 3.18(e) or (f), indemnification under this Section
9.01 shall be limited to recovery from the Escrow Deposit.

  



  

Section 9.02 _Indemnification of the Seller_. From and after the Closing,
the Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold the Seller and its officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, Affiliates and agents (collectively, the
" _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from and against any and all
Losses arising out of (a) any inaccuracy of any representation or the breach
of any warranty made by the Buyer in Article IV or in any Ancillary Document
and/or (b) any nonfulfillment by the Company after the Closing, or by the
Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer of any covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or in any Ancillary Document that has not been cured within thirty
(30) days after receipt of written notice thereof by the Buyer.

  



  

Section 9.03 _Third Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) In the event that any Buyer Indemnified Party desires to make a claim
against the Escrow Deposit or any Seller Indemnified Party desires to make a
claim against the Buyer, in each case in connection with any Proceeding,
demand or other claim of a Third Party **** at any time instituted against
or made upon such Indemnified Party for which such Indemnified Party may
seek indemnification hereunder (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the applicable Indemnification
Control Person of such Third Party Claim and the Indemnified Partys claim
for indemnification with respect thereto.

  



  

(b) The Indemnification Control Person shall have the right to assume the
defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice by providing
written notice to the

  



        
   

  



  

Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the Indemnification Control
Person has received notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that, except as otherwise provided in respect of claims subject to Section
6.03(e), the Indemnified Party shall not be required to permit such an
assumption of the defense of any Third Party Claim that, if not first
paid, discharged or otherwise complied with, would reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Buyer or the Seller (as the case
may be).

  



  

(c) The assumption of the defense of any Third Party Claim by the
Indemnification Control Person shall not constitute an admission of
responsibility to indemnify the Indemnified Party or in any manner impair or
restrict the Indemnifying Partys rights to later be reimbursed its costs and
expenses if indemnification under this Agreement with respect to such
Proceeding, demand or other claim was not required. The Indemnification
Control Person shall not, in the defense of such claim, consent to the entry
of any judgment (other than a judgment of dismissal on the merits without
costs) or enter into any settlement without the written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned, except that no such consent shall be required if the sole
relief provided is monetary damages that are reimbursed to the Indemnified
Party in full as Losses (subject to, with respect to claims by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, the remaining Deductible Amount, if any, that will be
paid by the Buyer Indemnified Party, and subject to the other indemnification
limitations set forth in this Agreement).

  



  

(d) If the Indemnification Control Person assumes the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such claim, but solely by observation and comment to the
Indemnification Control Person, and any counsel selected by the Indemnified
Party shall not appear on its behalf in any Proceeding arising hereunder.
 The Indemnified Party shall bear the fees and expenses of any
additional counsel retained by it to participate in its defense.

  



  

(e) If the Indemnification Control Person does not assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim after receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim from the
Indemnified Party pursuant to Sections 9.03(a) and 9.03(b), the Indemnified
Party may defend against such claim in such manner as it reasonably
deems appropriate. The Indemnified Party may not settle such claim without
the written consent of the Indemnification Control Person, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  



  

(f) The Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties shall
cooperate in good faith and in all respects with the Indemnification Control
Person and its representatives (including its counsel) in the investigation,
negotiation, settlement, trial and/or defense of any Third Party Claim (and
any appeal arising therefrom). The Parties shall cooperate with each other
in any notifications to and information requests of any insurers. No
individual representative of any Indemnifying Party, or any Indemnifying
Partys Affiliates, shall be personally liable for any Loss or Losses under
this Agreement, except as specifically agreed to by said individual
representative.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 9.04 _Payment of Claims_.

  



  

(a) In the event that any Buyer Indemnified Party desires to seek
indemnification under this Article IX, the Buyer shall give reasonably prompt
written notice to the Seller specifying the facts constituting the basis for
such claim and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim asserted. If the
Seller disputes such claim for indemnification, it shall notify the Buyer
within thirty (30) days after its receipt of notice of such claim for
indemnification, whereupon the Buyer and the Seller shall meet and attempt in
good faith to resolve their differences with respect to such claim for
indemnification.  If the dispute has not been resolved within thirty (30)
days after such parties first met to attempt a resolution, either the Seller
or the Buyer may initiate litigation in accordance with Section 11.09. If the
Seller does not dispute such claim for indemnification, the Escrow Agent
shall, to the extent jointly requested by the Seller and the Buyer, pay the
Buyer Indemnified Party an amount in cash equal to the amount of such claim
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(b) In the event that any Seller Indemnified Party desires to seek
indemnification under this Article IX, the Seller shall give reasonably
prompt written notice to the Buyer specifying the facts constituting the
basis for such claim and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim
asserted. If the Buyer disputes such claim for indemnification, it shall
notify the Seller within thirty (30) days after its receipt of notice of such
claim for indemnification, whereupon the Buyer and the Seller shall meet and
attempt in good faith to resolve their differences with respect to such claim
for indemnification.  If the dispute has not been resolved within thirty (30)
days after such parties first met to attempt a resolution, either the Seller
or the Buyer may initiate litigation in accordance with Section 11.09. If the
Buyer does not dispute such claim for indemnification, the Buyer shall pay,
or shall cause the Company to pay, the Seller Indemnified Party an amount in
cash equal to the amount of such claim.

  



  

Section 9.05 _Limitations on Indemnification_. Except for claims based on
the Sellers or the Companys fraud or intentional misrepresentation, claims
for Indemnified Taxes, or claims based on a breach of Section 3.18(e) or (f),
no claim may be made against the Escrow Deposit unless and until the Buyer
Indemnified Parties have incurred aggregate Losses for which the Buyer
Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement in excess of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) in the aggregate (the
" _Deductible Amount_ ") and then only to the extent that such aggregate
amount of Losses exceeds the Deductible Amount. With respect to claims based
on a breach of Section 3.18(e) or (f), no claim may be made against the
Escrow Deposit or otherwise unless and until the Buyer Indemnified Parties
have incurred aggregate Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement in excess of Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) in the aggregate (the " _Environmental
Deductible Amount_ ") and then only to the extent that such aggregate amount
of Losses exceeds the Environmental Deductible Amount.  Notwithstanding any
other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, except for claims based on
the Sellers or the Companys fraud or intentional misrepresentation or
claims for Indemnified Taxes, the maximum aggregate indemnification to which
all the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled shall not exceed an amount
equal to the Escrow Deposit. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, if on the Closing Date any Buyer Indemnified
Party knows of any information that would cause one or more of the
representations or warranties in this Agreement to be inaccurate as of the
date made, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have no right or remedy after
the Closing with respect to such inaccuracy and shall be deemed to have
waived all rights to indemnification in respect thereof.

  



         
 

  



  

Section 9.06 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the case of actual fraud
or intentional misrepresentation by the Company or the Seller arising from
its representations and warranties contained in Article III of this
Agreement, the Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the indemnification set
forth in this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer
and its Affiliates for any and all Losses or any other liabilities sustained
or incurred by the Buyer or its Affiliates or their successors and assigns
in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents, the Stock
Purchase, the Asset Purchase or otherwise arising out of the Transactions;
and the Buyer hereby waives any other remedy that they, or any other Person
entitled to indemnification hereunder, may have hereunder, at law, in equity
or otherwise. Once any portion of the Escrow Deposit is released pursuant to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have
no further claim to such amounts. Except as provided in this Article IX, no
claim, action or remedy shall be brought or maintained by any
Buyer Indemnified Party against the Seller or its officers, directors,
employees, stockholders, Affiliates or agents, and no recourse shall be
brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any
alleged misstatement or omission respecting any inaccuracy in or breach of
any of the representations, warranties or covenants of any Party hereto set
forth or contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document.

  



  

Section 9.07 _Effect of Insurance, Taxes and Other Recoveries_.

  



  

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Article IX shall be reduced by (a) any amounts that may be recovered by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates from any Third Party, including,
without limitation, recovery of Losses covered by the Raytheon Indemnity or
Losses that otherwise arise from the legal obligations of the Raytheon
Company, (b) any insurance proceeds or other cash receipts or source of
reimbursement that may be received by the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates with respect to such Losses (each source named in clauses (a) and
(b), a " _Collateral Source_ ") and (c) the amount of any net Tax benefit, if
any, available to the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates attributable to

matter, which disclosure shall be effective for all purposes under this
Agreement, including to cure any misrepresentation or breach of warranty that
otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of such matter and for
purposes of Article IX; _provided_ that the disclosure provided in any such
amended, supplemented or revised schedule shall in no way be effective for
purposes of the conditions set forth in Article VII.

  



  

Section 11.05 _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. No Party may assign this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other Party.

Section 11.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause

Delaware.

  



  

Section 11.09 _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Except for disputes to
be resolved under Section 1.05(b) or Section 6.03(a)(iii), the Parties agree
that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the Transactions shall be brought in any federal court located in the State
of Delaware or any Delaware state court, and each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any Proceeding and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Proceeding in any such
court or that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Proceeding may be served on
any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or

  



        
   

  



  

without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each Party agrees that service of process on such Party as provided in
Section 11.07 shall be deemed effective service of process on such Party.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS.

  



  

Section 11.10 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of
this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by each of the Parties. No waiver by any Party of any provision of
this Agreement or any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or
covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be valid unless the
same shall be in writing and signed by the Party making such waiver, nor
shall such waiver be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent
such occurrence.

  



  

Section 11.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and
provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

Section 11.12 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.  In the event that an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of
the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. The Parties intend
that each representation, warranty and covenant contained herein shall have
independent significance. Any reference in this Agreement to a statute shall
be to such statute, as amended from time to time, and to the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. When reference is made in this Agreement
to an Exhibit, Appendix, Article, Section or subsection, such reference
shall be to an Exhibit, Appendix, Article, Section or subsection to or of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.  The table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and

Section 11.13 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that if, on or prior
to the Closing Date, any of the provisions of this Agreement or any other
document contemplated by this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would
occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult
to determine; and, therefore, on or prior to the Closing Date, the Parties
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof and thereof,
without proof of actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), in
addition to any other remedy hereunder, at law, in equity or otherwise. The
Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance
pursuant to the preceding sentence is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law
or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.

  



        
   

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement as of the date
first above written.

 ** _APPENDIX A_**

  



  

 **Modified GAAP**

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement "Modified GAAP" shall mean GAAP applied on a
basis consistent with the Company Financial Statements (including the Company
Balance Sheet), except as modified by this _Appendix A_. Use of different or
alternative accounting policies and methods that are otherwise in accordance
with GAAP is not permitted because such use violates this consistency
requirement. Specifically, the Company Balance Sheet shall not reflect any
"inconsistency" adjustments on the basis of "materiality".

  



  

Modified GAAP requires that these additional principles be applied with
respect to the preparation of the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital:

  



  

(i) _Adjustment of Reserves and Valuation Accounts_. The amount of any
reserve or valuation account shall be determined by applying methods,
practices, assumptions, policies, factors and underlying data consistent with
those used in determining the reserves or valuation accounts included in the
Company Balance Sheet; and there shall be no decreases in Closing Net Working
Capital due to changes made to any reserve or valuation account, and no new
reserve or valuation account (including contract reserves, purchase
accounting reserves, deferred Tax asset valuation accounts, allowances for
bad debts, inventory reserves of any kind (including those for
overabsorbed/applied overhead costs), warranty reserves and other reserves)
or other expense, write-off or similar charge against an asset, except to the
extent that such decreases in Closing Net Working Capital are, or such new
account, expense, write-off or similar charge is, required by material
changes in facts and events occurring after the Company Balance Sheet Date
and before the Closing Date.

  



  

(ii) _Adjustment of Liability and Accrual Accounts_. The amount of all
liability and accrual accounts shall be determined by applying methods,
practices, assumptions, policies, factors and underlying data consistent with
those used in determining the liability and accrual accounts included in the
Company Balance Sheet, and there shall be no decreases in Closing Net Working
Capital due to changes made to any liability and accrual accounts, and no new
liability or accrual account, except to the extent that such decreases in
Closing Net Working Capital are, or such new account is, required by material
changes in facts and events occurring after the Company Balance Sheet Date
and on or before the Closing Date.

  



  

(iii) _Documentation_. All facts and events described in (i) and (ii) above
must be documented and substantiated, and cannot be related solely to changes
in management estimates recorded by the Company after the Closing.

  



        
   

  



  

 ** _APPENDIX B_**

  



  

 ** _Value Schedule_**

  



  

The Parties agree that the combined fair market value of the Shares (which,
for avoidance of doubt, shall take into account the effect of the transfer of
assets to, and assumption of liabilities by, the Company pursuant to the
Contribution and Distribution Agreement) shall not be less than seventy
percent (70%) or more than eighty percent (80%) of the Purchase Price, so
that total Tax Consideration to be allocated among the assets of the Company
as of the end of the Closing Date shall be an amount that is the sum of (i)
not less than seventy percent (70%) or more than eighty percent (80%) of the
Purchase Price, and (ii) the liabilities of the Company as of the end of the
Closing Date (including for avoidance of doubt, the liabilities assumed by
the Company pursuant to the Contribution and Distribution Agreement) that are
properly includible in the Total Tax Consideration. Any adjustment to
the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.05 shall be treated as an
adjustment solely to the portion of the Purchase Price pursuant to the
foregoing sentence.

  



  

Consistent with the foregoing, the Parties agree that the combined fair
market value of the Purchased Assets (net of assumed liabilities) is equal to
the excess of the Purchase Price over the portion of the Purchase Price
allocated to the Shares (that is, not less than twenty percent (20%) or more
than thirty percent (30%) of the Purchase Price), so that the Total Tax
Consideration to be allocated among the Purchased Assets shall be an amount
that is the sum of (i) not less than twenty percent (20%) percent or more
than thirty percent (30%) of the Purchase Price, and (ii) the Assumed
Liabilities that are properly includible in the Total Tax Consideration.

  



  

The Parties further agree that they shall agree on the final percentage
allocation of the Purchase Price between the Stock Purchase and the Asset
Purchase on or before the Closing Date, which agreement shall be considered
to be an amendment to this _Appendix B_.

 ** _EXHIBIT E_**

  



  

 **Form of Business Transfer Agreement**

  



  

BUSINESS TRANSFER AGREEMENT

  



  

 **THIS** **BUSINESS TRANSFER AGREEMENT** (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered
into as of [ ], 2010, by and between [ **Local
Transferor s corporate name**], a [entity type] organized under the laws of
[ **jurisdiction** ] (the " _Transferor_ "), and Bruker AXS GmbH, a company
organized under the laws of Germany (the " _Transferee_ ").  Capitalized
terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed
to them in the Purchase Agreement (as defined below).

  



  

WHEREAS, the Transferor is an Affiliate of Veeco Instruments Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Seller_ "), and the Transferee is an Affiliate
of Bruker AXS Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of
Delaware (the " _Buyer_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, the Seller, the Buyer and [ ], an Arizona
corporation (the " _Company_ "), have entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement
(the " _Purchase Agreement_ ") pursuant to which, and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Buyer will purchase from the
Seller, and the Seller will sell to the Buyer, all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Company; and

  



  

WHEREAS, in connection with the Purchase Agreement, effective as of the
Closing Date, the Transferor will sell, convey, transfer and assign to the
Transferee, and the Transferee will purchase, accept and assume, the portions
of the business of the Company conducted by the Seller which consists of the
Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
covenants and agreements set forth herein and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

 **ARTICLE I**

  



  

 **BUSINESS TRANSFER**

  



  

Section 1.01 _Business Transfer_. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, as of the Closing, (i) the Transferor hereby sells,
conveys, transfers, assigns and delivers to the Transferee, and the
Transferee unconditionally purchases, acquires and accepts, the assets set
forth in Exhibit A hereto (the "Purchased Assets"), and (ii) the
Transferee hereby unconditionally assumes only the Liabilities of the
Transferor set forth in Exhibit B hereto or otherwise set forth in this
Agreement (the "Assumed Liabilities") and shall pay, satisfy and discharge
when due in accordance with their terms all of the Assumed Liabilities.  As
of the Closing, the Business Transfer shall (a) vest in the Transferee all
right, title and interest of the Transferor in and to the Purchased Assets,
and (b) obligate the Transferee to perform all duties and to assume and
fulfill the Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
the Transferor does not sell, convey, transfer, assign or deliver to
the Transferee, and the Transferee

        
   

  



  

does not purchase, acquire or accept, any assets other than the Purchased
Assets and (ii) the Transferee assumes only the Assumed Liabilities and not
any other Liability of the Transferor of whatever nature, whether presently
in existence or arising hereafter.

  



  

Section 1.02 _Approvals_. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement
to sell, convey, transfer or assign any interest in any asset, or any claim,
right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, or to assume any
Liability, if such a sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment or assumption, or
an attempt to make such a sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment
or assumption, without the authorization, approval, consent or waiver
(collectively, "Approval") of a third party would constitute a breach or
violation of any Contract, Order or Applicable Law, or affect adversely the
rights of the Transferor, the Transferee or any Affiliate of the Transferor
with respect to such asset or Liability; and any such sale, conveyance,
transfer, assignment or assumption that requires the Approval of a third
party shall be made only upon such Approval. The Transferor and
the Transferee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such
Approval as promptly as reasonably practicable.  In the event that any such
Approval is not obtained, the Transferor and the Transferee shall continue to
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Approval for a period of
not less than six (6) months after the Closing and shall cooperate with each
other in any reasonable arrangement to provide that the Transferee shall
receive all of the benefits, and bear all of the obligations, of the
Transferor in, to or under any Purchased Asset, and that the Transferee shall
perform all obligations of the Transferor under any Assumed Liability, with
respect to which such Approval is required.

  



  

Section 1.03 _Consideration_. [The consideration for transfer of
the Purchased Assets is (i) U.S.$  [, which forms part of the
Asset Purchase Price set forth in the Purchase Agreement,] (the "Purchase
Price") and (ii) the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities. The parties
acknowledge that the Seller will act as the agent for the Transferor in
receiving such consideration on behalf of the Transferor.]

  



  

 **ARTICLE II**

  



  

 **CLOSING**

  



  

Section 2.01 _Closing._ All matters at Closing will be considered to take
place simultaneously and no delivery of any document will be deemed complete

Section 6.03 _Amendments; No Waivers._ Any provision of this Agreement may
be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing
and signed, in the case of an amendment, by both parties to this Agreement,
and in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom such waiver is
adverse. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  The rights
and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 6.04 _Successors and Assigns._ The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties named herein

construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A.,
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware, U.S.A., or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Delaware, U.S.A.

  



  

Section 6.06 _Governing Language._ The English language will be the
definitive and controlling text of this Agreement, notwithstanding the
translation of this Agreement into any other language.

  



  

Section 6.07 _Headings; Counterparts._ The section headings contained in
this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.  This Agreement may be
executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.  The counterparts of this Agreement may be executed and delivered
by facsimile signature by either party to the other party, and the receiving
party may rely on the receipt of such document so executed and delivered by

Section 6.08 _Entire Agreement._ The Asset Purchase Documents constitute the
entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof, and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or between the parties, written or oral, to the extent
that they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  



  

Section 6.09 _Jurisdiction._ The parties hereto agree that any
Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter

contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal court located in the
State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts thereof) in any such Proceeding and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
Proceeding in any such court or any claim that any such Proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any
such Proceeding may be served on any party hereto anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without
limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such
party as provided in Section 6.02 shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  



  

Section 6.10 _Severability._ Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and
provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

Section 6.11 _Construction._ The parties hereto have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. The words
"including," "include" or "includes" shall mean including without limitation.
Any reference in this Agreement to a statute shall be to such statute, as
amended from time to time, and to the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.

forth herein or in any other Transaction Document, each party understands and
agrees that neither party hereto (nor any Person on behalf of either party
hereto) is representing or warranting to the other party in any way as to the
assets exchanged or Liabilities assumed hereunder.

2. _Purpose of Escrowed Funds_. The purpose of the Escrowed Funds is to, subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Purchase Agreement, secure (i) any post-Closing reduction in the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 1.05_ of the Stock Purchase Agreement (a " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ ") and (ii) the indemnification obligations set forth in _Section 9.01_ of the Stock Purchase Agreement.

  



  

3. _Post-Closing Adjustment_. If the Purchase Price is adjusted downward as a result of the final determination of the Closing Net Working Capital in accordance with _Section 1.05_ of the Stock Purchase Agreement, then within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the Closing Net Working Capital is finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.05_ of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Buyer and the Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent specifying the dollar amount of such downward adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.05_ of the Stock Purchase Agreement and instructing the Escrow Agent to release such amount to the Buyer.

Days thereafter), the Escrow Agent shall release to the Buyer from the
Escrowed Funds an amount equal to such specified dollar amount.

  



  

4. _Indemnification Claims_. The Buyer shall be entitled to make indemnification claims (the " _Indemnification Claims_ ") against the Escrowed Funds for Losses incurred by the Buyer or the Buyer Indemnified Parties in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Article IX_ of the Stock Purchase Agreement (subject to the limitations and requirements set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement and this Section 4). Any Indemnification Claim by the Buyer against the Escrowed Funds shall be presented to the Escrow Agent and the Seller as follows:

  



  

(a) Indemnification Claims against the Escrowed Funds may be made only by
the Buyer, on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Buyer
Indemnified Party. The Buyer shall provide the Escrow Agent and the Seller
with a written notice, pursuant to _Article IX_ of the Stock Purchase
Agreement, setting forth: (i) that the Indemnified Party has actually
incurred Losses in an aggregate stated amount; and (ii) a brief description,
in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably available to the Indemnified
Party), of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the Losses
actually incurred by the Indemnified Party, the amount of Losses actually
incurred by the Indemnified Party, the date each such item was incurred, and
the specific nature of the breach of the Stock Purchase Agreement to which
such item is related. In the case of a Third Party Claim, the Buyer shall
also provide the identity and address of the third-party claimant (to the
extent reasonably available to the Indemnified Party) and copies of any
formal demand or complaint.

  



  

(b) The Escrow Agent shall not release any amounts from the Escrowed Funds
in respect of any Indemnification Claim unless and until the validity of
such Indemnification Claim is finally resolved, either by mutual agreement of
the Buyer and the Seller or by a court of competent jurisdiction, and the
Escrow Agent receives joint written notice of such resolution from the Buyer
and the Seller stating the amount, if any, that any Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive with respect to such Indemnification Claim (a " _Resolved
Claim Notice_ "). Within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of a
Resolved Claim Notice that provides for the payment of any amount to the
Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnified Party, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to
such Person an amount equal to the amount set forth in the Resolved Claim
Notice.

  



  

5. _Amounts Earned on Escrow; Tax Matters_. The Parties agree that, for all income tax purposes, the Escrowed Funds shall be treated as owned by the Seller unless and until released to the Buyer pursuant to Sections 3 or 4 of this Agreement, so that all interest or other income earned from the investment of the Escrowed Funds shall be considered to be income of the Seller. The release of any portion of the Escrowed Funds to the Seller shall be treated as additional consideration paid, on the date of the release from the Escrowed Funds, on behalf of the Buyer pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, except to the extent that any amount so released to the Seller is required to be treated as interest pursuant to Section 1272 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Pursuant to the terms of the Patriot Act and the Escrow Agents internal policies, all signatories to agreements with the Escrow Agent must provide their tax identification numbers on IRS Form W-9. In addition, the Escrow Agents sales staff must run Dun and Bradstreet reports on all corporate signatories (which incorporates an Office of Foreign Assets Control check) and secure personal, photo identification from individuals

  



        
   

  



  

(passports, drivers license, etc). In the absence of Dun and Bradstreet
reports, articles of association, good standing certificates and other
documentation reasonably requested by the Escrow Agent shall be delivered by
the other parties hereto. All such Patriot Act documentation must be
furnished to the Escrow Agent prior to the execution of this Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall issue an IRS Form 1099 (or any successor
form) relating to such taxable income or gains to and in the name of the
Seller with respect to all earnings on the Escrowed Funds, and shall issue
such other information returns as required by law with respect to the
disbursement of the Escrowed Funds. At the request of the Seller from time
to time, the Buyer and the Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrowed Funds an amount equal to any
tax payable by the Seller with respect to interest or other income earned
from the investment of the Escrowed Funds.

  



  

6. _Release of Escrowed Funds_.

  



  

(a) The date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date is the "
_Release Date_." On the first Business Day after the Release Date, the
Escrow Agent shall disburse the Available Escrow Amount to the Seller. The "
_Available Escrow Amount_ " means all of the Escrowed Funds on such date,
less any amount that is subject to any pending Indemnification Claim made by
the Buyer prior to the Release Date which has not been resolved as of the
Release Date.

  



  

(b) Any amount of the Escrowed Funds retained after the Release Date
in respect of any pending Indemnification Claim shall not be subject to
or retained in respect of any other Indemnification Claim after such date
and shall be released (in whole or in part) by the Escrow Agent to the Buyer
or the Seller (as the case may be) upon the receipt by the Escrow Agent of
either: (i) a copy of a written settlement agreement executed by the Buyer
and the Seller resolving such pending Indemnification Claim with joint
instructions of the Buyer and the Seller that all or part of the Escrowed
Funds be released to the Buyer and/or the Seller; or (ii) a copy of a final
order or judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction instructing the Escrow
Agent to release all or part of the Escrowed Funds to the Buyer and/or the
Seller. If some but not all of the Escrowed Funds are released, the Escrow
Agent shall continue to hold the remaining part of the Escrowed Funds until
such time as it receives further joint instructions or a final order or
judgment, as described in this Section 6.

  



  

(c) In addition to, and without limitation of the foregoing provisions
of this Section 6, the Escrow Agent shall make distributions from
the Escrowed Funds any time and from time to time upon, and in accordance
with, joint written instructions from the Buyer and the Seller.

  



  

7. _Termination_. Unless terminated earlier with the joint written consent of the Buyer and the Seller, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until all of the Escrowed Funds shall have been released in accordance with the terms hereof.

  



        
   

  



  

8. _The Escrow Agent_.

  



  

(a) The Buyer and the Seller hereby appoint the Escrow Agent to act as
escrow agent and to hold the Escrowed Funds, and the Escrow Agent hereby
accepts such appointment, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein.

  



  

(b) The Buyer shall pay the Escrow Agents costs and fees for its
ordinary services under this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled
to an administrative fee of $[ ] per year for the
services to be rendered by it hereunder and to be reimbursed for all losses,
liabilities or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, incurred or made by it without gross negligence, bad faith
or willful misconduct arising out of or in connection with its entering into
this Agreement or carrying out its duties hereunder, including the costs and
expenses of defending itself against any claim of liability with respect to
this Agreement. Any such compensation and reimbursement to which the Escrow
Agent is entitled shall be borne 50% by the Buyer and 50% by the Seller.

  



  

(c) The duties and responsibilities of the Escrow Agent hereunder shall be
determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement. The Escrow
Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly set forth
herein and no further duties or responsibilities shall be implied.
The Escrow Agent shall not in any way be bound or affected by a notice
or modification or cancellation of this Agreement, unless written notice
thereof is given to the Escrow Agent by the Buyer and the Seller.

  



  

(d) In performing any duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall
not be liable for damages, losses, or expenses, except for gross
negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Escrow Agent.
The Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (i) any act or
failure to act made or omitted in good faith, or (ii) any action taken or
omitted in reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement or
affidavit provided for in this Agreement, that such agent shall in good faith
believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for
forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any
representative authority. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining
and verifying the authority of any such person acting or purporting to act on
behalf of any other party to this Agreement.

  



  

(e) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or
with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its
terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the
controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold
the Escrowed Funds and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by
final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the Escrow Agents
discretion, may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for interest or
damage. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an action of
interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and
rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with the
clerk of the court the entire Escrowed Funds. Upon initiating such action, the
Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from all
obligations and liabilities imposed by the terms of this Agreement, except
for obligations or liabilities arising by reason of the prior negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Escrow Agent.

  



        
   

  



  

(f) The Escrow Agent agrees that the Buyer and the Seller may, by
mutual agreement at any time, remove it as Escrow Agent hereunder and
substitute an individual or a bank or trust company for it, in which event
the Escrow Agent, upon receipt of written notice thereof, shall account for
and deliver to such substituted escrow agent all funds and obligations held
by it, less any amounts then due and unpaid to it for fees and expenses as
herein provided, and the Escrow Agent shall thereafter be discharged from all
liability hereunder for events arising after such removal.

  



  

(g) The Escrow Agent may at any time resign as such by delivering
written notice of resignation to the other parties hereto. If the Buyer and
the Seller jointly designate a successor escrow agent, then the Escrow Agent
shall deliver the Escrowed Funds to such successor escrow agent, whereupon
the Escrow Agent shall be discharged of any liability or responsibility with
respect thereto arising thereafter. If, within thirty (30) days after
receipt of such notice of resignation, the Buyer and the Seller have
not jointly designated a successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent may deposit
the Escrowed Funds into a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of [
], and upon such deposit, the Escrow Agent shall be relieved of any liability
or responsibility with respect thereto arising thereafter. Any corporation or
association into which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be

corporation or association to which all or substantially all the corporate
trust business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be sold or
otherwise transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent hereunder without further
action of the Buyer or the Seller hereunder.

 ** _EXHIBIT G_**

  



  

 **Transfer of Non-Company Employees and Non-U.S. Employees**

  



  

G.1. For a period of one (1) year after the Closing, at the cost and expense
of the Buyer or an Affiliate, the Buyer or its Affiliates will maintain the
current locations of a majority of the Field Offices of the Seller and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date and will continue to use each such Field
Office as the place of employment of the Non-Company Employees who were based
at such Field Office as of the Closing and who continue to be employed by, or
accept offers of employment with, the Buyer of an Affiliate.  For a period
of one (1) year after the Closing, the Buyer and its Affiliates shall not
move any Field Office if such a move would reasonably be expected to disrupt
the commutes of the employees in such Field Office.

  



  

G.2. The Seller and the Buyer will cooperate with each other in contacting
Non-Company Employees regarding offers of employment by the Buyer or its
Affiliates, subject to Applicable Law, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the signing of this Agreement. The Seller and the Buyer will arrange
for senior managers of each Party to conduct joint visits to each applicable
Seller or Company location and make joint presentations to Non-Company
Employees regarding the strategic benefits of the Transactions and the
benefits to Non-Company Employees of accepting such offers of employment.

  



  

G.3. Except for Non-Company Employees located in jurisdictions in which the
employment of the Non-Company Employees continues automatically as a result
of "transfer of undertaking" or similar foreign laws, the Buyer or its
Affiliates shall make a "qualified offer" to each of the Non-Company
Employees.  For any such employees who receive a "qualified offer" from the
Buyer or its Affiliates, the Seller shall notify such employees that if the
employees decline to accept such offer, the Seller or its Subsidiary, as
applicable, will terminate such employees and will not rehire such employees,
and the Seller or its Subsidiary shall offer such employees the severance
payment to which they are entitled from the Seller or its Subsidiary.  For
the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a dispute regarding the amount of
such severance, the Seller or its Subsidiary may settle such dispute in its
discretion. A "qualified offer" means salary and bonus or similar incentive
compensation equivalent to or better than the salary and bonus or similar
incentive compensation the employee currently has and other benefits
(including participation in equity incentive plans) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate for such employee than those provided to a
comparable employee of the Buyer or its Affiliates in the applicable
jurisdiction.

  



  

G.4. For the period from the Closing Date through the first (1st) anniversary
thereof, the Buyer or its Affiliate shall provide each Non-Company Employee
referred to in Section G.3 with (i) compensation (including salary, wages
and historical bonus potential but excluding any equity-based
compensation, transaction, severance or change of control bonuses or
payments) that is no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation
provided by the Seller or its Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing,
and (ii) employee benefits plans, programs and arrangements that in all
material respects are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee
benefits as in effect for other employees of the Buyer or its Affiliate in
the applicable countries immediately prior to the Closing.

  



        
   

  



  

G.5. For Non-Company Employees located in jurisdictions in which the
employment of the Non-Company Employees continues automatically as a result
of "transfer of undertaking" or similar foreign laws, the Buyer or its
Affiliate, as applicable, shall continue such employees employment in
accordance with Applicable Laws.

  



  

G.6. For a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date, the Seller shall
not, directly or indirectly, solicit or rehire any Non-Company Employee who
is offered employment by the Buyer or its Affiliates, whether such Non-
Company Employee accepts or declines such offer of employment.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall have the right to
employ any Non-Company Employee who is not offered employment by the Buyer or
its Affiliates.

  



  

G.7. If the employment of any Non-U.S. Employee listed on _Schedule G.6_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedules to whom the Buyer or an Affiliate does not
wish to offer employment otherwise would continue after the Closing as a
result of "transfer of undertaking" or similar foreign laws, the Seller shall
use reasonable efforts prior to the Closing to negotiate a separation
arrangement with such Non-U.S. Employee and shall be responsible for any
separation payment to such Non-U.S. Employee. If the Seller is unable to
negotiate such an arrangement and the employment of such Non-U.S. Employee is
continued with the Buyer or an Affiliate after the Closing as a result of
such laws, the Seller will be responsible for reimbursing the Buyer or such
Affiliate for fifty percent (50%) of the compensation paid by the Buyer or
such Affiliate to such Non-U.S. Employee for up to six (6) months after the
Closing and for reimbursing the Buyer or such Affiliate for any
mandatory severance (up to the amount that would have been payable if the
Seller had severed such Non-U.S. Employee as of the Closing) if the Buyer or
such Affiliate terminates such Non-U.S. Employee during such six (6)
month period.

  



  

G.8. The Seller represents that no employees of the Seller (other than the
employees specified on Schedule G.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedules) will
ever assert that they dedicated greater than 50% of their time to the
metrology business of the Company and consequently are entitled to be
employed by the Buyer. In the event any such employee makes any such claim,
the Seller shall indemnify the Buyer for any Losses arising from such claim.

  



  

G.9. The Buyer shall indemnify the Seller and its Affiliates for any
severance payments or similar costs relating to the Non-Company Employees
incurred by the Seller or its Affiliates arising from any actions or
inactions of the Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing, except for the
costs agreed to be borne by the Seller in Section G.6. The Seller shall
indemnify the Buyer and its Affiliates for any severance payments or similar
costs relating to the Non-Company Employees incurred by the Buyer or its
Affiliates arising from any actions or inactions of the Seller or its
Affiliates before the Closing, except for the costs agreed to be borne by the
Buyer under this Agreement.

  



  

G.10. At any time prior to the Closing, the Seller may transfer, or cause to
be transferred, to the Company any Non-Company Employees; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Seller shall not increase the compensation or benefits
of such employees in connection with such transfer, except in the Ordinary
Course of Business.

  



        
   

  



  

G.11. The Seller shall pay (i) the bonus compensation and profit sharing
liabilities set forth on Schedule 5.08 of the Company Disclosure Schedules
(which amounts shall be prorated for the partial year ended on the Closing
Date and shall expressly exclude any accrued sales commissions) within thirty
(30) days after the Closing and (ii) the transaction incentive payments and
severance payments set forth on Schedule 5.08 of the Company Disclosure
Schedules within thirty (30) days after the Closing or at such later date as
is contemplated by the applicable agreement governing any such payments.

  



  

G.12. With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy
or arrangement (including the severance plans, policies, or arrangements, and
paid time off, vacation, and sick leave policies of the Transferee or
its Affiliates) maintained by the Transferee or its Affiliates and in which
any of the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees become eligible to participate (the
" _Transferee Plans_ "), for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting and benefit accrual, employment service with the
applicable Transferor (or predecessor employers to the extent the applicable
Transferor provides past service credit) shall be treated as employment
service with the Transferee and/or any of its applicable Affiliates;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such prior employment service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits. Such credit for prior employment service also shall apply for
purposes of satisfying any waiting periods or evidence of insurability
requirements applicable under any of the Transferee Plans. To the extent
applicable, the Transferee or its Affiliate shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each of the applicable Transferee Plans to (i)
waive all limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of
insurability requirements and waiting periods with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable to Non-U.S. Transferred Employees and
their eligible dependents under the Transferee Plans, except to the extent
that such limitations, evidence of insurability and waiting periods were
applicable to such individuals under a comparable benefit plan of the
applicable Transferor, and (ii) give Non-U.S. Transferred Employees and their
eligible dependents credit under the Transferee Plans for amounts paid during
the year in which the Closing occurs under a corresponding benefit plan of
the applicable Transferor for purposes of satisfying any applicable
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts
had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Transferee
Plans.

  



  

G.13. The Transferee or its Affiliate shall honor all balances under the
vacation, paid time off and sick leave policies of the applicable Transferor
accrued by Non-U.S. Transferred Employees to the extent set forth in the
Statement of Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined in accordance
with Section 1.05 of the Agreement; provided, however, that the Transferee or
its Affiliate shall not be required to honor such balances for a Non-U.S.
Employee to the extent that (i) the applicable Transferor or any Affiliate is
required by Applicable Law to pay off the cash value of such balances of such
Non-U.S. Transferred Employee in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions, or (ii) any such balance (on a per employee basis) exceeds the
sum of two (2) weeks and the aggregate number of 2010 annual vacation, paid
time off and sick leave days accrued for the account of such Non-U.S.
Transferred Employee as of the Closing Date. All such balances that are not
required to be honored by the Transferee or its Affiliate pursuant to the
limitations described in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be paid by the
Seller or a Subsidiary of the Seller (other than the Company) at or promptly
following the Closing, except as otherwise required by Applicable Law.

  



        
   

  



  

G.14. The parties shall (or shall cause their respective Affiliates to) take
all steps, as soon as possible, as are required under Applicable Law and/or
any applicable collective bargaining, works council or similar agreement, to
notify, consult with, or negotiate the effect, impact, terms or timing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with each works council, trade
union, employee representative group or Governmental Body as early as
possible after the signing of this Agreement.

  



  

G.15. Nothing contained in the Agreement, including this Exhibit G, expressed
or implied, is intended to confer upon any Non-U.S. Employee any benefits
under any employee benefit plan, fund or program, including severance
benefits or the right to employment or continued employment with the Buyer,
the Transferee or any Affiliate for any period by reason of this Agreement.
In addition, the provisions of the Agreement, in particular this Exhibit G,
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
Affiliates and are not for the benefit of any third parties.

  



  

G.16. The Buyer and the Seller shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, use reasonable efforts to effect the transfer of
the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees from each Transferor to the Transferee or
its Affiliates in accordance with Applicable Law. A Transferor may terminate
the employment of any Non-U.S. Employee who does not become a Non-U.S.
Transferred Employee on the Closing Date. The Buyer and the Seller shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use reasonable efforts to
eliminate or minimize any Losses incurred (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any severance or other termination-related payments made) by any party
(i) in connection with the transfer of the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees to
the Transferee or an Affiliate hereunder, (ii) in connection with
the termination or any deemed termination of a Non-U.S. Employee, or (iii)
arising or in connection with a refusal of any Non-U.S. Employee to become a
Non-U.S. Transferred Employee.

in the Purchase Agreement (defined below).

  



  

 _RECITALS_

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated 
  , 2010 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), by and among the Seller, the
Company and [ ], a [  
] (the " _Buyer_ "), (i) the Buyer has agreed to purchase from the Seller,
and the Seller has agreed to sell to the Buyer, all of the capital stock of
the Company, and (ii) the Buyer, through itself or one or more of its direct
or indirect Subsidiaries, has agreed to purchase and assume from the Seller
or one or more of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, and the
Seller, through itself or one or more of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries,
has agreed to sell, transfer and assign to the Buyer or one of more of
its Subsidiaries, certain assets and liabilities described in the

WHEREAS, the Company is interested in obtaining certain transition services
from the Seller following the Closing Date, subject to the terms and
conditions contained herein; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Seller desires to provide the Company with certain transition
services following the Closing Date, subject to the terms and conditions
contained herein.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and covenants set forth
herein, the Seller and the Company each hereby agree as follows:

  



  

 _AGREEMENT_

  



  

1. _Transition Services_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein, the Seller shall provide, or shall cause one or more of its Service Providers (defined below) to provide, to the Company the services described on _Schedule A_ attached hereto (each, a " _Transition Service_ " and collectively, the " _Transition Services_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Service Providers_ " shall mean (a) any subsidiary or affiliate of the Seller, (b) any independent contractor that is providing services to the Seller on the Closing Date as identified on a list of Service Providers furnished by the Seller to the Company no later than the execution hereof, and (c) such other third parties as may from time to time be designated in writing by the Seller to the Company and accepted by the Company, which acceptance shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld. The Company shall have the right to contract directly with any Service Provider and

        
   

  



  

terminate the work performed by such Service Provider from the scope of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 3(b). The Seller shall have the right, in its
sole discretion, to subcontract any or all of the work to be performed by the
Seller under this Agreement. In the event of any such subcontract, the
Company shall have the right to enter into an agreement directly with such
proposed subcontractor. The Seller and the Company also agree to take the
other transition-related actions set forth in _Schedule B_ attached hereto.

  



  

2. _Level of Transition Services_.

  



  

(a) The Seller will perform the Transition Services in the manner and at a
level of service, functionality and performance, with respect to any
Transition Service, substantially similar to that provided by the Seller to
the Company during the period immediately prior to the Closing; provided,
however, in no event will the Seller be required to (i) favor the Company or
the provision of the Transition Services over the Sellers other business
operations, provided that the treatment of the Company by the Seller in such
regard shall be consistent with that of the Seller towards the Company prior
to the date hereof, (ii) purchase, lease or license any additional equipment
or software in connection with the Transition Services, or (iii) pay any
costs related to the transfer or conversion of data to the Company or any
alternative supplier of the Transition Services. If there is an unavoidable
conflict between the immediate needs of the Seller and those of the Company
as to the use of or access to a particular Transition Service, the Seller
will have the right, in its sole discretion, to establish reasonable
priorities, at particular times and under particular circumstances, as
between the Parties so long as such priorities are consistent with prior
practice between the Seller and the Company in such regard prior to the date
hereof and so long as the establishment of any such reasonable priorities is
done in conjunction and cooperation with the Company in good faith.

  



  

(b) The Parties agree that it is the intention of the Company and the Seller
that the Companys use of the Transition Services shall be for substantially
the same purposes as immediately prior to the Closing and shall not be
materially greater than the use required by the Company immediately prior to
the Closing (including as to volume, amount, level and frequency, as
applicable), except for Transition Services (including, without limitation,
the IP Transition Services set forth in Section III ("Information Technology
Services") of _Schedule A_) that would not have been required by the Company
but for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement, which the Parties acknowledge may require more or additional
resources than were previously required by the Company.

  



  

(c) Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries shall resell any Transition
Services to any person whatsoever or permit the use of the Transition
Services by any person other than in connection with the conduct of the
business of the Company or its subsidiaries.

  



  

(d) The Company agrees that the Transition Services provided by the Seller or
any Service Provider, and any other assets licensed or leased from third
parties and used in connection with the Transition Services, remain subject
to the terms and conditions of any subcontracts or other agreements between
the Seller, such Service Providers or other third parties, and the Company
shall adhere to such terms and conditions.

  



  

(e) The parties shall cooperate with each other to provide each other such

  



        
   

  



  

information, materials and other cooperation that in the reasonable judgment
of the requesting party are necessary to enable the requesting party to
perform its obligations hereunder.

  



  

3. _Term and Termination_.

  



  

(a) The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and
continue with respect to each of the Transition Services for the respective
terms set forth in _Schedule A_ , unless earlier terminated pursuant to
Section 3(b), and the last date in each such term being referred to herein as
a " _Service Termination Date_ " for each such Transition Service.

  



  

(b) The Company may terminate any Transition Service by giving the Seller
prior written notice of termination of the Transition Service as set forth in
_Schedule A_. As soon as reasonably practical following receipt of any such
notice, the Seller shall advise the Company as to whether termination of such
Transition Service will (i) require the termination or partial termination
of, or otherwise affect the provision of, any other Transition Services, or
(ii) result in any early termination costs, including those related to third
party providers. Upon such termination of any Transition Service, the Seller
shall cease, and cause its Service Providers to cease, providing the
terminated Transition Service; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall reimburse the Seller for any reasonable out of pocket termination costs
actually payable by the Seller to Service Providers resulting from the
Companys early termination of such Transition Services, as long as the
Seller provided the Company notice of such termination costs after
the Company submitted its notice of proposed termination of the
applicable Transition Service.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement will terminate in its
entirety upon the earliest to occur of the following dates (the "
_Termination Date_ "): (i)(A) the date on which the Seller gives written
notice of termination to the Company if the Company is in default of any
payment obligation to the Seller hereunder or if the Company is in default of
or breaches any other provision of this Agreement which default or breach is
not capable of being cured within thirty (30) days after the Companys
receipt of notice of such default or breach from the Seller, or (B) if the
Company is in default of or breaches any other provision of this Agreement
which default or breach is capable of being cured, and such default or breach
has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the Companys receipt of
notice of such default or breach from the Seller; or (ii) the date on which
the Seller or the Company gives written notice of termination to the other
Party at any time following the last of the Service Termination Dates.

  



  

(d) Effective as of the Termination Date, the Seller shall cease, and cause
its Service Providers to cease, providing the Transition Services.

  



  

4. _General Intent._ The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce and discontinue its use of the Transition Services as soon as reasonably possible following the Effective Date and in all events to end use with respect to each Transition Service not later than the applicable Service Termination Date.

  



  

5. _Fees_.

  



  

(a) _Consideration_. As consideration for the Transition Services, the
Company will pay to the Seller (or to the Sellers Service Providers,
if requested by the Seller) the amount for each Transition Service as
specified in  _Schedule A_ with respect to such Transition Service.

  



        
   

  



  

The Seller and Service Providers, as applicable, shall be entitled to charge
the Company for any sales tax, withholding tax, or similar charges that they
are legally required to charge or withhold on such amounts. Amounts payable
hereunder will be billed and paid in U.S. dollars. If there is no fee
specified in  _Schedule A_ for a particular Transition Service, then the
Seller shall be entitled to charge the Company for (i) 100% of any out-of-
pocket expenses paid by the Seller to a third party for such Transition
Service and (ii) 50% of the Sellers internal cost allocable to such
Transition Service, including a fair and reasonable allocation for the
Sellers wage or salary and employee benefit costs relating to employees
providing such Transition Service and for the Sellers facilities and other
overhead. In addition to the Transition Services fees set forth herein, the
Company shall also pay any amounts the Seller is required to pay to a vendor
for software used by the Seller in connection with the provision of any
Transition Services, and any amounts the Seller is required to pay to a
vendor to obtain its consent to allow the Seller to use such software to
provide the Transition Services, provided that the Seller shall consult
with the Company in good faith in connection therewith and the parties shall
work together in good faith to minimize any such amounts.

  



  

(b) _Invoices_. Within twenty (20) days after the end of each month, the
Seller will submit one (1) invoice to the Company for all fees and expenses
relating to the Transition Services provided to the Company by the Seller and
its Service Providers; provided, that the Seller may instruct the Company to
make payments directly to one or more Service Providers.

  



  

(c) _Payment Due Date_. The Company will pay all amounts due pursuant to this
Agreement within thirty (30) days after the date of each invoice. Interest
shall be due and payable by the Company at the rate of 1.5% per month or the
maximum legal rate, whichever is lower, on any undisputed portion of an
invoice which has not been paid within such thirty (30) day period. In
addition to the charges for the Transition Services provided hereunder, the
Company will reimburse the Service Providers (at cost) for any and all actual
out-of-pocket ancillary fees, costs, or expenses incurred by the respective
Service Provider in connection with providing Transition Services hereunder,
including shipping and transportation costs, duties, and taxes in accordance
with the applicable agreements between the Seller and such Service Providers.

  



  

6. _Personnel_.

  



  

(a) _Right to Designate and Change Personnel_. The Seller will make
available such personnel as will be required to provide the Transition
Services. The Seller may, in its sole discretion, designate which personnel
will perform the Transition Services. The Seller also may, in its sole
discretion and with at least ten (10) days prior written notice to the
Company if feasible, remove and replace any such personnel at any time
or, subject to Section 1 hereof, designate any Service Provider at any time
to perform the Transition Services; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to limit the disruption to the
Company in the transition of the Transition Services to different
personnel or a third party but the Seller will have no obligation to retain
any individual employee for the sole purpose of providing the applicable
Transition Services. Further, in providing the Transition Services, the
Seller shall not be obligated to hire any additional personnel.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) _Personnel Wages and Expenses_. The Seller and its Service Providers will
pay for all personnel expenses, including wages and benefits, of their
employees and agents performing the Transition Services.  Any request by the
Company for travel by any employee or agent of the Seller or any Service
Provider will be considered additional services, and the costs and expenses
relating to such travel shall be paid by the Company, provided that any such
travel and related expenses shall be in accordance with the Sellers standard
travel policies for its own employees or, if applicable, in accordance with
the agreement between the Seller and the applicable Service Provider.

  



  

(c) _Seller Manager_. The Seller will appoint an employee (the "
_Seller Manager_ ") to have overall responsibility for coordinating the
delivery of the Transition Services. The Seller Manager will coordinate and
consult with the Company Manager (as defined in _Section 6(d)_) regarding
the provision of the Transition Services. The Seller may, in its sole
discretion, change the individual designated to serve as the Seller Manager
upon at least ten (10) days prior written notice to the Company if feasible.

  



  

(d) _Company Manager_. The Company will appoint an employee (the "
_Company Manager_ ") to have overall responsibility for coordinating the
receipt of the Transition Services. The Company Manager will coordinate and
consult with the Seller Manager regarding the delivery of the Transition
Services. The Company may, in its sole discretion, change the individual
designated to serve as the Company Manager upon at least ten (10) days prior
written notice to the Seller if feasible.

  



  

7. _Confidentiality_. Neither Party shall disclose or use any Confidential Information (defined below) of the other Party without the prior written consent of such other Party except as expressly permitted under this Agreement. Such restrictions do not extend to any item of information that (a) is or becomes publicly available without the fault of the receiving Party; (b) is disclosed or made available to the receiving Party by a third party without restriction and without breach of any relationship of confidentiality; or (c) is independently developed by the receiving Party without use of the disclosing Partys Confidential Information. It shall not be a breach of this Section 7 if Confidential Information is disclosed pursuant to subpoena or other compulsory judicial or administrative process, provided the Party served with such subpoena or process promptly notifies the other Party and provides reasonable assistance so that the other Party may seek a protective order against public disclosure. In addition, either Party shall have the right without having the obligation to obtain the prior consent of the other Party to disclose this Agreement or the existence of this Agreement if such Party is required to do so by the U.S. securities laws or the rules and regulations of the stock exchange upon which such Partys stock is listed. The obligations of confidentiality set forth in this Section 7 shall be in addition to, and shall not amend, modify or otherwise limit, any obligations of confidentiality or non-disclosure as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Confidential Information_ " means any information that may be disclosed or submitted by one Party to another Party that is marked or identified as confidential or which a reasonable person in the industry would consider to be confidential, including, without limitation, trade secrets, processes, techniques, drawings, designs, models, customer-related information and data, computer programs (in object code or source code), databases, business plans, technical data, product ideas, marketing data, contracts and financial information.

  



         
 

  



  

8. _IT Services_. If the Company uses any of the Sellers office equipment, telephones, computers or data processing, internet or communications services (whether or not identified in _Schedule A_ ), the Company shall adhere in all respects to the Sellers corporate information policies as in effect from time to time including, without limitation, policies with respect to protection of confidential information, data privacy and other policies regarding the use of such resources.

  



  

9. _No Warranty; Limitation of Liability; Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) _No Warranty_. THE SELLER AND THE COMPANY EACH ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE
THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN _SECTION 2 (A)_, THE SELLER HAS AGREED TO
PROVIDE THE TRANSITION SERVICES HEREUNDER AS AN ACCOMMODATION TO THE COMPANY
AND THAT THE SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER,
WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO THE
TRANSITION SERVICES OR ANY OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT.

  



  

(b) _Limitation of Liability_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION SET FORTH
IN THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT WILL
THE SELLER, OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, BE LIABLE
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, COLLATERAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, IN
CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIMS, LOSSES, DAMAGES OR INJURIES ARISING HEREUNDER,
INCLUDING SCHEDULES OR EXHIBITS HERETO. IN NO EVENT WILL THE SELLERS TOTAL
AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE FEES RECEIVED BY
THE SELLER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR THE TRANSITION SERVICES.

  



  

(c) _Seller Indemnification_. THE SELLER SHALL HAVE NO OBLIGATION UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY THE COMPANY FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS OR FOR ANY OTHER
REASON WHATSOEVER. THE SELLERS OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY THE COMPANY, IF ANY,
SHALL BE AS SET FORTH IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND SUBJECT TO THE TERMS,
CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH THEREIN.

  



  

10. _Indemnity_. The Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller and each Service Provider and their respective employees, agents, officers and directors from and against any and all claims, demands, complaints, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses (collectively, " _Damages_ ") arising from the negligent acts or omissions or willful misconduct of the Company or its Affiliates and their respective employees and agents in connection with the Transition Services. The Seller will provide prompt written notice to the Company of any such Damages and will provide the Company with reasonable cooperation in the defense thereof, at the Companys expense.

  



  

11. _Relationship of the Parties_. The Seller is and will remain at all times an

  



        
   

  



  

independent contractor of the Company in the performance of the Transition
Services.  In all matters relating to this Agreement, each Party will be
solely responsible for the acts of its employees and agents, and employees or
agents of one Party shall not be considered employees or agents of the
other Party. Except as otherwise provided herein, no Party will have any
right, power or authority to create any obligation, express or implied, on
behalf of any other Party nor shall either Party act or represent or hold
itself out as having authority to act as an agent or partner of the other
Party, or in any way bind or commit the other Party to any obligations.
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to create or constitute a joint
venture, partnership, agency, trust or other association of any kind between
the Parties or persons referred to herein and each Party shall be responsible
only for its respective obligations as set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

12. _Compliance with Laws_. Each Party will comply with all applicable laws, rules, ordinances and regulations of any governmental entity or regulatory agency governing the Transition Services. No Party will take any action in violation of any applicable law, rule, ordinance or regulation that could reasonably be expected to result in liability being imposed on the other Party.

  



  

13. _Binding Effect and Assignment_. This Agreement binds and benefits the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. The Company may not assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without the written consent of the Seller, which consent may be withheld in the Sellers sole and absolute discretion and any assignment or attempted assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void.  The Seller may delegate its duties to provide the Transition Services hereunder in the manner permitted under Section 1, Section 6(a) and Section 6(c) of this Agreement.

  



  

14. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement and the Purchase Agreement (and the agreements and other documents referred to herein and therein) constitute the final agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and are the complete and exclusive statement of the Parties agreement on the matters contained herein and therein. All prior and contemporaneous negotiations and agreements between the Parties with respect to the matters contained herein are superseded by this Agreement. The Parties may amend this Agreement only by a written agreement signed by both Parties that identifies itself as an amendment to this Agreement.

  



  

15. _Force Majeure_. In the event that the Seller or any Service Provider is delayed in, or prevented from, performing its obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, due to an act of God, fire, flood, storm, explosion, civil disorder, strike, lockout or other labor trouble, material shortages of utilities, facilities, labor, materials or equipment, delay in transportation, breakdown or accident, any law, order, proclamation, regulation, ordinance, demand or requirement of any governmental authority, riot, war, acts of terror, rebellion, or other cause beyond the reasonable control of the Seller or the applicable Service Provider (each a " _Force Majeure Event_ "), then (a) the affected provisions and/or other requirements of this Agreement shall be suspended to the extent necessary during the period of such disability, and (b) the Seller shall have no liability to the Company or any other party in connection therewith. The Seller shall resume full performance of this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable following the conclusion of the Force Majeure Event.

  



        
   

  



  

16. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force, if the essential terms and conditions of this Agreement for each Party remain valid, binding and enforceable.

  



  

17. _Counterparts_. The Parties may execute this Agreement in multiple counterparts, each of which constitutes an original of the Party that signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement. The signatures of both Parties need not appear on the same counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or email transmission that includes a copy of the sending Partys signature is as effective as signing and delivering the counterpart in person.

  



  

18. _Notices_. All notices required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be hand delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, private industry express courier (with written confirmation of receipt) or facsimile (with a confirmation letter of the facsimile) to the address specified below or to such changed address as may have been previously specified in writing by the addressed party:
