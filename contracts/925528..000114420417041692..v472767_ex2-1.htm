respectively (the " _Purchase Price_ ").

  



  

(b)  Closing Adjustment. At least five (5) Business Days before

(d)  Examination and Review.

  



  

(i)  Examination. After receipt of the Closing Statement,
Seller shall have 45 days (the " _Review Period_ ") to review the Closing
Statement. During the Review Period, Seller and Seller\'s accountants shall
have full access to the books and records of the Company, the personnel of,
and work papers prepared by, Buyer and/or Buyer's accountants to the
extent that they relate to the Closing Statement and to such historical
financial information of the Company (to the extent in Buyer\'s possession)
relating to the Closing Statement as Seller may reasonably request for the
purpose of reviewing the Closing Statement and to prepare a Statement of
Objections (defined below), _provided, that_ (x) such access shall be in a
manner that does not interfere with the normal business operations of Buyer
or the Company and (y) that Buyer's accountants shall not be obligated to
make any work papers available to Seller unless and until Seller has signed a
customary confidentiality agreement relating to access to work papers in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer's accountants.

  



  

(ii)  Objection. On or prior to the last day of the Review
Period, Seller may object to the Closing Statement by delivering to Buyer a
written statement setting forth Seller\'s objections in reasonable detail,
indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for Seller\'s
disagreement therewith or a statement that the requisite amount of R-22
Inventory as reflected in the Closing Statement is inaccurate or otherwise
does not trigger the application of the Post-Closing Adjustment (the "
_Statement of Objections_ "). If Seller fails to deliver the Statement of
Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Statement
and the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, reflected in the Closing
Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by Seller. If Seller delivers
the Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, Buyer
and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections within 30
days after the delivery of the Statement of Objections (the " _Resolution
Period_ "), and, if the same are so resolved within the Resolution Period, the
Post-Closing Adjustment and the Closing Statement with such changes as may
have been previously agreed in writing by Buyer and Seller, shall be final
and binding.

  



  

(iii)  Resolution of Disputes. If Seller and Buyer fail to reach an
agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of
Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any amounts
remaining in dispute (" _Disputed Amounts_ " and any amounts not so disputed,
the " _Undisputed Amounts_ ") shall be submitted for resolution to the
applicable office of RSM US LLP or, if such firm is unable to serve, Buyer and
Seller shall appoint by mutual agreement the office of an impartial
nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants other
than Seller's accountants or Buyer's accountants (the " _Independent
Accountants_ ") who, acting as experts and not arbitrators, shall resolve the
Disputed Amounts only and make any adjustments to the Post-Closing Adjustment,
as the case may be, and the Closing Statement. The parties hereto agree that
all adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality. The Independent
Accountants shall only decide the specific items under dispute by the
parties, and their decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the range
of values assigned to each such item reflected in the Closing Statement and
the Statement of Objections, respectively.

  



  

   

 | 13| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iv)  Fees of the Independent Accountants. The fees and expenses
of the Independent Accountant shall be shared equally by Seller and Buyer.

  



  

(v)  Determination by Independent Accountants. The Independent
Accountants shall make a determination as soon as practicable within 30 days
(or such other time as the parties hereto shall agree in writing) after their
engagement, and their resolution of the Disputed Amounts and their
adjustments to the Closing Statement and/or the Post-Closing Adjustment shall
be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.

  



  

(e)  Payments of Post-Closing Adjustment. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any payment of the Post-Closing Adjustment shall (A) be due
(x) within ten Business Days of acceptance of the applicable Closing Statement
or (y) if there are Disputed Amounts, then within ten Business Days of the
resolution described in clause (v) above; and (B) be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account as is directed by Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be. The amount of any Post-Closing Adjustment shall
bear no interest.

  



  

(f)  Adjustments for Tax Purposes. Any payments made pursuant
to Section 2.02(e) shall be treated as an adjustment to the Estimated
Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
Law. The Parties should work in good faith to revise the Internal Revenue
Service (" _IRS_ ") Form 8883 if it has not yet been filed, or to amend
the IRS Form 8883 if it has.

other applicable Law, no Benefit Plan provides benefits or coverage in the

or benefits (including funding of compensation or benefits through a trust or
otherwise) to any Employee, director or consultant, except as a result of any
partial plan termination resulting from this Agreement, in each case, as a

Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
result in "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of
the Code.

  



  

(f)  The Company is in compliance in all material respects with
the provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other Laws applicable to the

(h)  No Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined under Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) or any
related agreement or arrangement has been administered or documented in a
manner that would reasonably be likely to cause Buyer, the Company or any
service provider of the Company to incur any material liability under Section
409A of the Code and the final regulations and other guidance issued
thereunder. No service provider who currently provides or formerly
provided services to the Company is entitled to any gross-up or reimbursement
for any taxes imposed under Section 409A of the Code.

of counsel, is appropriate in advance of the Closing Date to comply with
applicable Laws. All requests by Buyer for access pursuant to this Section
6.02 shall be submitted or directed exclusively to Representatives of Seller
or such other individuals as Seller may designate in writing from time to
time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Seller nor the Company shall be required to disclose any information to
Buyer if such disclosure would, in Seller's reasonable discretion: (x) cause
significant competitive harm to Seller, the Company and their respective
businesses if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
consummated; (y) jeopardize any attorney-client or other privilege of Seller
or the Company; or (z) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or
binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. Prior to
the Closing, without the prior written consent of Seller, which may be
withheld for any reason, Buyer shall not contact any suppliers to, or
customers of, the Company (unless they are also suppliers to, or
customers of, Buyer or its Affiliates, but in all cases subject to the
restrictions set forth in Section 6.07); provided that, following the
satisfaction of the condition to the Closing set forth in Section 3.01(a),
Seller's consent to such contact may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed (it being understood that it shall be considered
reasonable to withhold such consent if Seller reasonably determines (I) on
the advice of counsel, may potentially cause concerns under antitrust Laws or
(II) such contact would, in Seller's judgment, harm Seller or the Company
should the Closing not occur). Buyer shall have no right to perform invasive
or subsurface investigations of the Real Property. Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, abide by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement and Clean Team Addendum thereto with respect to any access or
information provided pursuant to this Section 6.02; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller agrees that Buyer and its Affiliates and representatives may (i)
share non-public or confidential information regarding Seller with the Lenders
or other financing sources in respect of the Debt Financing and (ii) share
such information with additional potential financing sources in connection
with any marketing efforts (including any syndication) in connection with the
Debt Financing, provided, in each case, that the recipients of
such information agree to be "Representatives" as that terms is defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(b)  To the extent any of the books and records of the Company
described in Section 4.10(d) remain in the possession of Seller or any of its
Affiliates after the Closing, upon identification by Seller or any of its
Affiliates of such books and records, or upon reasonable written request from
Buyer for such books and records, Seller shall deliver or cause to be
delivered such books and records to Buyer or the Company (as designated in
writing by Buyer) and the parties shall reasonably agree in consultation with
each other as to the method and timing of such delivery.

Section 6.03 Supplement to Seller Disclosure Letter; Notification of
Developments.

  



  

(a)  From time to time prior to the Closing, Seller shall have
the right (but not the obligation) to supplement or amend the Seller
Disclosure Letter with respect to any matter hereafter arising after the date
hereof which, if existing or occurring at the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be set forth or described in the Seller Disclosure
Letter (each a " _Schedule Supplement_ "), by delivering a Schedule
Supplement to the Buyer. No such Schedule Supplement shall have any effect
on the satisfaction of the conditions in Section 3.02. If the Closing occurs,
then thereafter for purposes of determining breach of any representation or
warranty made on the date of this Agreement or on the Closing Date for
purposes of Article VII and rights to indemnification thereunder, the Seller
Disclosure Letter will be deemed to also contain each item in each Schedule
Supplement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for any breach of any
representation or warranty made on the date of this Agreement or on the
Closing Date in connection with which a supplement or amendment is delivered
in accordance with this Section 6.03(a) and which does not give Buyer the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(ii) (whether
such breach is taken alone or combined with any other such breaches that
occurred on the date of this Agreement), the Schedule Update will have no
effect on Buyer's rights under Article VII.

  



  

(b)  Buyer will give prompt written notice to the Seller if it
becomes aware of any material adverse development causing a breach of any of
the representations and warranties in Article IV, as such representations and
warranties have been amended and/or qualified pursuant to a Schedule
Supplement after the expiration of any applicable termination right by Buyer.
No disclosure by Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.03(b), however, shall be
deemed to prevent or cure any misrepresentation or breach of warranty.

  



  

Section 6.04 Resignations. Seller shall deliver to Buyer written
resignations, effective as of the Closing Date, of the officers and directors
of the Company requested by Buyer in writing at least ten Business Days prior
to the Closing.

  



  

Section 6.05 Employees; Benefit Plans.

  



  

(a)  During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on
the date which is twelve months from the Closing (or if earlier, the date of
the employee\'s termination of employment with the Company), Buyer shall and
shall cause the Company to provide each Employee who remains employed by the
Company immediately after the Closing (" _Company Continuing Employee_
") with: (i) base salary or hourly wages which are not materially less than
the base salary or hourly wages provided by the Company immediately prior to
the Closing; (ii) bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation),
if any, which are comparable to those provided by Buyer to its employees of
similar rank or title as of immediately prior to the Closing; (iii)
retirement and welfare benefits which are comparable those provided by Buyer
to its employees of similar rank or title immediately prior to the Closing;
and (iv) severance benefits having such terms and on such conditions as Buyer
may determine in its commercially reasonable discretion. Seller acknowledges
and agrees that Seller, and not Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, the Company), shall be responsible for any severance
benefits due and payable under any severance arrangement with respect to any
employee of the Company terminated prior to the Closing (whether by payment as
such severance benefits become due and payable or pursuant to Section 6.19
hereof) and that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require any
minimum level of severance benefits to be provided to Company Continuing
Employees following the Closing.

  



  

   

 | 38| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b)  With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by
Buyer or its subsidiaries (collectively, " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ ") in which
any Company Continuing Employees will participate effective as of the Closing,
Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, (i) recognize all service of the
Company Continuing Employees with the Company or its Affiliates (as set forth
in the books and records of the Company with respect to the Benefit Plans) as
if such service were with Buyer, for vesting and eligibility purposes in any
Buyer Benefit Plan in which such Company Continuing Employees may be eligible
to participate after the Closing Date, (ii) for any Buyer Benefit Plans,
waive any pre-existing conditions or eligibility limits and give effect
to claims incurred, amounts paid by and amounts reimbursed to Employees prior
to the Closing for purposes of determining any deductible and maximum out-of-
pocket limits; _provided, however_ , such service shall not be recognized to
the extent that (x) such recognition would result in a duplication of
benefits or (y) such service was not recognized under the corresponding
Benefit Plan.

  



  

(c)  This Section 6.05 shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
Section 6.05, express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Section 6.05. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed
to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set
forth in this Section 6.05 shall not create any right in any Employee or any
other Person to any continued employment with the Company, Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever.

  



  

Section 6.06 Plant Closings and Mass Layoffs. Buyer shall not, and
shall cause the Company not to, take any action during the sixty (60) days
immediately following the Closing that could result in WARN Act liability.
Buyer shall be solely responsible for providing all notices required under the
WARN Act (or any similar applicable state or local laws) and for taking all
remedial measures including the payment of all liabilities and obligations if
such notices are not provided.

  



  

Section 6.07 Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and, in addition,
covenants and agrees to keep confidential, in accordance with the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement, information provided to Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement. From and after the Closing until the end of the Restricted
Period, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, hold, and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its or their respective
Representatives to hold, in confidence any and all information, whether
written or oral, concerning the Company, except to the extent that Seller can
show that such information is generally available to and known by the public
through no fault of Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives. If Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives are compelled to disclose any information by judicial or
administrative process or by other requirements of Law, Seller shall promptly
notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only that portion of such
information which Seller is advised by its counsel is legally required to be
disclosed, _provided that_ Buyer may, at Buyer's expense obtain an
appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded such information. If this Agreement is, for any
reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement and
the provisions of this Section 6.07 shall nonetheless continue in full force
and effect.

Section 6.08 Governmental Approvals and Other Third-party Consents

  



  

(a)  Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, use
reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all
consents, authorizations, orders and approvals from all Governmental
Authorities that may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the performance of its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement. Each party shall cooperate fully with the other party and its
Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all such consents, authorizations,
orders and approvals. The parties hereto shall not willfully take any action
that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of
any required consents, authorizations, orders and approvals. Within ten
Business Days after the date hereof, each party hereto agrees to make an
appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the date hereof and to supply as promptly
as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authority any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the
HSR Act; _provided, however_ , the payment of any fees in connection with the
foregoing shall be governed by Section 10.01 hereof.

  



  

(b)  Without limiting the generality of the undertakings
pursuant to Section 6.08(a), Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable best
efforts from the date hereof and until the Outside Date to secure all
necessary approvals from Governmental Authorities, including by defending
through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in
order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Governmental
Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the
consummation of the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 6.08 shall require, or be construed to require, Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to agree to: (i) sell, hold, divest, discontinue or limit, before
or after the Closing Date, any assets, businesses or interests of Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) any conditions relating
to, or changes or restrictions in, the operations of any such assets,
businesses or interests which, in either case of (i) or (ii), could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or materially
and adversely impact the economic or business benefits to Buyer of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iii) any material
modification or waiver of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 40| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c)  All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by
or on behalf of either party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or
regulators of any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any
interactions between Seller or the Company with Governmental Authorities in
the ordinary course of business, any disclosure which is not permitted by Law
or any disclosure containing confidential information) shall be disclosed to
the other party hereunder in advance of any filing, submission or attendance,
it being the intent that the parties will consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with any such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals; _provided, however_ ,
that each party may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other party
under this Section as "Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such counsel to other employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Seller or Buyer, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel, such permission not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each party shall promptly inform the other
party, and if in writing, furnish the other party with copies of (or, in the
case of oral communications, advise the other parties orally of) any
communication from or to any Governmental Authority regarding the
transactions contemplated hereunder. Each party shall give notice to the other
party with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or contact with any
Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental
Authority, with such notice being sufficient to provide the other party with
the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, discussion,
appearance or contact.

  



  

(d)  Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to give all notices to, and obtain all consents from, all third parties that
are described in Section 4.05 of the Seller Disclosure Letter or referred to
in Section 5.02 hereof;  _provided, however,_ that Seller shall not be
obligated to pay any consideration therefor to any third party from whom
consent or approval is requested. If any consent, approval or authorization
necessary to preserve any right or benefit under any Contract to which the
Company is a party is not obtained prior to the Closing, Seller shall,
subsequent to the Closing, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with Buyer at Buyer's expense and the Company in attempting to obtain such
consent, approval or authorization as promptly thereafter as practicable. If
such consent, approval or authorization cannot be obtained, Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Company with the rights and
benefits of the affected Contract for the term thereof, and, if Seller
provides such rights and benefits, the Company shall assume all obligations
and burdens thereunder.

Section 6.09 Books and Records.

  



  

(a)  In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made
against or incurred by Seller prior to the Closing, or for any other
reasonable purpose, for a period of seven years after the Closing, Buyer
shall:

  



  

(i)  retain the books and records (including personnel files)
of the Company relating to periods prior to the Closing in a
commercially reasonable manner; and

  



  

(ii)  upon reasonable notice, afford the Representatives of
Seller reasonable access (including the right to make, at Seller\'s expense,
copies), during normal business hours, to such books and records.

  



  

(b)  In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made by
or against or incurred by Buyer or the Company after the Closing, or for any
other reasonable purpose, for a period of seven years following the Closing,
Seller shall:

  



  

(i)  retain the books and records of Seller which relate to
the Company and its operations for periods prior to the Closing in a
commercially reasonable manner; and

  



  

(ii)  upon reasonable notice, afford the Representatives of Buyer
or the Company reasonable access (including the right to make, at Buyer\'s
expense, copies), during normal business hours, to such books and records.

  



  

(c)  Neither Buyer nor Seller shall be obligated to provide the
other party with access to any books or records (including personnel files)
pursuant to this Section 6.09 where such access would violate any Law, any
attorney/client privilege, or any confidentiality obligations of the
providing party.

  



  

Section 6.10 No Use of Seller Names.

  



  

(a)  Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that, subject to
subsections (b) and (c) below, nothing in this Agreement grants or shall be
deemed to grant to Buyer or its Affiliates the right to use or any interest in
the name "Airgas" or any trademark, trade name, service mark or other similar
mark or similar right which is a derivative of the name "Airgas"(in
logotype design or any other style or design) in whole or in part (the "
_Seller Names_ "). The prohibitions in this Section 6.10(a) shall apply to
any and all uses whatsoever of the Seller Names, including the use of the
Seller Names on any physical inventory, refrigerant cylinders, rolling stock,
motor vehicles, purchase order forms, packaging or other similar paper goods
or supplies, advertising and promotional materials, product, training and
service literature and materials, computer programs or like materials,
stationery, invoices, or identifying signs on any properties of the Company,
which identify or in any way make use of the Seller Names.

  



  

(b)  Except as necessary to comply with subsection (c) below or
as expressly permitted by this subsection (b), neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall use the Seller Names; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the
extent any Company assets as of the Closing Date contain Seller Names, Buyer
may, for a period of 90 days after the Closing Date, use such Seller Names;
_provided further_ , _however_ , in no event shall Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (i) use signs, stationery or purchase order forms bearing the
Seller Names, other than maintaining copies of such items as reasonably
necessary in the operation of the Company, at any time beyond the 90-day
period after the Closing Date or (ii) produce or reproduce any such items that
contain Seller Names.

  



  

   

 | 42| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c)  Within ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall change the corporate legal name of the Company to exclude the name
"Airgas" or any trademarks, trade names, service marks, domain names or
corporate or business names, derived from or including the words "Airgas."

  



  

(d)  The parties acknowledge and agree that the restrictions in
this Section 6.10 shall not apply to any disposable cylinders or similar
containers that contain Seller Names and nothing herein shall require Buyer to
take or cause to be taken any action, including de-inventorying for
repackaging, to remove any Seller Names from any such assets.

  



  

Section 6.11 Delivery of Audited Financial Statements. Seller shall
furnish Buyer at or prior to Closing (A) the audited consolidated balance
sheets of the Company as of March 31, 2015, March 31, 2016, and as of
December 31 in the calendar year 2016, and the related audited statements of
income and cash flows for the fiscal years then ended, and the notes and
schedules thereto required under Regulation S-X under the Securities Act
(together, the " _Acquired Company Audited Financial Statements_ "); and (B)
the unaudited consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of the end of any
quarterly period subsequent to December 31, 2016, to the extent the Closing
has not occurred prior to the 45th day after the end of such quarter, within
40 days of the end of such quarter, or if not available within 40 days
despite Seller's commercially reasonable efforts, as soon as practicable
thereafter, along with the corresponding financial statements for the same
period in the immediately prior fiscal year, and the related unaudited
statements of income and cash flows required under Regulation S-X under the
Securities Act, which shall have been reviewed by the independent accountants
of the Company as provided under SAS 100 (together, the " _Acquired Company
Unaudited Financial Statements_ ," and together with the Acquired Company
Audited Financial Statements, the " _Acquired Company Financial Statements_
"). Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to Buyer as
promptly as reasonably practicable (i) financial information related to the
Company reasonably requested in writing (including such requests made after
the provision of the Acquired Company Financial Statements) by Buyer as
promptly as reasonably practicable, which information is reasonably necessary
for Buyer to produce the pro forma financial statements required under
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act (together with the Acquired Company
Financial Statements, the " _Required Financial Information_ "), and (ii)
other information with respect to the Company reasonably requested by Buyer
in writing as promptly as reasonably practicable so that Buyer may satisfy its
applicable SEC requirements with respect to Exchange Act reporting and the
Required Financial Information. Such Acquired Company Financial Statements
shall not materially differ from the Financial Statements and, to the extent
of any such differences, Seller shall provide Buyer with a
reasonably detailed reconciliation of each such difference. Buyer and Seller
shall share equally the reasonable expenses of KPMG in connection with its
preparation of the Acquired Company Audited Financial Statements, except that
Buyer's portion of such expenses shall not exceed $300,000.00, provided Buyer
does not require a substantial change in the scope of the audit described in
this Agreement, in which case the $300,000.00 limit shall not apply.

Section 6.12 Closing Conditions. From the date hereof until the
Closing, each party hereto shall, and Seller shall cause the Company to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are necessary to
expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth in Article III hereof.

  



  

Section 6.13 Public Announcements. No party to this Agreement shall
make any public announcements in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise communicate with any news media
without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), and the parties shall
cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such announcement; _provided
however_ , to the extent any public announcements are otherwise required by
applicable Law or stock exchange requirements applicable to Buyer based upon
the reasonable advice of counsel, Buyer shall notify Seller, as soon as
reasonably possible, of such requirements (and the basis of the applicability
therefor) and reasonably cooperate with Seller regarding the timing, form and
content of any proposed public announcement.

  



  

Section 6.14 Non-Solicitation; Non-Competition.

  



  

(a)  For a period of two (2) years (in the case of all Company
Continuing Employees having a title of Manager or more senior) or one (1)
year (in the case of all other Company Continuing Employees) commencing on the
Closing Date, Seller shall not, nor shall it permit its Affiliates to,
directly or indirectly, hire or solicit for hire any Company Continuing
Employee, except pursuant to a general solicitation (including through the
use of recruiting or search firms) which is not directed specifically to
any such Company Continuing Employees; _provided, that_ nothing in this
Section 6.14 shall prevent Seller or any of its Affiliates from hiring or
soliciting for hire (i) any Company Continuing Employee whose employment has
been terminated by the Company or Buyer, or (ii) after ninety (90) days from
the date of termination of employment, any Company Continuing Employee
whose employment has been terminated by such Company Continuing Employee.

  



  

(b)  For a period of five (5) years commencing on the Closing
Date (the "Restricted Period"), Seller shall not, nor shall it permit any of
its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly (i) engage directly or indirectly in
the Restricted Business in the Territory, or (ii) have an ownership interest
in any Person that engages in the Restricted Business in the Territory in
any capacity, including as a partner, shareholder or member. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Seller and any of its Affiliates may, directly or indirectly
(A) own securities of any Person traded on any national securities exchange if
Seller or any of its Affiliates (as the case may be) is not a controlling
Person of, or a member of a group which controls, such Person and does not,
directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of any class of securities of such
Person, (B) engage in the provision of Excluded Services, and (C) engage in
the Restricted Business to the extent Seller or any of its Affiliate(s) are
deemed to engage in such activities by virtue of any business combination,
including a merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, lease, exchange,
mortgage, pledge, transfer or other acquisition (in one transaction or a
series of transactions) of any business in which the revenues of such acquired
business from engaging in the Restricted Business do not exceed the lesser of
(x) $5,000,000.00, or (y) 10% of such acquired business' revenues in the
latest financial statements made available to Seller or such Affiliate(s) at
the date of such business combination. In the event Seller or any of its
Affiliates acquires a business in which the revenues from engaging in the
Restricted Business exceed the foregoing dollar or percentage revenue
thresholds, Seller will (or will cause such Affiliate to), within 60 days from
completion of the acquisition, offer to sell the Restricted Business to Buyer
on substantially the same economic terms pursuant to which the Restricted
Business was acquired, or if such amount is not reasonably determinable, for
fair market value as reasonably determined by Seller. If Buyer declines to
provide written notice of its intent to purchase such Restricted Business
within 45 days of such offer, Seller will (or will cause its Affiliates to)
use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize, divest or discontinue
such Restricted Business, not later than six months following completion of
the acquisition, in such a manner that complies with the thresholds set forth
in clauses (x) and (y), above; _provided, however,_ that such obligation to
minimize, divest or discontinue shall cease on the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall be construed to
require Seller or any of its Affiliates to sell any portion of the acquired
business that does not constitute the Restricted Business.

  



  

   

 | 44| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c)  Seller agrees that a breach or threatened breach of this
Section 6.14 could give rise to irreparable harm to Buyer, for which monetary
damages might not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event
of a breach or a threatened breach by Seller of any such obligations, Buyer
shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be
available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to seek equitable
relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction,
specific performance and any other relief that may be available from a court
of competent jurisdiction (without any requirement to post bond).

  



  

(d)  Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this
Section 6.14 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests
of Buyer and constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
the event that any covenant contained in this Section 6.14 should ever
be adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic scope, product or service
scope, or other limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction,
then any court is expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such
covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law. The covenants contained in this Section 6.14 and
each provision hereof are severable and distinct covenants and provisions.
The invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as
written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants
or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or
provision in any other jurisdiction.

Section 6.15 Financing.

  



  

(a)  Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to be available at
Closing; _provided, however_ , that if funds in the amount set forth in the
Debt Financing Commitment become unavailable to Buyer on the terms
and conditions set forth therein, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such funds to the extent available on terms and conditions
materially no less favorable in the aggregate to Buyer (including the
conditions to the consummation of such financing) than as set forth in the
Debt Financing Commitment (the "Alternate Financing").

  



  

(b)  Upon request of Buyer, Seller shall, and shall cause the
Company to, provide reasonable cooperation and assistance to Buyer, at
Buyer's expense, in connection with the arrangement of the financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment or any Alternate Financing;
_provided, that_ in each case such requested cooperation and assistance does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operation of the business of the
Company.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in
this Agreement shall be construed to require Buyer, Buyer Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates to bring any claim, litigation or other legal
action against any of the Lenders or other financing sources in respect of
the Debt Financing.

  



  

Section 6.16 Data Room. Promptly following the Closing, Seller shall
(i) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Buyer two (2) writable media
copies of the Data Room (provided that Seller may redact any information
related to Seller or its other operations or any Employees whose employment
terminates at or before Closing) and (ii) terminate all access to the Data
Room.

  



  

Section 6.17 Filings. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall, and Seller shall cause the Company to, make all Filings with respect to
any completed reporting period which have not been made as of the date
hereof, in each case (i) to the extent the applicable governmental agency is
accepting the applicable Filing for the applicable completed reporting
period, and (ii) only if the applicable Filing is due within thirty (30) days
following the Closing (together with any customary extensions thereof, which
are consistent with past practice of the Company).

  



  

Section 6.18 Commercial Supply Agreement. At the Closing, Buyer and
Seller shall enter into a commercial supply agreement for a term of five years
pursuant to which Seller will purchase the Covered Products from Buyer
substantially on terms and conditions consistent with the principles set forth
in Section 6.18 of the Buyer Disclosure Letter (the " _Commercial Supply
Agreement_ "). Under the terms of the Commercial Supply Agreement, promptly
following the Closing, Seller shall, at Buyer's request, purchase from Buyer,
at a price per pound of $21.00, the greater of (x) any R-22 Inventory
delivered at the Closing in excess of 7,000,000 lbs. and (y) 200,000 lbs. of
R-22 Inventory delivered at the Closing (the " _Initial Purchase_ "). For a
period of two (2) years following the Closing, Buyer shall have the option
under the Commercial Supply Agreement to repurchase from Seller any or all
remaining R-22 Inventory contained in the Initial Purchase, at a price per
pound of $21.00.

Section 6.19 Release of Company from Intercompany Agreements. Prior to
the Closing, Seller shall release, or shall have caused the Company to be
released, from all obligations under any material agreements between the
Company, on the one hand, and the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than
the Company), on the other hand, and Seller shall have caused all
intercompany accounts payable (whether or not currently due or payable)
between the Company, on the one hand, and the Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Company), on the other hand, other than ordinary payroll or
other accounts receivable or payable which are included in the calculation of
Closing Working Capital, on the other hand, to be extinguished, eliminated,
removed or paid in full (without any premium or penalty).

reasonable best efforts to cause the Company to maintain at Closing no less
than 80% of the individual levels of HFC Inventory maintained as of May 31,
2017 in order to provide Buyer with the HFC Inventory necessary to supply
existing customers of the Company following Closing.

  



  

Section 6.21 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of the
parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute
and deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and
assurances, and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to
carry out the provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent there is equipment or
other items of tangible personal property that is located at any location
included in the Real Property or in the possession of any employee of the
Company but owned by the Seller or one of its Affiliates, such items shall
remain in the possession of the Company or such employee, as applicable, on
and after the Closing Date, and the Seller shall transfer (or cause the
transfer of, as applicable) ownership of such items to the Buyer as
necessary. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing items of tangible
personal property include computers, laptops, phone systems, cellular phones,
printers, scanners, copy machines, office equipment and furniture, vehicles,

Section 7.01 Survival. Subject to the limitations and other provisions
of this Agreement, the representations and warranties contained herein shall
survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until the date
that is twelve months from the Closing Date; _provided_ that the
representations and warranties in (a) Section 4.01, Section 4.02, Section
4.03, Section 4.04, Section 4.05(a), Section 4.18, Section 4.19(a)(i)

specified therein until performed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims
asserted in good faith with reasonable specificity (to the extent known at
such time) and in writing by notice from the non-breaching party to the
breaching party prior to the expiration date of the applicable
survival period shall not thereafter be barred by the expiration of such
survival period and such claims shall survive until finally resolved. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that the survival
period set forth in this Section 7.01 is a contractual statute of limitations
and any claim brought by any Party pursuant to this Article VII must be
brought or filed prior to the expiration of the survival period.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, claims for
misrepresentations and breach of warranties relating to employee benefits
matters (which are governed by Section 4.15), or tax matters (which are
governed by Article IX and Section 4.17) may be made until sixty (60) days
following the running of the applicable statute of limitations (giving effect
to any waiver or extension thereof).

 | 48| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(a) Except as to breach of any representation or warranty in
Section 4.14 hereof related to the properties identified as number
5 (Garland, TX) and number 7 (Pascagoula, MS) of Section 4.10(b) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, and except as to breach of any representation or
warranty in Section 4.14 hereof related to properties, other than those Real
Properties listed on Schedule 4.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, which
will not be owned or leased by the Company at the Closing, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for indemnification under
Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.03(a), as the case may be, until the aggregate
amount of all Losses in respect of indemnification under Section 7.02(a) or
Section 7.03(a) exceeds 1.0% of the Purchase Price (the " _Deductible_ "),
in which event the Indemnifying Party shall only be required to pay or be
liable for Losses in excess of the Deductible. With respect to any claim as
to which the Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification under
Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.03(a), as the case may be, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable for any individual or series of related Losses
which do not exceed $25,000.

  



  

(b)  Except as provided for in Section 7.04(j), the aggregate
amount of all Losses for which an Indemnifying Party shall be liable pursuant
to Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.03(a), as the case may be, shall not exceed
10% of the Purchase Price.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in
Section 7.04(a) and Section 7.04(b) shall not apply to Losses based upon,
arising out of, with respect to or by any reason of any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty of a Seller Fundamental
Representation, and in Section 4.17, Section 5.01, Section 5.02(a),
and Section 5.04. The aggregate amount of all Losses for which an
Indemnifying Party shall be liable pursuant to Section 7.02 or Section 7.03,
as the case may be, shall not exceed the Purchase Price.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in
Section 7.04(a), and Section 7.04(b) and Section 7.04(c) shall not apply to
Losses to the extent arising from Fraud, which Losses shall be uncapped.

  



  

(e)  Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 7.02
or Section 7.03 in respect of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any
liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance
proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by
the Indemnified Party (or the Company) in respect of any such claim, net of
any costs of such recovery or increased premiums with respect thereto. If the
Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies,
or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses, subsequent
to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party with respect to the
claims for which insurance proceeds were paid or amounts recovered from any
other Person, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such
Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment
up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party.

  



  

(f)  Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 7.02
or Section 7.03 in respect of any Loss shall be reduced by an amount equal to
any actual Tax benefit realized during the same Tax year in which the
indemnification payment was made as a result of such Loss by the Indemnified
Party in the year of such payment by the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

   

 | 49| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(g)  Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates
to take, all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any
event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise
thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to
remedy the breach that gives rise to such Loss.

  



  

(h)  No Losses may be claimed under Section 7.02 or Section 7.03
by any Indemnified Party to the extent such Losses are included in the
calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.02.

  



  

(i)  For purposes of this Article VII, the amount of Losses
shall be determined without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse
Effect or other similar qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to
such representation or warranty.

  



  

(j)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no Losses may be claimed under Section 7.02 in connection with any
claimed breach by Seller of any representation or warranty in Section 4.14
hereof that relates to any issue covered by the representations or warranties
in Section 4.14(c) or Section 4.14(e) hereof (including any Release of
Hazardous Materials or the presence of any attribute described in such
Section 4.14(e)) to the extent such claimed Losses or any issue giving rise
to such claimed Losses are identified or discovered as a result of any soil
and/or groundwater testing performed voluntarily by Buyer or its
Representatives, unless (i) such testing was required to be undertaken by
state or federal regulatory program requirements including state underground
storage tank laws, state brownfield and voluntary cleanup program laws; (ii)
such testing was required by Buyer's or Buyer's Affiliates' current, future
or proposed lenders, landlords, or prospective purchasers of all or portions
of the Real Property or the Company; (iii) such testing was necessary in
connection with the expansion or improvement or relocation of the Buyer's or
Buyer's Affiliates' owned or leased premises or the operations of the Buyer
or Buyer's Affiliates; (iv) such testing was necessary or required to comply
with applicable Environmental Laws; (v) such testing was expressly requested
by a Governmental Authority; or (vi) such testing was required by a
Governmental Order; and provided further, that with respect to clauses (i) -
(vi) of this Section 7.04(j), such Losses are incurred in order to comply
with Environmental Laws, Governmental Orders or applicable state or federal
environmental programs, including state underground storage tank programs and
state brownfield and voluntary cleanup programs. For purposes of this Section
7.04(j), except as set forth in clauses (i) - (vi) above, any soil or
groundwater testing that is not expressly required by applicable Environmental
Laws or formally ordered or requested by a Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over the Company (such order not to have been suggested or
solicited by Buyer or its Representatives) shall be deemed voluntary. In
addition to the other limitations contained in this Section 7.04, the
aggregate amount of Losses for which Seller may be liable as a result of a
breach or alleged breach of Section 4.14(c) or Section 4.14(e) shall not
exceed $6,000,000.

Section 7.05 Indemnification Procedures.

  



  

(a)  Third-Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives
notice of the assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other
legal proceeding made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this
Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a Representative of
the foregoing (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") against such Indemnified Party with
respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide
indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its indemnification obligations, except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party's rights or defenses are prejudiced by reason of such failure. Such
notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third-Party Claim in
reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable,
of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third-
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense and by the Indemnifying
Party\'s own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense; _provided that_ if the Indemnifying Party is Seller, such
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or direct the defense
of any such Third Party Claim that (x) is asserted directly by or on behalf of
a Person that is a supplier or customer of the Company, or (y) seeks an
injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, subject to Section 7.05(b), it shall have the right to take such
action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make
counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim in the name and on
behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right,
at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party
Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Party\'s right
to control the defense thereof; _provided_ , that if in the reasonable opinion
of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available
to the Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot
be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction for which
the Indemnified Party determines counsel is required. If the Indemnifying
Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim or fails to
promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as
provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, subject to Section
7.05(b), pay, compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim and seek
indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to
such Third-Party Claim. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in
all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third-
Party Claim, including making available (subject to the provisions of Section
6.07) records relating to such Third-Party Claim and furnishing, without
expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the
defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be
reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third-Party
Claim.

  



  

   

 | 51| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b)  Settlement of Third-Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into a
settlement of any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed), except as provided in this Section 7.05(b). If a
firm offer is made to settle a Third-Party Claim without leading to liability
or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the
Indemnified Party and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional
release of each Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in
connection with such Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to
accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written
notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails
to consent to such firm offer within ten days after its receipt of such
notice, the Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Third-
Party Claim and in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party
as to such Third-Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement
offer. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also
fails to assume defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may
settle the Third-Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to
settle such Third-Party Claim, with such non-material changes that may be
approved by the Indemnifying Party upon the advice of counsel. If the
Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 7.05(a), it
shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed).

  



  

(c)  Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account
of a Loss which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_
") shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party
prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice
shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party's rights or defenses are prejudiced by reason of such failure. Such
notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and
shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss
that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall have 45 days after its receipt of such notice to respond
in writing to such Direct Claim. During such 45-day period, the Indemnified
Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to
investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct
Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the
Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Party\'s
investigation by giving such information and assistance (including access to
the Company\'s premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any
accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its
professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does
not so respond within such 45-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall
be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified
Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.06 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All
indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the
parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

  



  

   

 | 52| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 7.07 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to the right to obtain
equitable relief and Section 6.14 and Section 10.11, the parties acknowledge
and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all
claims for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VII. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted
under Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action for any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth in
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, or otherwise relating to
the subject matter hereof or thereof, it may have against the other parties
hereto and their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives
arising under or based upon any Law, except pursuant to (x) the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VII and (y) the
provisions of Section 6.14 and Section 10.11.

  



  

Section 7.08 Payments. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying
Party or finally adjudicated to be payable and non-appealable pursuant to this
Article VII, the Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within five
(5) Business Days of such agreement or final, non-appealable adjudication by
wire transfer of immediately available funds.

  



  

Article VIII

Section 8.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing:

  



  

(a)  by the mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

  



  

(b)  by Buyer by written notice to Seller if:

  



  

(i)  Buyer is not then in material breach of any provision of
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents and there has been a
failure to perform any covenant made by Seller pursuant to Article VI of this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents that would, in the aggregate,
give rise to a Material Adverse Effect, and such breach, inaccuracy or failure
cannot reasonably be expected to be cured by Seller prior to 5:00 PM Eastern
Time on the six month anniversary of the date of this Agreement (as it may be
extended pursuant to Section 8.01(e) (the " _Outside Date_ "); or

  



  

   

 | 53| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii)  any of the conditions set forth in Section 3.01 or Section
3.02 shall not have been fulfilled by the Outside Date, unless such failure
shall be due to the failure of Buyer to perform or comply with any of the
covenants, agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with
by it prior to the Closing;

  



  

(c)  by Seller by written notice to Buyer if:

  



  

(i)  Seller is not then in material breach of any provision of
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents and there has been a
failure to perform any covenant made by Buyer pursuant to Article VI of this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents and such breach, inaccuracy or
failure cannot reasonably be expected to be cured by Buyer prior to or on the
Outside Date; or

  



  

(ii)  any of the conditions set forth in Section 3.01 or Section
3.03 shall not have been fulfilled by the Outside Date, unless such failure
shall be due to the failure of Seller to perform or comply with any of the
covenants, agreements or conditions hereof (but, for the avoidance of doubt,
not conditions that are the obligation of Buyer to satisfy, including the
condition in Section 3.02(k)) to be performed or complied with by it prior to
the Closing; or

  



  

(iii)  the (i) the conditions set forth in Section 3.01 and Section
3.02(a) through (j) have been satisfied (other than conditions which, by
their nature, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date), (ii) Seller has
confirmed by notice to Buyer that all conditions set forth in Section 3.03
have been satisfied (other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be
satisfied on the Closing Date) or that it is willing to waive any unsatisfied
conditions in Section 3.03 and (iii) the Closing has not been consummated by
the later of (x) the Outside Date and (y) three (3) Business Days after the
delivery of such notice; or

  



  

(d)  by Buyer or Seller in the event that:

  



  

(i)  there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise
prohibited; or

  



  

(ii)  any Governmental Authority shall have issued a Governmental
Order restraining or enjoining the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and such Governmental Order shall have become final and non-
appealable.

  



  

(e)  In the event that all of the conditions to Closing other
than (i) the conditions set forth in Section 3.01(a) or, solely with respect
to any Governmental Order relating to United States antitrust laws, Section
3.01(b) and (ii) those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied
at the Closing (and which are capable of being satisfied) shall have been
satisfied or waived, Buyer or Seller shall have the right to extend the
Outside Date for an additional three (3) months.

  



  

Section 8.02 Effect of Termination.

  



  

(a)  In the event of the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with this Article VIII, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto except:

  



  

(i)  this Article VIII and Losses to the extent arising from
either Section 6.07 or Article X hereof; and

  



  

(ii)  that nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from
liability for Losses arising from any Intentional Breach of any provision
hereof prior to such termination (including any failure by such party to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement if it is obligated
to do so hereunder). "Intentional Breach" means a breach that is a consequence
of an act undertaken or a failure to take an act by the breaching party with
the knowledge that the taking of such act or the failure to take such act
would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 54| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b)  In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Buyer or
Seller pursuant to (i) Section 8.01(b)(ii) or Section 8.01(c)(ii) due to the
failure to satisfy the conditions to Closing set forth in (w) Section 3.01(a),
(x) Section 3.01(b) (solely with respect to any Governmental Order relating
to United States antitrust laws), (y) Section 3.02(k) or (z) Section 3.03(b)
(with respect to a failure by Buyer to cause the condition in Section 3.02(k)
to be satisfied by the Outside Date), (ii) Section 8.01(c)(iii) or (iii)
Section 8.01(d) (solely with respect to any Law or Governmental Order
relating to United States antitrust laws), then Buyer shall pay to Seller in
immediately available funds, a termination fee in an amount equal to
$8,500,000.00 within five (5) Business Days following such termination (the "
_Buyer Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that that in no event shall
Buyer be required to pay the Buyer Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
if paid to Seller pursuant to this Section 8.02, the Buyer Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller or any of its Affiliates
against Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
stockholders, partners, members or Representatives for any and all Losses that
may be suffered based upon, resulting from or arising out of the
circumstances giving rise to such termination. If the Buyer Termination Fee
shall become due and payable in accordance with this Section 8.02, from and
after such termination and payment of such amounts in full pursuant to and in
accordance with this Section 8.02, the Buyer shall have no further liability
of any kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement or the
termination contemplated hereby. Each of the parties acknowledges that the
amounts payable in accordance with Section 8.02 are not intended to be a
penalty and shall constitute complete and reasonable liquidated damages for
any such breach.

  



  

(d)  In the event of the termination of this Agreement, none of
the Lenders or any other financing source in respect of the Debt Financing,
or any of their respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers affiliates,
employees, representatives, advisors, sub-advisors or agents shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_
, that subject to the rights of the parties to the Debt Financing Commitment
under the terms thereof, none of the parties hereto, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, solely in their respective capacities as parties to
this Agreement, shall have any rights or claims against any of the Lenders or
other financing source in respect of the Debt Financing in connection with
this Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitment, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise.

  



  

(e)  Each of Buyer and Seller acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.02 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the Seller would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Buyer fails to pay in a timely
manner any amount due pursuant to Section 8.02, then (i) Buyer shall reimburse
Seller for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable
fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including
in connection with any related claims, actions or proceedings commenced and
(ii) Buyer shall pay to Seller interest on such amount from and including the
date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual
payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made plus 2% per annum.

Seller will cooperate with each other to take all actions necessary and
appropriate (including filing such additional forms, returns, elections,
schedules and other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve a
timely election, in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 (or any comparable provisions of state or local tax law
or successor provisions) (the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ "). Prior to
Closing, Buyer and Seller shall agree on a schedule of the allocation of the
Purchase Price for all Tax purposes in a manner consistent with Section 1060
of the Code and the regulations thereunder (" _Purchase Price Allocation_ ").
At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver IRS Form 8883 (or successor form) with any
attachments, and any comparable forms required by provisions of state or
local law (collectively, items (i) and (ii) are referred to as the "
_Section 338(h)(10) Documents_ ") based on the agreed upon Purchase Price
Allocation. The Buyer and the Seller shall take no position on any Tax Return
that is inconsistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Documents. The Buyer shall
prepare any forms or schedules similar to IRS Form 8023 that are required for
provisions of state or local law that are comparable to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
9.03. The Seller shall execute and shall deliver to the Buyer such additional
documents or forms as are reasonably required to complete the 338(h)(10)
election upon at least thirty (30) days prior written notice from the Buyer.
In the event that IRS Form 8023 or IRS Form 8883 (or similar forms or
schedules required for provisions of state or local law) as filed is disputed
by any Tax authority, the party receiving written notice of the dispute shall
promptly notify the other party hereto concerning such dispute, and the
parties shall cooperate to defend the form or schedule as filed.

  



  

Section 9.02 Tax Treatment. The Tax year of the Company will end for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes on the Closing Date. The Buyer shall notify
Seller of any transaction that is properly allocable to the portion of the
day after the Closing that must be treated as occurring on the beginning of
the following day pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B), the Buyer shall pay such Tax attributable to
such transaction, and the Buyer shall report such transaction on its Tax
Returns. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that none of
the Buyer, the Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall
make a ratable allocation election under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(2) or any analogous provision of state, local or foreign Law.

Section 9.03 Tax Cooperation; Allocation of Taxes.

  



  

(a)  The following provisions shall govern the allocation of
responsibility as between the Company, the Buyer, and the Seller for certain
tax matters following the date hereof:

  



  

(i)  The Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
timely file or cause to be timely filed (taking into account all
extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed
by or with respect to the Company on a combined, consolidated, unitary, or
similar basis with Seller or any Affiliate thereof (other than the Company)
for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are required to
be filed after the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), and shall
timely pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns. Neither the Seller
nor the Company (prior to the Closing Date) shall file or cause to be filed
any amended Tax Return or claims for refund with respect to the Company
without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(ii)  The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely
file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns for the Company, for all Tax
periods which begin on or before the Closing Date and end after the Closing
Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "). The Buyer shall remit or cause to be remitted
any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns, provided that Seller shall pay
to the Company no later than five (5) days before the date on which such
Taxes are paid an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (determined in
accordance with this Section 9.03(a)(ii)). For purposes of this Section
9.03(a)(ii) and Article IX, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax
that relates to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall (1) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to
income, gains or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days from the beginning of such Straddle Period through the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Straddle Period, but Seller's liabilities for Taxes shall not be affected by
any change in circumstances that occurs or transactions that occur after the
Closing Date other than the 338(h)(10) Election, and (2) in the case of any
Tax based upon or related to income, gains or receipts, be deemed equal to
the amount of Tax which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on
the Closing Date. Any credits relating to a Straddle Period shall be taken
into account as though the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date.
Seller shall receive credit against its liabilities for Taxes for any such
Taxes paid by Seller with respect to any such Straddle Period or with respect
to Taxes that are included in the Closing Statement. For purposes of
clarity, in the event that Seller paid and/ or accrued on the Closing
Statement more than its share of liabilities for Taxes for such
Straddle Period pursuant to the foregoing, the Seller shall be reimbursed by
the Buyer in an amount equal to such overpayment. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be
made in a manner consistent with reasonable prior practice of the Company.

  



  

   

 | 57| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii)  For each Tax Return to which the provisions of Section
9.03(a)(i) or Section 9.03(a)(ii) applies, such Tax Return shall, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, be prepared in a manner consistent with
the past practices of the Company, and the party responsible for preparing or
causing to be prepared such Tax Return pursuant to such provisions (the "
_Preparing Party_ ") shall provide a copy of such Tax Return (in the case of
any consolidated return, a pro-forma Tax Return of the applicable Company
used in the preparation of the applicable consolidated return) to the other
Party (the " _Reviewing Party_ ") not later than thirty-five (35) days prior
to the due date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of such Tax
Return or as soon as practicable if the Tax Return due date is more than two
(2) months and fifteen (15) days from the end of the applicable period. The
Reviewing Party shall have the right to review and comment only on such
Straddle Period Tax Return prepared in accordance with Section 9.03(a)(ii)
prior to the filing of such Straddle Period Tax Return, and shall provide the
Preparing Party with written notice of any reasonable objections it has with
respect to such Straddle Period Tax Returns (a " _Tax Dispute_ ") within
fifteen (15) days of the delivery of such Tax Return. In the event that a Tax
Dispute notice is not timely delivered by any Reviewing Party, such party
shall be deemed to have consented to the filing of the applicable Straddle
Period Tax Return in the form provided to such Reviewing Party. In the event
of the timely delivery by any Reviewing Party of a Tax Dispute notice, the
parties shall in good faith attempt to resolve any such dispute for a period
of ten (10) days following the date on which the Preparing Party was notified
of the Tax Dispute in order to permit the timely filing of such Straddle
Period Tax Return. If such dispute is not settled within such time period,
the parties shall promptly submit all such remaining disputed matters to the
Independent Accountant for resolution in a timely manner so that such
Straddle Period Tax Return may be timely filed. If the Independent
Accountant is unable to make a determination with respect to any disputed
issue within five (5) Business Days before the due date
(including extensions) for the filing of the Straddle Period Tax Return in
question, then the Preparing Party may file such Straddle Period Tax Return
on the due date (including extensions) therefor without such determination
having been made and without the consent of the Reviewing Party; provided,
however, that such Straddle Period Tax Return shall incorporate such changes
as have at the time of such filing been agreed to by the parties pursuant to
this Section 9.03(a)(iii). Notwithstanding the filing of such Straddle Period
Tax Return, the Independent Accountant shall make a determination with respect
to any disputed issue, and such Straddle Period Tax Return shall be amended
to reflect the determination of the Independent Accountant to the extent such
determination is different from the basis on which such Straddle Period Tax
Return was so filed. The decision by the Independent Accountant shall be
final and binding on the parties. The fees and expenses relating to the
Independent Accountant pursuant to this Section 9.03(a)(iii) shall be borne
equally by Seller and Buyer.

  



  

(b)  Without the prior written consent of Seller, the Buyer
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, amend any Tax
Returns with respect to the Company relating to any pre-Closing Tax Period.
Any overpayments, refunds or credits of Taxes (plus interest) attributable to
any taxable period (or portion thereof, determined in accordance with Section
9.03(a)(ii)) of the Company that ends on or before the Closing Date shall be
for the account of Seller; provided however that Seller shall not be entitled
to any payment pursuant to the foregoing in respect of any refund of any Taxes
of the Company to the extent that such refund is reflected on the Closing
Statement or relates to or arises as a result of any carryback or other use
from any taxable period (or portion thereof, determined in accordance with
the provisions of Section 9.03(a)(ii)) beginning after the Closing Date of
any net operating loss, Tax credit or other Tax attribute. Buyer shall pay or
cause to be paid such amount to Seller less reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with obtaining such refunds. Seller shall repay to
Buyer the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 9.03(b) (plus any
penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Tax
Authority and any expenses incurred by Buyer) in the event and to the extent
that any Buyer is required to repay such refund to such Tax authority.

  



  

   

 | 58| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c)  Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished
to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to the Company as is reasonably necessary for the filing
of all Tax Returns, the preparation for any audit by any Governmental
Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding
relating to any Tax Return. Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate with each
other in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding related to Taxes
involving the Company and each shall execute and deliver such powers of
attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this
Section 9.03(c).

  



  

(d)  Seller shall cause all Tax allocation agreements and Tax
sharing agreements involving the Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any
of its Affiliates (other than the Company), on the other hand, to terminate as
of the Closing Date, and shall ensure that such agreements are of no further
force and effect as to the Company on and after the Closing Date and that
there shall be no present or future liabilities or obligations imposed on the
Company under any such agreements. All powers of attorney granted by or with
respect to the Company related to Taxes shall be terminated as of the Closing
Date.

  



  

(e)  All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration,
value added and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any real property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax)
(" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be paid by the Buyer when due. Buyer shall, at
its own expense, timely file any Tax Return or other document with respect to
such Taxes or fees (and Seller shall cooperate with respect thereto as
reasonably necessary).

  



  

(f)  The Seller shall pay all Taxes due with respect to any
original or amended consolidated or combined income Tax return that it may
file before or after the Closing. If after the date of this Agreement, Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company) files any amended Tax
Return or claim for any Tax Refund or takes any other action with respect to
any consolidated or combined returns, which has the effect of increasing the
Tax liability of the Company for any period ending after the Closing Date,
the Seller will reimburse the Company for the amount of the increase in Tax
liability incurred.
