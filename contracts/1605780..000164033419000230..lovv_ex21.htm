immediately after the Closing. The number of shares of Love Group Stock to be
received by each Shareholder is listed opposite such Shareholder's name on
_Annex A_ and is referred to herein as the " _Shares_ ".

contemplated hereby (the " _Transactions_ ") shall take place at the offices
of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter and Hampton LLP, New York, NY, commencing at 9:00

small capital to carry on its business for the current fiscal year as now

thereof, and (c) the current cash flow of Lovego Holdings, together with the
proceeds Lovego Holdings would receive, were it to liquidate all of its
assets, after taking into account all anticipated uses of the cash, would be
sufficient to pay all amounts on or in respect of its debt when such amounts
are required to be paid. Lovego Holdings does not intend to incur debts beyond

Effect.

waiver, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Love Group Material Adverse Effect.

applicable Laws, including those relating to occupational health and safety,

instances of noncompliance that, individually and in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Love Group Material Adverse
Effect. Love Group has not received any written communication during the past
two years from a Governmental Entity that alleges that Love Group is not in
compliance in any material respect with any applicable Law. Love Group is in
compliance with all effective requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, that are applicable to

Contracts that are material to the business, properties, assets, condition
(financial or otherwise), results of operations or prospects of Love Group
taken as a whole. Love Group is not in violation of or in default under (nor
does there exist any condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of
notice would cause such a violation of or default under) any Contract to which
it is a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound,
except for violations or defaults that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Love Group Material Adverse
Effect.



4.15. _Title to Properties_. Love Group has good title to, or valid leasehold
interests in, all of its properties and assets used in the conduct of its
businesses. All such assets and properties, other than assets and properties
in which Love Group has leasehold interests, are free and clear of all Liens,
except for Liens that, in the aggregate, do not and will not materially
interfere with the ability of Love Group to conduct business as currently
conducted. Love Group has complied in all material respects with the terms of
all material leases to which it is a party and under which it is in occupancy,
and all such leases are in full force and effect. Love Group enjoys peaceful
and undisturbed possession under all such material leases.



4.16. _Intellectual Property_. Love Group does not own, nor is validly
licensed nor otherwise has the right to use, any Intellectual Property Rights.

with regard to any Intellectual Property Right.



4.17. _Labor Matters_. There are no collective bargaining or other labor union
agreements to which Love Group is a party or by which it is bound. No material
labor dispute exists or, to the knowledge of Love Group, is imminent with

makers to continue as market makers of Love Group.

SEC Reports, none of the officers or directors of Love Group and, to the
knowledge of Love Group, none of the employees of Love Group is presently a
party to any transaction with Love Group or any subsidiary (other than for
services as employees, officers and directors), including any Contract or
other arrangement providing for the furnishing of services to or by, providing
for rental of real or personal property to or from, or otherwise requiring
payments to or from any officer, director or such employee or, to the
knowledge of Love Group, any entity in which any officer, director, or any
such employee has a substantial interest or is an officer, director, trustee
or partner.



4.20. _Internal Accounting Controls_. Love Group maintains a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that
(a) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or
specific authorizations, (b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability, (c) access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization, and (d) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with
the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken
with respect to any differences. Love Group has established disclosure
controls and procedures for Love Group and designed such disclosure controls
and procedures to ensure that material information relating to Love Group is
made known to the officers by others within those entities. Love Group's
officers have evaluated the effectiveness of Love Group's controls and
procedures. Since September 30, 2018, there have been no significant changes
in Love Group's internal controls or, to Love Group's knowledge, in other
factors that could significantly affect Love Group's internal controls.

4.21. _Solvency_. Based on the financial condition of Love Group as of the
Closing Date (and assuming that the Closing shall have occurred), (a) Love
Group's fair saleable value of its assets exceeds the amount that will be
required to be paid on or in respect of Love Group's existing debts and other
liabilities (including known contingent liabilities) as they mature, (b) Love
Group's assets do not constitute unreasonably small capital to carry on its
business for the current fiscal year as now conducted and as proposed to be
conducted, including its capital needs, taking into account the particular
capital requirements of the business conducted by Love Group, and projected
capital requirements and capital availability thereof, and (c) the current
cash flow of Love Group, together with the proceeds Love Group would receive,
were it to liquidate all of its assets, after taking into account all
anticipated uses of the cash, would be sufficient to pay all amounts on or in
respect of its debt when such amounts are required to be paid. Love Group does
not intend to incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature
(taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be payable on or in
respect of its debt).



4.22. _Application of Takeover Protections_. Love Group has taken all
necessary action, if any, in order to render inapplicable any control share
acquisition, business combination, poison pill (including any distribution
under a rights agreement) or other similar anti-takeover provision under the
Love Group's charter documents or the laws of its state of incorporation that
is or could become applicable to the Shareholders as a result of the
Shareholders and Love Group fulfilling their obligations or exercising their
rights under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the issuance of
the Shares and the Shareholder's ownership of the Shares.



4.23. _No Additional Agreements_. Love Group does not have any agreement or
understanding with the Shareholders with respect to the Transactions other
than as specified in this Agreement.

immediately following the Closing will not have become, an "investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

on its behalf has provided the Shareholders or their agents or counsel with
any information that Love Group believes constitutes material, non-public
information except insofar as the existence and terms of the proposed
transactions hereunder may constitute such information and except for
information that will be disclosed by Love Group under a current report on
Form 8-K filed within four business days after the Closing. Love Group
understands and confirms that the Shareholders will rely on the foregoing
representations and covenants in effecting transactions in securities of Love
Group. All disclosure provided to the Shareholders regarding Love Group, its
business and the Transactions, furnished by or on behalf of Love Group
(including Love Group's representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement) is true and correct and does not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.



4.26. _Certain Registration Matters_. Except as set forth in the Love Group
Disclosure Letter, Love Group has not granted or agreed to grant to any person
any rights (including "piggy-back" registration rights) to have any securities
of Love Group registered with the SEC or any other governmental authority that
have not been satisfied.



4.27. _Listing and Maintenance Requirements_. Love Group is, and has no reason
to believe that it will not in the foreseeable future continue to be, in
compliance with the listing and maintenance requirements for continued listing
of the Love Group Stock on the trading market on which the Love Group Stock

Agreement does not contravene the rules and regulations of the trading market

businesses, properties, prospects, operations or financial condition, that
would be required to be disclosed by Love Group under applicable securities
laws on a registration statement on Form S-1 filed with the SEC relating to an
issuance and sale by Love Group of its common stock and which has not been
publicly announced.



4.29. _Foreign Corrupt Practices_. Neither Love Group, nor to Love Group's
knowledge, any director, officer, agent, employee or other person acting on
behalf of Love Group has, in the course of its actions for, or on behalf of,
