dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute,

treated in a manner consistent with past practice and, if applicable, with
the December 30, 2000 Statement of Net Assets to be Sold, then, provided that

from being in accordance with GAAP, **** it must be accepted as correct by

Representatives, with reasonable access, during normal business hours and
without disruption to their day-to-day business, to their respective books,
records and facilities pertaining to the Bison Subsidiaries and the
Transactions to the extent affecting the Bison Subsidiaries, including any
consolidated or combined returns, schedules, consolidated or combined work
papers and other related documents; _provided_ , however, that with respect
to consolidated, combined, unitary or similar Tax Returns which include
Parent (or any Subsidiary of Parent, other than a Bison Subsidiary (a "Non-

existing on the Closing Date and $76,900,000, in a manner consistent with the
allocation methodology used in determining the allocation set forth in
Schedule D.

 

(b) Holdings may dispute any allocation set forth on the Adjustment
Schedule; provided, however, that (i) Holdings shall not dispute any of the
original allocations set forth in Schedule D and (ii) Holdings shall notify
Parent in writing (the "Allocation Dispute Notice") of each disputed
item, specifying the allocation in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable
detail, the basis for such dispute within 30 days of Holdings' receipt of
the schedule. Holdings shall submit only one Allocation Dispute Notice
containing all disputed allocations. In the event of such a dispute, Holdings
and Parent shall attempt to reconcile their differences and any resolution by
them as to any disputed allocations shall be final, binding and conclusive.
If Holdings and Parent are unable to reach a resolution with such effect
within 30 days of the receipt by Parent of the Allocation Dispute Notice,
Holdings and Parent shall submit the items remaining in dispute for
resolution to the Independent Accounting Firm which shall, within 30 days
after submission, determine and report to the parties upon such remaining
disputed allocations, and such report shall be final, binding and conclusive
on the parties hereto. All costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting
Firm relating to the disputed allocations shall be borne equally by Parent
and Holdings; provided, however, that if the Independent Accounting Firm
determines that the position asserted by one of the parties in such dispute
is substantially in error, then all such costs and expenses shall be borne by
the party so determined to be in error.

 

(c) Upon agreement of the parties with respect to the Adjustment Schedule,
or the completion of a report prepared by the Independent Accounting Firm
pursuant to Section 2.5(b), a schedule (the "Final Allocation
Schedule") setting forth the allocation among the Shares as specified in
Section 2.5(a) and modified pursuant to Section 2.5(b) shall be prepared by
the parties. Each of Holdings and Parent shall (i) timely file with each
relevant Tax Authority all forms and Tax Returns required to be filed in
connection with the allocation set forth in the Final Allocation Schedule,
(ii) be bound by such allocation for purposes of determining Taxes, (iii)
prepare and file, and cause their respective Affiliates to prepare and file,
their Tax Returns on a basis consistent with such allocation, and (iv) not
take any position, or cause their respective Affiliates to take any position,
inconsistent with such allocation on any Tax Return, in any audit or
proceeding before any Tax Authority or in any report made for Tax purposes;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.5 to the
contrary, (i) the parties shall be permitted to take a position inconsistent
with that set forth in this Section 2.5 if required to do so by a final and
unappealable decision, judgment, decree or other order by any court of
competent jurisdiction, and (ii) with respect to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent, Holdings or CandA; Products may pursue
a pre-filing agreement in accordance with Revenue Procedure 2001-22 (or any
successor pronouncement), and upon the request of the party pursuing a pre-
filing agreement the other parties shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) provide their reasonable cooperation and assistance in
obtaining any such pre-filing agreement.

2.8 _Earn-Out

 _ 

(a) If the aggregate EBITDA, as defined below, of Holdings for the
five fiscal years ending December 31, 2006 equals or exceeds two billion nine
hundred eight million dollars ($2,908,000,000), then CandA; Products and/or any
of its Subsidiaries shall pay Parent and/or designated Subsidiaries of Parent
the earn-out amount specified in Schedule G hereto (the "Earn-Out Amount").
Earn-Out Amounts between the fixed points including and in excess of three
billion two hundred ninety seven million dollars ($3,297,000,000) in the
column on Schedule G entitled "5-Year Cumulative EBITDA" shall be determined
by interpolation. The term "EBITDA" shall mean (i) the Consolidated
Cash Flow, minus Projected Time Adjusted Acquisition Cash Flow (excluding
any Consolidated Cash Flow attributable to any Receivables Financing
Subsidiary), provided that (A) the term "EBITDA" shall be substituted for the
term "Adjusted Consolidated Pro Forma Coverage Ratio" in the
applicable definitions, (B) the term "consolidated Subsidiary" shall
be substituted for the term "Restricted Subsidiary" in the
applicable definitions, (C) any net income or loss described in section (vi)
of the definition of Consolidated Net Income shall be included in the
calculation of Consolidated Net Income and (D) lease payments, or the
functional equivalent thereof (including payments of principal and interest
in connection with any synthetic lease arrangement or similar financing
arrangement), relating to the equipment initially subject to the transaction
described in Section 5.21 shall be added to Consolidated Cash Flow to the
extent such payments were deducted in computing Consolidated Net Income,
_plus_ (ii) to the extent that it is not included in the calculation of
Consolidated Cash Flow pursuant to (i), (x) the Consolidated Cash Flow minus
Projected Time Adjusted Acquisition Cash Flow, but substituting the term
"Textron Automotive Holdings Italy S.r.l." for the term "Company" and
deleting the term "Restricted Subsidiary" in all applicable definitions, and
(y) discounts and interest relating to factoring. (Capitalized terms in the
immediately preceding sentence shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the
Certificate of Designation.) All claims to Earn-Out Amounts are subordinate
to any amounts due under the financings described in the Debt Commitment
Letter.

  

>  
>

>>    

>>

>> (i) Within 120 days after the end of each of the five fiscal years ending 
on December 31, 2006, Holdings shall deliver to Parent audited financial 
statements of Holdings and its consolidated Subsidiaries, including a
balance  sheet as at the end of the applicable fiscal year and statements of
income and  cash flows for the respective twelve month period then ended. The
financial  statements shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by the
President and  the Chief Financial Officer of Holdings setting forth in
reasonable detail the  computation of EBITDA for the year then ended.
Holdings shall promptly give  Parent access to documents and other
information reasonably requested by  Parent for the purpose of assessing the
accuracy of the EBITDA calculation.

>>

>>  

>>

>> (ii) Within 60 days of any Asset Acquisition (as defined in the
Certificate  of Designation) occurring following the Closing Date and prior
to December 31,  2006, Holdings shall deliver a certificate of its Chief
Financial Officer to  Parent as to the related Certified Projections (as
defined in the Certificate  of Designation), prepared on the basis set forth
in the Certificate of  Designation, for the purpose of future calculations of
EBITDA as set forth  above.

>>

>>    

>
>  

  

(b) Parent may dispute the calculation of EBITDA (but not the
applicable Certified Projections) with respect to any year by delivering a
notice to Holdings within 45 days after receiving the EBITDA certification
specified above for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, which notice
shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for the dispute. If the parties
are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 days after delivery of the
aforesaid notice, the matter shall be submitted for resolution by the
Independent Accounting Firm which shall, within 30 days after submission,
determine and report to the parties upon the disputed items, and such report
shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. All costs and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Parent
and Holdings in the same proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of the
items unsuccessfully disputed by each party bears to the total dollar amount
of the items disputed under such notice. Subject to Section 2.8(e), any
amount payable to Parent shall be paid within five (5) business days
following the resolution of the dispute.

 

(c) Subject to Section 2.8(d) and completion of the dispute
resolution mechanism referred to in Section 2.8(b), the Earn-Out Amount shall
be paid on or before 180 days after delivery of the financial statements and
EBITDA certification specified in Section 2.8(a) for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2006. The Earn-Out Amount shall be paid in immediately available
funds by wire transfer to one or more accounts specified by Parent at least
two business days prior to the payment date.

 

(d) Holdings will use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate
debt covenants in instruments governing Indebtedness of Holdings and its
Subsidiaries that are customary for companies with its credit ratings and
credit statistics and the type of financing involved. In the event that
payment of the Earn-Out Amount would cause Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries to be in breach of any agreement or instrument governing
Indebtedness involving a principal amount, individually or in the aggregate,
of $5.0 million or more (a "Material Breach"), CandA; Products (or, in the
event the issuer of the other series of Preferred Stock is Holdings,
Holdings) will be permitted to issue shares of Series B Preferred Stock or,
if permitted by the terms of Section 1(c) of the Certificate of Designation,
another series of Preferred Stock with terms identical to the Series B
Preferred Stock, other than that (a) it may be optionally redeemed at any
time at a redemption price equal to its Liquidation Preference, plus any
accrued and unpaid dividends, (b) it must be mandatorily redeemed as set
forth below at a redemption price equal to its Liquidation Preference, plus
any accrued and unpaid dividends and (c) it must be convertible from time to
time at the option of the holder, in whole or in part, into shares of Series
B Preferred Stock, if such shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be
fungible with any outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock from a Tax
perspective, provided, that Preferred Stock will be issued only to the extent
necessary to avoid any such breach; _provided_ , _further_ ,  _however_ ,
that the terms requiring a mandatory redemption shall only be required to be
included in such Preferred Stock to the extent that doing so itself would not
cause a Material Breach. The Liquidation Preference and, if applicable,
related accrued and compounded dividends (all calculated as set forth in the
Certificate of Designation) of the shares of Preferred Stock issued in lieu
of payment of the Earn-Out Amount will be equal to that of the Earn-Out
Amount not paid in cash. Holdings and CandA; Products hereby agree that
following the issuance of any Preferred Stock in lieu of payment of the Earn-
Out Amount in cash, the issuer thereof is obligated, within 30 days following
any date upon which it would be permitted to redeem all or any portion of
such Preferred Stock without causing a Material Breach, to do so, whether in
one instance or as permitted from time to time.

 

(e) For purposes of computing the amount of consideration attributable to
the purchase of the Directly Purchased Subsidiaries under Section 2.5, the
present value of the Earn-Out Amount shall be thirty eight million
dollars ($38,000,000). Within 45 days of the payment of the Earn-Out Amount
by Holdings pursuant to this Section 2.8, Parent shall provide Holdings with
an accounting of the payment, for Tax purposes, setting forth the amount of
the payment that constitutes interest and the amount of the payment that
constitutes principal, computed in accordance with the principles of Section
483 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Holdings
may dispute any portion of the accounting. In the event of such a dispute,
Holdings and Parent shall attempt to reconcile their differences in
accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section
2.5(b). Each of Holdings and Parent shall (i) timely file with each relevant
Tax Authority all forms and Tax Returns required to be filed in connection
with such accounting, (ii) be bound by such filings, (iii) prepare and file,
and cause their respective Affiliates to prepare and file, their Tax Returns
on a basis consistent with such accounting and (iv) not take any position, or
cause their respective Affiliates to take any position, inconsistent with
such accounting on any Tax Return, in any audit or proceeding before any Tax
Authority or in any report made for Tax purposes, _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.8 to the contrary, the
parties shall be permitted to take a position inconsistent with that set
forth in this Section 2.8 if required to do so by a final and unappealable
decision, judgment, decree or other order by any court of
competent jurisdiction or Taxing Authority provided further however
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.8(e), if a party
reasonably expects that a failure to do so will subject that party to
penalties, that party is permitted to take positions inconsistent with that
set forth in this Section 2.8.

  

ARTICLE III 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
 OF PARENT

 



 



 

Parent represents and warrants to Holdings and CandA; Products, subject to the
exceptions set forth in the Disclosure Schedule (which exceptions
shall specifically identify a Section to which such exception relates, it
being understood and agreed that each such exception shall be deemed to be
disclosed both under such Section and any other Section to which such
disclosure on its face relates), that:

  

3.1 _Corporate Organization, Qualification, Power and Authority_.

 



 

(a) Parent and each of the Bison Subsidiaries is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (where applicable)
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. Each of the Bison
Subsidiaries is qualified and in good standing (where applicable) as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the properties owned, leased
or operated, or the business conducted, by it requires such qualification,
except where any failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Each of the Bison Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate
power and corporate authority and all necessary Permits to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where any failure to have such power and authority or
Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Parent has or will have made available to
Holdings prior to the Closing complete and correct copies of the articles of
organization or articles of or certificates of incorporation, as the case may
be, and by-laws or other equivalent organizational documents of it and each
Bison Subsidiary as in effect as of the date hereof.

 

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries have the requisite corporate power
and corporate authority to execute and deliver the Transaction Agreements (to
the extent each is a party thereto) and to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby. The Transaction Agreements and the consummation by
Parent and said Subsidiaries of the transactions contemplated thereby have
been duly and validly authorized by the Boards of Directors of Parent and
Textron Automotive Company Inc., and the general partner of Textron
Innovations L.P. (to the extent each is a party thereto), and no other
corporate proceeding on the part of Parent or its Subsidiaries is necessary
to authorize the Transaction Agreements or to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby. On the Closing Date, Parent and the Subsidiaries of
Parent will have the requisite corporate power and corporate authority to
execute and deliver the Italian JV Documents and the Leasing Documents (to
the extent each is a party thereto). This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Parent and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the
valid and binding agreement of Holdings and CandA; Products, constitutes the
valid and binding agreement of Parent, enforceable against Parent in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by (a)
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws now or hereinafter in effect relating to or
affecting creditors' rights generally and (b) general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law). When executed and delivered to Holdings and CandA; Products at the
Closing, the Transaction Agreements (other than this Agreement), the Italian
JV Documents and the Leasing Documents will be duly and validly executed and
delivered by Parent and its Subsidiaries (to the extent each is a party
thereto) and, assuming such agreements constitute the valid and binding
agreements of the other parties thereto, constitute the valid and binding
agreements of Parent and its Subsidiaries (to the extent each is a
party thereto), enforceable against Parent and said Subsidiaries, in
accordance with their terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by (a)
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws now or hereinafter in effect relating to or
affecting creditors' rights generally and (b) general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

  

3.2 _Stock of Subsidiaries

 _ 

.

 

(a) Schedule B to this Agreement identifies each entity that will be
a Subsidiary of the Directly Purchased Subsidiaries on the Closing Date. As
of the Closing Date, the Directly Purchased Subsidiaries will not own,
directly or indirectly, any equity interests in any other Person.

 

(b) All of the shares of capital stock of the Directly
Purchased Subsidiaries, except for any directors' qualifying shares, are
owned by Parent or one or more of its Subsidiaries free and clear of all
Liens (without regard to subsections (i) through (iv) of the proviso in the
definition of "Liens"), and have been duly authorized, validly issued and are
fully paid and nonassessable and were not issued in violation of any
preemptive or similar rights. Except for any director's qualifying shares and
except as otherwise set forth on Schedule B, all of the shares of capital
stock of the Subsidiaries listed on Schedule B will, as of the Closing Date,
be owned by one or more of the other Bison Subsidiaries as set forth on
Schedule B, free and clear of all Liens (without regard to subsections (i)
through (iv) of the proviso in the definition of "Liens"), and said shares,
together with the outstanding common stock of Textron Automotive Exteriors
Inc., have been duly authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable and were not issued in violation of any preemptive or similar
rights, except for any Liens or where any failure to be duly authorized,
validly issued and fully paid or nonassessable would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) There are no options, warrants, convertible securities or other
rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments relating to the capital stock
of, or other equity interest in, any Bison Subsidiary obligating Parent or
any Bison Subsidiary to issue, sell, transfer, vote or otherwise dispose of
or sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interest in, any
Bison Subsidiary or obligating Parent or any Bison Subsidiary to grant,
extend or enter into any such option, warrant, convertible security or other
right, agreement, arrangement or commitment. There are no voting trusts,
proxies or other voting agreements or understandings to which Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or they are bound with respect
to the shares of capital stock of any of the Bison Subsidiaries.

party are necessary in connection with the execution and delivery by Parent
and its Subsidiaries of the Transaction Agreements (to the extent each is a
party thereto) and the consummation by Parent and its Subsidiaries of the
transactions contemplated thereby. The notices, notifications, filings,
consents, authorizations, approvals, and expirations or terminations of
waiting periods referred in clauses 3.3(a)(i) and 3.3(a)(ii) are hereinafter
referred to as the "Requisite Regulatory Approvals."

 

(b) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of the
Transaction Agreements by Parent and its Subsidiaries nor the consummation by
Parent and its Subsidiaries of the transactions contemplated thereby does or
will (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any provisions of the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Parent or the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws or other equivalent organizational documents of any
of its Subsidiaries; (ii) conflict with, result in or constitute a Default
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of (A) any Contract to

Law applicable to (A) Parent or any of its properties or assets or (B) any of
Parent's Subsidiaries engaged in the conduct of the Business or any of their
properties or assets to the extent used in the conduct of the Business,
except, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this paragraph (b) for
conflicts or Defaults which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 _ 

. Parent has delivered to Holdings the following financial statements for
the Bison Subsidiaries (as adjusted to give effect to the
Restructuring) (collectively, the "Financial Statements"): a statement of net

3.9 _Employee Benefit Plans and Agreements

 _ 

.

 

(a) A "Bison Plan" shall mean any (i) "welfare" plan, fund or program (within
the meaning of Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and any comparable foreign plan; (ii) "pension"
plan, fund or program (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) and any
comparable foreign plan; (iii) deferred compensation plan or incentive
compensation plan; (iv) employment, termination or severance agreement with
any officer of a Directly Purchased Subsidiary whose principal office is
located in the United States other than officers who are employed by a Non-
Bison Subsidiary; (v) stock bonus, stock option, restricted stock, stock
appreciation right, stock purchase, bonus, severance or vacation plans; and
(vi) any other material employee benefit plans, funds or programs, in each
case, that are sponsored or maintained by or contributed to or required to be
contributed to by a Bison Subsidiary or by any trade or business, whether or
not incorporated (an "ERISA Affiliate"), that together with a Bison
Subsidiary would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section
4001(b) of ERISA or to which a Bison Subsidiary or an ERISA Affiliate is
party, for the benefit of any employee or former employee of a Bison
Subsidiary (or of Textron Automotive Company Inc. if such person's entire
salary was directly charged to the Business), or with respect to which
a Bison Subsidiary could incur liability and any comparable foreign plan.
Section 3.9 of the Disclosure Schedule lists each material Bison Plan
applicable to any Bison Subsidiary having its jurisdiction of organization
within the United States and all foreign pension plans. A copy of each
material Bison Plan (and, if applicable, related amendments, trust
agreements, current summary plan descriptions, most recent Form 5500, most
recent Internal Revenue Service determination letter and most recent
actuarial report) applicable solely to any Bison Subsidiary having its
jurisdiction of organization within the United States has been made available
to Holdings, and a copy of each material Bison Plan from which assets will be
transferred from Parent to CandA; Products pursuant to Section 5.7 will be made
available to Holdings prior to Closing.

 

(b) No liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred
by any Bison Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in
full, and, to Parent's knowledge, no condition exists that presents a
material risk to a Bison Subsidiary of incurring any such liability, other
than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
(which premiums have been paid when due).

 

(c) Each Bison Plan (other than a Foreign Plan) has been operated
and administered in accordance with its terms and with the requirements
(including funding requirements) of applicable Law, including ERISA and the
Code, except where any failure to be so operated and administered would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect. All material contributions required to be made under the
terms of any Bison Plan (other than a Foreign Plan) as of the Closing Date
have been made or will be timely made on or prior to the Closing Date. With
respect to any Bison Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302
of ERISA, there has been no application for or waiver of the minimum funding
standards imposed by Section 412 of the Code, and no such plan has incurred
an "accumulated funding deficiency" within the meaning of Section 412(a) of
the Code as of the end of the most recently completed plan year.

 

(d) Each Bison Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service stating that it is so qualified, and no event has occurred
since the date of such determination that would adversely affect
such determination or result in the imposition of any material liability,
penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code.

 

(e) The consummation of the Transactions will not (i) entitle any employee
of any Bison Subsidiary to severance pay payable by a Bison Subsidiary,
(ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any
other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Bison Plans, (iii) result
in any material Default under, any of the Bison Plans or (iv) result in or
satisfy a condition to the payment of compensation that would, in combination
with any other payment, result in an "excess parachute payment" with respect
to any Employee within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code.

 

(f) With respect to any Bison Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, there is
not any amount of "unfunded benefit liabilities" (as defined in
Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA) under such plan, and the Parent is not aware of
any facts or circumstances that would materially change the funded status of
any such plan.

 

(g) No Bison Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has liability (including
any contingent liability under Section 4204 of ERISA) with respect to
any multiemployer plan, within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA.

 

(h) There are (i) to Parent's knowledge, no investigations pending by any
governmental entity (including the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation) involving Bison Plans, and (ii) no pending or, to Parent's
knowledge, threatened claims (other than routine claims for benefits), suits
or proceedings against any Bison Plans, or against any fiduciary of any Bison
Plan which would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(i) None of the Bison Subsidiaries or any employee of the foregoing, nor
any trustee or administrator with respect to the Bison Plans, has engaged in
a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 406 of ERISA) that could result in a tax or penalty
under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA which would,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(j) Since January 1, 2000, the Bison Subsidiaries, and any ERISA
Affiliates which maintain a "group health plan" within the meaning of
Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code have complied in all material respects with
the "COBRA" notice and continuation requirements.

 

(k) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Bison Plan subject
to ERISA that is an employee pension benefit plan and is not qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code is exempt from Part 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA
as an unfunded plan that is maintained primarily for the purpose of providing
deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees, pursuant to Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.

 

(l) Each Foreign Plan has been operated and administered in accordance
with its terms and with the requirements of applicable Law, except where any
failure to be so operated and administered would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. All
material contributions required to be made under the terms of any Foreign
Plan as of the Closing Date have been made or will be timely made on or prior
to the Closing Date, and no Bison Subsidiary has incurred any unpaid
obligation in connection with the termination or withdrawal from any Foreign
Plan. With respect to any unfunded retirement plan which is a Foreign Plan
for which GAAP or applicable Law requires that reserves be recorded on a
statement of financial position, reserves have been recorded on the December
30, 2000 Statement of Net Assets to be Sold in a manner which is consistent
with GAAP and applicable Law. With respect to funded retirement plans which
are Foreign Plans, the plans have been funded in accordance with applicable
Law. Copies of the most recent actuarial valuation reports or FAS 87 reports
for Foreign Plans, to the extent that they exist, have been made available to
Holdings. There are no actions, suits or claims (other than routine claims
for benefits) pending or threatened with respect to any Foreign Plan that
would, individually, or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. For purposes hereof, the term "Foreign Plan" shall
mean any Bison Plan maintained or contributed to primarily for the benefit of
any employee or former employee of a Bison Subsidiary employed outside the
United States.

 

(m) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Section 3.4
and this Section 3.9 set forth the sole representations and warranties in
Article III of this Agreement with respect to the compliance by Parent and
any Bison Subsidiary with ERISA, sections of the Code and any other Law
applicable to the operation or administration of any Bison Plan.

through and including the date hereof, no Bison Subsidiary has been affected
by any transaction or engaged in lay-offs or employment terminations
sufficient in number to trigger the application of any Law similar to the
WARN Act.

5.7 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Employment Status_. CandA; Products or one of its Subsidiaries shall
continue to employ all of the Employees who are actively employed by a Bison
Subsidiary on the Closing Date (each such employee being hereafter referred
to as a "Transferred Employee"), it being agreed that persons who are on lay-
off or leave and who have a right to return to work at a Bison Subsidiary or
who are on short-term (not more than six months) medical disability
(including pregnancy leave) who do not thereafter become eligible for long-
term medical disability, or other authorized leave (such as military, family
or other leaves where return to work is subject to statutory requirements)
are to be considered Employees who are actively employed but that persons on
long-term medical disability or whose short-term medical disability
thereafter becomes a long-term medical disability and persons whose
employment has terminated or will terminate prior to the Closing Date without
any right to return to work are not to be considered Employees who are
actively employed; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of this
Section 5.7(a) shall not be construed to limit the ability of CandA; Products
to terminate any such Employee at any time for any reason. For the purposes
of this Agreement the terms "layoff", "right to return to work", "short-term
disability", "long-term disability" and "pregnancy leave" shall be construed
in accordance with the personnel policies of the Bison Subsidiaries and the
collective bargaining agreements covering Employees as of the Closing Date,
if applicable.

(including fringe benefits and severance pay) that will provide benefits and 
compensation to the Transferred Employees that are for a period of at least 
one year after the Closing Date (or such longer period as may be required by 
applicable Law) substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided 
by Bison Subsidiaries to the Transferred Employees immediately prior to the 
Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this 
Agreement, CandA; Products shall not terminate any Stand-Alone  Pension Plan
assumed pursuant to Section 5.7(c)(i) or any pension plan into  which Parent

plan in which any Transferred Employee participates, for purposes of 
determining eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits, 
including severance benefits and vacation entitlement (but not accrual of 
pension benefits), service with the Bison Subsidiaries (or predecessor 
employers to the extent the Bison Subsidiaries provided past service credit) 
shall be treated as service with CandA; Products; _provided_ , _however_ , 
that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such 
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Such service shall 
also apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of 
insurability requirements or the application of any pre-existing  condition
limitations. Each such plan shall waive pre-existing  condition limitations
to the same extent waived under the applicable plan of  the Bison Subsidiary.
Transferred Employees shall be given credit under the  applicable plan of
Holdings or any Affiliate thereof for amounts paid under  a corresponding
benefit plan during the same period for purposes of applying  deductibles,
co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums  as though such amounts had been paid
in accordance with the terms and  conditions of the successor or replacement
plan.

>> (ii) CandA; Products shall establish, or shall amend one of its existing 
pension plans, as of the Closing Date, or as soon as practicable after the

("Parent's Salaried Pension  Benefit"). Parent will cause each Transferred
Employee participating in  the Parent's Salaried Pension Benefit to be fully
vested in his/her  benefits under the Parent's Salaried Pension Benefit as of
the day  immediately preceding the Closing Date. Subject to the transfer of
assets  described in Section 5.7(c)(iv), CandA; Products' Salaried Pension 
Plan shall assume the liabilities as of the Closing Date for the benefits of 
all Employees and Former Employees participating in the Parent's  Salaried
Pension Benefit. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section  5.7(b)(i), the
CandA; Products' Salaried Pension Plan may at any  time be a cash balance
pension plan.

>>

>>  

>>

>> (iii) CandA; Products shall establish, or shall amend one of its  existing
pension plans as of the Closing Date, or as soon as practicable  after the
Closing Date, to include a tax-qualified defined benefit  plan ("CandA;

participating in the Parent's Hourly Master Pension Benefit. Subject  to
applicable collective bargaining agreements and notwithstanding the 
provisions of Section 5.7(b)(i), the CandA; Products' Hourly  Pension Plan may
at any time be a cash balance pension plan.

>>

>>  

>>

>> (iv) On a day which is within 60 days after the later of (i) the date 
upon which CandA; Products delivers to the Parent notice that CandA;  Products'
actuaries, pursuant to Section 5.7(c)(vii) of this  Agreement, have reviewed
the calculations of Parent's actuaries and  are satisfied that such
calculations are in accordance with this Agreement,  or (ii) the day upon
which CandA; Products delivers to Parent a favorable  Internal Revenue Service
determination letter or an opinion, reasonably  satisfactory to Parent's
counsel, of CandA; Products'  counsel to the effect that the terms of CandA;
Products' Salaried  Pension Plan and CandA; Products' Hourly Pension Plan and
their  related trusts qualify, as to form, under Section 401(a) and Section
501(a)  of the Code, Parent shall cause the trustee under the Parent's 
Salaried Pension Benefit and Parent's Hourly Master Pension Benefit 
("Parent's Trustee") to transfer to the trustee of CandA;  Products' Salaried
Pension Plan and CandA; Products' Hourly  Pension Plan ("CandA; Products'
Trustee") cash assets in  an amount equal to the amount computed pursuant to
the following paragraph,  but not less than the amount necessary to satisfy
the applicable  requirements of Section 414(1) and 401(a)(12) of the Code.

>>

>>  

>>

>> (v) The assets to be transferred from Parent's Trustee to CandA;  Products'
Trustee shall be cash only and shall equal 110% of the  projected benefit
obligation as of the Closing Date of the Employees and  Former Employees
under Parent's Salaried Pension Benefit and  Parent's Hourly Master Pension
Benefit. The calculation of 110% of  the projected benefit obligation will be
calculated using the actual census  information as of the Closing Date and by
applying (i) a discount rate  calculated pursuant to the methodologies
utilized in Parent's  December 31, 2000 audit disclosure prepared for purpose
of Statement of  Financial Accounting Standards Number 87 published by the
FASB ("FAS  87") and (ii) other actuarial assumptions, methods and
methodologies  utilized in Parent's FAS 87 audit disclosure, each set forth
in  Section 5.7(c)(vii) of the Disclosure Schedule.

>>

>>  

>>

>> (vi) The amount transferred pursuant to Section 5.7(c)(iv) shall be 
adjusted for investment earnings or losses of the trust in which Textron 
Master Retirement Plan assets are held for the period between the Closing 
Date and the actual date of transfer and reduced by the amount of any 
benefit payments from such plan to Employees and Former Employees during 
such period and a proportionate share of administrative expenses for such 
period if such administrative expenses are properly chargeable (and are 
actually charged) to the Parent's Salaried Pension Benefit or  Parent's
Hourly Master Pension Benefit. Parent shall estimate such  earnings as of the
actual date of transfer and then within 90 days of the  actual date of
transfer, Parent shall cause Parent's trust to remit  to CandA; Products' trust
or CandA; Products shall cause CandA;  Products' trust to remit to Parent's
trust, as appropriate,  an amount equal to the difference between the actual
rate of earnings for  such period and the estimated amount transferred as of
the actual date of  transfer (such difference to be adjusted for investment
earnings at the  State Street Bank short-term rate for the period between the
actual  date of transfer and the date such difference is paid to Parent or
CandA;  Products). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.7(c) to the
contrary,  following the Closing Date and until the date of the respective
transfers of  assets to trusts under CandA; Products' pension plans, Parent
shall  cause the trusts under the pension plans of Parent or an Affiliate
covered  by this Section 5.7(c) to continue to provide benefits to plan
participants  in accordance with the terms of the applicable pension plan to
the extent  that such benefits have accrued on or before the Closing Date. To
the extent  that benefits have accrued after the Closing Date, following the
transfer of  assets pursuant to Section 5.7(c)(iv), CandA; Products shall pay
such  benefits to plan participants (retroactively, if applicable) in
accordance  with the terms of the applicable pension plan.

>>

>>  

>>

>> (vii) The assets caused to be transferred pursuant to Section 5.7(c) 
shall be calculated by Parent's actuary, and shall be subject to  review by
CandA; Products' actuary for the purpose of confirming  that the calculation
was made in accordance with (i) the actuarial  assumptions and methods set
forth in this Section 5.7(c) and in Section  5.7(c)(vii) of the Disclosure
Schedule and (ii) generally accepted actuarial  practice. As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, Parent shall  provide CandA; Products with
a detailed summary of the calculations  described in this Section 5.7(c) and
any back-up data reasonably  requested by CandA; Products. If CandA; Products or
CandA;  Products' actuary does not notify Parent to the contrary within 60 
days after the delivery to CandA; Products of such detailed summary and  data,
the calculations of Parent's actuary pursuant to this Section  5.7(c) shall
be deemed to be final, conclusive and binding on the parties.  If, however,
CandA; Products notifies Parent in writing within such period  that it and its
actuaries believe that the calculations were not prepared in  accordance with
the requirements of this Section 5.7(c) and such notice  specifies (i) the
precise items of the calculations challenged, (ii) the  basis of the
challenge and (iii) the amount of the adjustment they propose  with respect
to each such item, the parties will then attempt to resolve  their
differences with respect thereto. CandA; Products shall only be  entitled to
dispute any individual item that involves a proposed adjustment  of more than
$25,000 or items collectively aggregating $100,000 or more. If  the parties
are unable to resolve their dispute within 30 days after the  date CandA;
Products notifies Parent of the disputed items, the disputed  items shall be
referred to an international benefits consulting firm (the  "Actuary Firm")
mutually acceptable to CandA; Products and  Parent. The Actuary Firm shall be
asked to resolve such disputes and report  to Parent and CandA; Products upon
such remaining disputed items within 45  days after such referral. The
decision of the Actuary Firm shall be final,  conclusive and binding on the
parties hereto. The fees and expenses of the  Actuary Firm in conducting this
assignment shall be borne equally by Parent  and CandA; Products.

Service determination letter regarding a defined contribution plan of CandA;
Products (the "CandA; Products' Savings Plan") or an opinion, reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, of CandA; Products' counsel to the effect that the
terms of the CandA; Products' Savings Plan and its related trust qualify, as to
form, under section 401(a) and Section 501(a) of the Code, Parent shall cause
the trustee of the Textron Savings Plan to transfer all of the assets and
liabilities thereof attributable to Transferred Employees to the CandA;
Products' Savings Plan. The assets to be transferred shall be cash,
promissory notes for loans made to Transferred Employees under the terms of
the Textron Savings Plan and Parent common stock held in the accounts of the
Transferred Employees. The CandA; Products' Savings Plan shall continue to
provide Parent common stock as an investment alternative for Transferred
Employees for at least three years after the Closing Date. Such Parent common
stock investment alternative shall only be available to Transferred Employees
who have Parent common stock transferred from their account in the Textron
Savings Plan to their account in the CandA; Products' Savings Plan and only to
the extent of the Parent common stock so transferred. No new contributions or
intraplan transfers will be allowed into the Parent common stock investment

>>

>>  

>>

>> (ii) In determining Parent's liability for Taxes pursuant to this 
Agreement, Parent shall be credited with the amount of estimated Taxes paid 
by or on behalf of any of the Bison Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. To 
the extent that Parent's liability for Taxes for a taxable year or  period is
less than the amount of estimated income Taxes previously paid by  or on
behalf of any of the Bison Subsidiaries (other than THI and its 
Subsidiaries) with respect to all or a portion of such taxable year or 
period, Holdings shall pay Parent the difference within two days of filing

thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the account of 
Parent, and Holdings shall pay over to Parent any such refund or the amount 
of any such credit within 15 days after receipt of such credit or 
entitlement thereto.

(A) 56.6% or (B) the percentage of issued and outstanding stock of  Plascar
held by Permali, of any Tax refund (including any interest in  respect
thereof) received by Plascar or TATB or any amounts credited against  Tax to
which Plascar or TATB becomes entitled (including by way of any  amended Tax
Returns or any carryback filing), that relate to any taxable  period, or
portion thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date shall be  for the
account of Parent, and Holdings shall pay over to Parent the  Ownership
Percentage of any such refund or credit within 15 days after  receipt of such
credit or entitlement thereto.

>>  

>>

>> (iv) Holdings shall pay Parent interest at the rate prescribed under 
Section 6621(a)(1) of the Code, compounded daily, on any amount not paid 
when due under this Section 5.8(c). For purposes of this Section 5.8(c),

Date on the basis of an interim closing of the books of each of the Bison

that Parent reasonably believes is available based on  substantial authority,
including through filing appropriate forms with the  applicable Tax
Authority; _provided_ , that if the refund would result  in any Tax Detriment

their Affiliates) to take, any action, with respect to the taxable year or 
period of Holdings, CandA; Products, such Bison Subsidiary, or Affiliate,  as
applicable, which includes the Closing Date, which would be reasonably 
likely to increase Parent's or any Non-Bison Subsidiaries  (or any of their
Affiliates) liability for Taxes (including any liability of  Parent to
indemnify Holdings for Taxes pursuant to this Agreement)  including, for
example, any action which would be reasonably likely to,  result in, or
change the character of, any income or gain (including any  Subpart F income)
that Parent or any Non-Bison Subsidiary (or any of  their Affiliates) must
report on any Tax Return.

>>

>>  

>>

>> (ii) None of Holdings or any Affiliate of Holdings (including CandA; 
Products) shall (or shall cause or permit any of the Bison Subsidiaries 
(other than THI and its Subsidiaries) to) amend, refile or otherwise modify 
any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to any of the Bison Subsidiaries 
with respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing 
Date (or with respect to any Straddle Period) without the prior written 
consent of Parent, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of 
Parent.

>>

>>  

>>

>> (iii) Except to the extent otherwise required by Law, none of Holdings or 
any Affiliate of Holdings (including CandA; Products) shall (or shall cause  or
permit any of the Bison Subsidiaries (other than THI and its  Subsidiaries)
to) carryback for federal, state, local or foreign tax  purposes to any

than THI and its Subsidiaries) or Parent or any  Affiliate of Parent ending
before, or which includes, the Closing Date any  operating losses, net
operating losses, capital losses, tax credits or  similar items arising in,
resulting from, or generated in connection with a  taxable year of Holdings

Holdings shall, (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to),
provide information to the other party regarding any of the Bison
Subsidiaries or the Business in connection with (i) the other party preparing
any Tax Returns which such other party is responsible for preparing and
filing, and (ii) the other party preparing for any audits of, or disputes
with any Tax Authority regarding, any Tax Returns of any of the Bison
Subsidiaries. In connection therewith, Holdings, CandA; Products and Parent
shall not dispose of any Tax work papers, books or records relating to any of
the Bison Subsidiaries during the six-year period following the Closing Date,
and thereafter shall give the other parties reasonable written notice before
disposing of such items.

 

(g) _Section 338(g) Elections_. Holdings shall ensure that CandA; Products does
not make any election under Section 338(g) of the Code (or any analogous
provision of state, local, or foreign law) with respect to the purchase of

of Parent, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of Parent. If
Parent does so consent, Holdings and CandA; Products shall jointly and
severally be liable for, and shall pay, any Tax attributable to, or resulting
from, the making of such election and will indemnify Parent from and against
any Tax liability or other adverse consequences attributable to, or resulting

option to acquire Parent stock held by employees of any Bison Subsidiary. If,
however, all or any part of a Tax deduction claimed by Parent with respect to
the exercise of an option to acquire Parent stock held by employees of
any Bison Subsidiary is disallowed to Parent, then, to the extent permitted
by law, Holdings, CandA; Products or a Bison Subsidiary (or their
appropriate Affiliate) shall claim such Tax deduction. If Holdings, CandA;
Products or a Bison Subsidiary (or any of their Affiliates) receives any Tax
Benefit in any taxable period as a result of any Tax deduction claimed by
Holdings, CandA; Products or a Bison Subsidiary (other than THI and its
Subsidiaries) (or any of their Affiliates) pursuant to this Section 5.8(h),

Indemnitor"). Such notice shall contain factual information  describing any
asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include  copies of any
notice or other document received from any Tax Authority in  respect of any

 _ 

.

 

(a) Prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the Parent
Entities shall not engage in the business of (i) manufacturing or selling
overhead systems, headliners, interior instrument panels, interior quarter
panel/sidewall trim, interior trim consoles, lift-gate trim panels, painted
or unpainted fascia and bumpers, claddings/exterior trim moldings,
exterior grilles, structural composite bumpers, or signal, taillight and
other lighting or (ii) assembling or selling cockpit systems or front-end
modules, in each case as currently manufactured, assembled or sold by the
Bison Subsidiaries and in each case for use in automotive passenger cars and
light and heavy trucks (the "Restricted Field"). For the avoidance of doubt,
the continued operation of the existing businesses of Parent and the Non-
Bison Subsidiaries and the continued ownership by Parent or one or more of
its Affiliates of a direct or indirect equity interest in THI and its
Subsidiaries shall not be a violation of this Section 5.11(a).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if CandA; Products
or any of its Subsidiaries default under any of the Leasing Documents and
Parent or any of its Affiliates continue to own any interest in the Equipment
(as defined in the Equipment Lease Term Sheet attached hereto as Exhibit 12)
subject thereto, then the Parent Entities (and all Affiliates of Parent)
shall be permitted to use such Equipment (whether or not in the Restricted
Field) and lease, license, sell or otherwise transfer (whether or not for use
in the Restricted Field) all or any part of their respective right, title and
interest in and to such Equipment to any third party.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Entities may acquire,
directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of the capital stock or
assets of any Person (an "After-Acquired Business") which derives 33%
or less of its gross sales revenues from the Restricted Field, if Parent or
such Parent Entity promptly grants to Holdings an option to acquire the
portion of the After-Acquired Business which engages in the Restricted Field
(the "Restricted Portion") upon the terms and conditions set forth in
this Section 5.11(b) and promptly gives notice to Holdings of such option
(but in no event later than the date the After-Acquired Business was
acquired). The purchase price for the Restricted Portion shall be an amount
equal to the aggregate purchase price, including any liabilities assumed by a
Parent Entity, paid by a Parent Entity for the After-Acquired Business,
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the net operating
profit or other mutually acceptable measure of value of the Restricted
Portion during the most recently completed fiscal year prior to the date such
Parent Entity acquired the After-Acquired Business and the denominator of
which shall be the net operating profit or other mutually acceptable measure
of value of the After-Acquired Business during the same period.

 

>  
>

>>  

>>

>> (i) The purchase of the Restricted Portion by Holdings will be subject to 
the execution by the Parent Entity and Holdings of a mutually satisfactory 
definitive agreement for such purchase and the obtaining of all necessary 
regulatory approvals from any Governmental Authority and material third 
party Consents (in each case at no out-of-pocket cost or  expense to the
Parent Entity) and the expiration or termination of any  applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act and any applicable Foreign  Competition Laws. The
Parent Entity's representations and warranties  in the definitive purchase
agreement for the Restricted Portion shall be  limited to reasonable
assurances that the applicable Parent Entity had  caused the Restricted
Portion to be operated in the ordinary course of  business during the period
of such Parent Entity's ownership, and  the Parent Entity shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its  rights under the purchase
agreement by which it acquired the  After-Acquired Business to the extent
relating to the Restricted  Portion to be assigned or otherwise made
available to Holdings. The  definitive purchase agreement shall provide that
such agreement may be  terminated at the option of either a Parent Entity (or
the applicable  Non-Bison Subsidiary) or Holdings if such transaction is
not  consummated by the six month anniversary of the date the  After-
Acquired Business was acquired by a Parent Entity.

>>

>>  

>>

>> (ii) If Holdings fails to give Parent notice of its intent to exercise 
this option on or before the one month anniversary of the date the  After-
Acquired Business was acquired or the sale of the Restricted  Portion to
Holdings is not consummated, other than because of a default by a  Parent
Entity, the Parent Entity may retain ownership of the  After-Acquired
Business, including the Restricted Portion.

Certificate of Designation) as amended through the date of the Closing;

any indemnification amounts which Holdings Indemnified Parties would be 
entitled pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i), whether or not asserted pursuant to

that Parent's  indemnification obligation for breach of any representation or
warranty  contained in Section 3.2(b) or (c) and pursuant to Sections
8.1(b)(ii) and  (iii) shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section
8.1(d)(i).

>>  

>>

>> (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this 
Agreement, in the event that a Holdings Indemnified Party is entitled to any 
indemnification amounts pursuant to Section 5.8 (i), Section 8.1(b)(i) or 
Section 8.2(a) in connection with Losses or Environmental Losses, as 
applicable, relating to or arising out of the business conducted by THI or 
its Subsidiaries, then, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 
8.1(d)(i) and Section 8.2(a), Parent shall pay (A) a minimum of 50% of such 
Losses or Environmental Loses, as applicable, at the time otherwise 
specified in Section 8.1 (and the remaining Losses shall not be taken into 
account for the purposes of calculating the deductibles, baskets and cap set 
forth in Section 8.1(d)(i) and Section 8.2(a)) and (B) the remaining 50% of 
such Losses or Environmental Losses, as applicable, when, and only to the 
extent that, Parent or its Subsidiaries receive cash in connection with the

>>  

>>

>> (iii) No party shall be liable for any Losses pursuant to Sections 8.1(b)

Section 4.4(a) and (b), such notice of Claim may be delivered at any time, 
(B) for breach of any covenant or agreement, such notice of Claim may be

limitation and (C) for Environmental Losses such notice of Claim may be 
delivered on or prior to the period specified in Section 8.2. 
Indemnification under Section 8.1(b)(i) and (ii) and Section 8.1(c)(i) and

applicable, shall be indemnification pursuant to Section 5.8) contained in 
this Agreement, the Transition Agreement and the Assignment and Assumption 
Agreement.

>>  

>

(e) _Notice of Claim_. If the Indemnified Party shall become aware of any
claim, proceeding or other matter (a "Claim") which may give rise to a Loss
or Environmental Loss that will be taken into account for purposes
of calculating whether the Indemnifying Party's indemnification
obligation arises pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(c) above or
Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3 below, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
give notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall specify
whether the Claim arises as a result of a Claim by a Person against the
Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim") or whether the Claim does not so
arise (a "Direct Claim"), and shall also specify with reasonable
particularity (to the extent that the information is available) the factual
basis for the Claim and the amount of the Claim, if known. If the Indemnified
Party does not promptly give notice of any Claim as specified above, such
failure shall not be deemed a waiver of the Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification or application to the applicable deductible set forth in
Section 8.1(d), Section 8.2(a)(iii) or Section 8.2 (a)(iv) hereunder for
Losses or Environmental Losses in connection with such Claim, but the amount
of reimbursement to which the Indemnified Party is entitled or application to
the applicable deductible shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which
the Indemnified Party's Losses or Environmental Losses would have been
reduced had such notice been promptly delivered.

 

(f) _Direct Claims_. With respect to any Direct Claim, following receipt of
notice from the Indemnified Party of the Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall have 90 days to make such investigation of the Claim as is considered
necessary or desirable. For the purpose of such investigation, the
Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party the
information relied upon by the Indemnified Party to substantiate the Claim,
together with all such other information as the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request. If both parties agree at or prior to the expiration of
such 90-day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof) to the
validity and amount of such Claim, they shall agree to apply it to the
applicable deductible, or if the applicable deductible has been satisfied,
the Indemnifying Party shall immediately pay to the Indemnified Party the
full agreed upon amount of the Claim, failing which the matter shall be
referred to binding arbitration in such manner as the parties may agree or
shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of
Delaware.

 

(g) _Third Party Claims_.

 

>  
>

>>  

>>

>> (i) With respect to any Third Party Claims, the Indemnifying Party shall 
have the right, at its expense and at its election, to assume control of the 
negotiation, settlement and defense of the Claim through counsel of its 
choice reasonably acceptable to the other party; _provided_ , that it 
irrevocably agrees that the Claim is covered by Section 8.1(b) or (c), as 
the case may be. In such event, the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the 
Indemnified Party for all the Indemnified Party's reasonable  out-of-pocket
expenses as a result of such assumption. The  election of the Indemnifying
Party to assume such control shall be made  within the latter of 90 days of
receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim  or thirty days after the
indemnification obligation arises, failing which  the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to have elected not to assume such  control. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume such control, the  Indemnified Party
shall have the right to be informed and consulted with  respect to the
negotiation, settlement or defenses of such Third Party Claim  and to retain
counsel to act on its behalf, but the fees and disbursements  of such counsel
shall be paid by the Indemnified Party unless the  Indemnifying Party
consents to the retention of such counsel or unless the  named parties to any
action or proceeding include both the Indemnifying  Party and the Indemnified
Party and a representation of both the  Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party by the same counsel would be  inappropriate due to the
actual or potential differing interests between  them (such as the
availability of different defenses). If the Indemnifying  Party, having
elected to assume such control, thereafter fails to defend the  Third Party
Claim within a reasonable period of time, the Indemnified Party  shall be
entitled to assume such control, and the Indemnifying Party shall  be bound
by the results obtained by the Indemnified Party with respect to  the Third
Party Claim. If any Third Party Claim is of a nature such that the 
Indemnified Party is required by applicable Law to make a payment to any 
Person (a "Third Party") with respect to the Third Party Claim  before the
completion of settlement negotiations or related legal  proceedings, the
Indemnified Party may make such payment and the  Indemnifying Party shall,
subject to the provisions of Section 8.1, Section  8.2 and Section 8.3, after
demand by the Indemnified Party, reimburse the  Indemnified Party for such
payment. If the amount of any liability of the  Indemnified Party under the
Third Party Claim in respect of which such  payment was made, as finally
determined, is less than the amount which was  paid by the Indemnifying Party
to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified  Party shall, promptly after
receipt of the difference from the Third Party,  pay the amount of such
difference to the Indemnifying Party.

>>

>>  

>>

>> (ii) If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume control of the defense of, 
or having assumed such control fails to defend, any Third Party Claim, the 
Indemnified Party shall have the exclusive right to consent, settle or pay 
the amount claimed, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be 
responsible for paying any such Claim or, if paid by the Indemnified Party, 
reimbursing the Indemnified Party. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party 
assumes control of the negotiation, settlement or defense of any Third Party 
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Third Party Claim without 
the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be 
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless such settlement 
provides solely for monetary damages or other monetary payments.

>>

>>  

>>

>> (iii) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate 
fully with each other with respect to Third Party Claims and, regardless of 
which party has control thereof as provided for herein, shall keep each 
other reasonably advised with respect thereto.

>>

>>

(h) Notwithstanding anything in Section 8.1, Section 8.2 or Section 8.3
to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any Losses
or Environmental Losses arising out of any matter to the extent that the
Losses or Environmental Losses with respect to such matter have been
mitigated as a result of having been reflected as a liability or the subject
matter of a specific result in the Closing Financial Statement.

.

 

(a) (i) Except for the environmental matters set forth in Section

notice of said Claim in the manner set forth in Section 8.1(e)  within 10
years after the Closing Date. Parent's obligation to  indemnify the Holdings

notice of said Claim in the manner set forth in Section  8.1(e) within two
years after the Closing Date.

>>

>>  

>>

>> (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not have any liability 
with respect to the payment of any indemnification amounts pursuant to 
Section 8.2(a)(i)(A) through (D) until such time as the aggregate amount of 
such Environmental Losses incurred by the Holdings Indemnified Parties, 
excluding any and all Environmental Losses related to, or arising out of, 
(A) the Dover Municipal Landfill located in Dover, New Hampshire and (B) the 
Cardinal Landfill located in Farmington, New Hampshire, for which such 
parties would otherwise be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 
8.2(a)(i)(A) through (D) exceeds five million dollars ($5,000,000) and 
thereafter, Parent shall only be liable to the extent of such Environmental 
Losses in excess of five million dollars ($5,000,000); _provided_ , _however_
,  that (A) Holdings shall not make any claim against Parent which
individually  does not exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), and such
claims not  meeting this threshold shall not be applied in calculating the
five million  dollar ($5,000,000) limitation specified above, and (B)
Parent's  maximum aggregate indemnification liability pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(i)  shall be subject to and included within the dollar limitation
contained in  Section 8.1(d)(i)(B).

>>

>>  

>>

>> (iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parent shall 
not have any liability with respect to the payment of any indemnification 
amounts pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i)(A) through (D) with respect to 
Environmental Losses related to, or arising out of, (A) the Dover Municipal 
Landfill located in Dover, New Hampshire and (B) the Cardinal Landfill 
located in Farmington, New Hampshire until such time as the aggregate amount 
of such Environmental Losses incurred by the Holdings Indemnified Parties 
for which such parties would otherwise be entitled to indemnification 
pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i)(A) through (D) exceeds twenty million dollars 
($20,000,000) and thereafter, Parent shall be liable for fifty percent (50%) 
of such Environmental Losses in excess of twenty million dollars 
($20,000,000).

>>

>>  

>>

>> (v) Holdings and CandA; Products shall jointly and severally indemnify  and
hold the Parent Indemnified Parties harmless against any Environmental 
Losses relating to the environmental matters set forth in Section 8.2(a)(i) 
of the Disclosure Schedule (other than any Environmental Losses relating to 
THI or any of its Subsidiaries incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties 
prior to the earlier of (A) the first date that Holdings or CandA; Products  is
required to account for THI and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis  and
(B) the date the Put Notice is delivered pursuant to Section 5.20(c)). 
Holdings and CandA; Products shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold 
the Parent Indemnified Parties harmless against any Environmental Losses not 
related to the environmental matters set forth in Section 8.2(a)(i) of the 
Disclosure Schedule arising out of the matters described in Section 
8.2(a)(i)(A)-(D) up to a maximum amount of (x) twenty million  dollars
($20,000,000) for Environmental Losses related to the Dover  Municipal
Landfill located in Dover, New Hampshire and the Cardinal Landfill  located
in Farmington, New Hampshire; provided, however, if the Parent  Indemnified
Parties Environmental Losses exceed twenty million dollars, then  Holdings
and CandA; Products shall jointly and severally indemnify the  Parent
Indemnified Parties for 50% of all Environmental Losses in excess of  twenty
million dollars, and (y) five million dollars ($5,000,000) for all  other
such Environmental Losses (other than any Environmental Losses  relating to

prior to the earlier of (A) the first date that Holdings  or CandA; Products is
required to account for THI and its Subsidiaries on a  consolidated basis and
(B) the date the Put Notice is delivered pursuant to  Section 5.20(c)). For
avoidance of doubt, any amounts paid by Holdings  pursuant to this Section
8.2(j) shall be deemed to be Environmental Losses  incurred by the Holdings
Indemnified Parties for purposes of the limits set  forth in sections
8.2(a)(iii) and 8.2(a)(iv).

>>

>>  

>>

>> (vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if a Holdings 
Indemnified Party has a claim pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i)(D) of this 
Agreement, Parent shall indemnify the Holdings Indemnified Parties with 
respect to (A) any claims for fines or penalties arising out of said 
noncompliance and (B) Environmental Losses arising out of any expenditures 
made or actions taken by or on behalf of Holdings or CandA; Products after  the
Closing Date to correct such noncompliance, but only to the extent that  the
Environmental Losses relate to the least expensive, commercially  reasonable
alternative necessary to correct such noncompliance; _provided_ ,  that
Holdings shall not make any claim against Parent pursuant to this  Section
8.2(a)(vi)(B) which individually does not exceed fifty thousand  dollars
($50,000) with respect to any single occurrence of noncompliance; _provided_
,  _further_ , that with respect to any single occurrence of noncompliance, 
Parent shall only be liable for such Environmental Losses in excess of fifty 
thousand dollars ($50,000). If Holdings or CandA; Products elects to  correct
such noncompliance by any means other than the least expensive,  commercially
reasonable alternative, subject to the provisions of this  Section 8.2,
Parent shall indemnify the Holdings Indemnified Parties for  Environmental
Losses up to an amount equal to the difference between the  Environmental
Losses that otherwise would have been incurred if the least  expensive,
commercially reasonable alternative had been implemented and five  hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000). Further, with respect to claims  pursuant to
Section 8.2(a)(i)(D) which involve a violation that commenced  prior to the
Closing Date and continues after the Closing Date,  Parent's indemnification
obligation with respect to such continuing  violation shall apply only with
respect to the time period prior to the  Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
above, the foregoing shall not be  interpreted to preclude the Holdings
Indemnified Parties from  indemnification with respect to the Remediation of
Hazardous Substances that  are present on or before the Closing Date in any
environmental media at, on,  under or migrating from or to, any Bison
Property, as otherwise provided in  this Agreement, including with respect to
Hazardous Substances that were  discharged into the environment prior to the
Closing Date and continue to  exist in the environment after the Closing
Date.

(b) With respect to claims to indemnify Holdings Indemnified Parties that
are described by Section 8.2(a)(i)(A):

 

>  
>

>>  

>>

>> (i) Parent shall only be required to indemnify Holdings Indemnified 
Parties to the extent that, after the deductible set forth in Section 
8.2(a)(iii) is met: (A) the Remediation of the Hazardous Substances is 
required pursuant to an applicable Environmental Law that is in effect as of 
the Closing Date; (B) the Remediation Standards applicable to the 
Remediation are the most cost effective Remediation Standards required under 
Environmental Law assuming continued industrial use of the property,
_provided_ ,  that it is a Bison Property and where it is not, such other use
then  associated with such non-Bison Property; and (C) the Remediation 
shall be conducted in a reasonable, cost effective manner consistent with 
applicable Environmental Law or as may be otherwise required by a 
Governmental Authority. Holdings shall accept appropriate engineering 
controls or institutional controls, including, if necessary, deed 
restrictions limiting property to an industrial use or limitations on the 
drilling and use of water wells on Bison Properties (individually or 
collectively, a "Restriction"), if such controls are needed in  order to
complete a Remediation consistent with the use of the least  stringent
Remediation Standards. Holdings shall not be required to consent  to any
Restriction in connection with completing a Remediation if the  Restriction
would materially impair or otherwise unreasonably interfere with  the
continued operations of the Bison Subsidiary or if the Governmental 
Authority having jurisdiction for such matter does not approve of reliance 
on such Restriction.

>>

>>  

>>

>> (ii) For the sole purpose of seeking indemnification for Environmental 
Losses pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) of this Agreement, after the Closing 
Date, neither Holdings nor its Affiliates shall undertake any effort to 
discover whether there has been a release of Hazardous Substances at, on, 
underneath or migrating from any Bison Property, including the collection of 
soil, groundwater, or surface water samples or samples of other 
environmental media, except that Holdings or its authorized representatives 
may take such samples _and_ the Holdings Indemnified Parties may seek 
indemnification therefore if: (A) required pursuant to an applicable 
Environmental Law or a lawful order of a Governmental Authority; (B) 
required by a potential acquirer of said Bison Property or the Business or a 
lessee of said Bison Property; (C) required in connection with defending 
against or pursuing a Third Party Claim; or (D) required by  Holdings' or
CandA; Products' lender or financial  underwriter prior to five years from the
Closing Date. If Holdings fails to  comply in any material respect with this
provision, Parent shall have no  obligation to provide any Holdings
Indemnified Party with an indemnity for  the Remediation of Hazardous
Substances on such Bison Property or for any  Claims for bodily injury or
property damage related to Hazardous Substances  on such property; _provided_
, _however_ , that this limitation on  indemnification shall apply only the
extent that any Environmental Losses  incurred by a Holdings Indemnified
Party for which indemnification is sought  are identified solely as a result
of such material noncompliance.

>>

>>  

>
>  

 

(c) Claims brought pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall be subject to
the procedures for indemnification set forth in Section 8.1(g) if such Claims
are Third Party Claims. Claims that involve or also involve the Remediation
of Hazardous Substances at any Bison Property shall also be subject to
the procedures set forth in Section 8.2(f).

 

(d) If Holdings or any of its Affiliates intends to sell, lease or
otherwise convey any Bison Subsidiary or any Bison Property, Holdings or said
Affiliate shall include, as a condition of such sale, lease or other
agreement, terms and conditions that will ensure that all Restrictions that
have been accepted with respect to the Bison Property are not disturbed (or,
if such Restrictions will be disturbed, that they will be restored at the
expense of the party causing the disturbance or, if additional Remediation is
required as a result of the disturbance of such Restrictions, that such
additional Remediation will be performed at the sole cost and expense of the
party causing the disturbance).

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement: (1) the term "Environmental Losses" shall
only include the following costs and expenses (after giving effect to any
related reduction in Taxes and amounts recovered from third parties,
including amounts recovered under insurance policies, with respect to such
Environmental Losses): (A) costs and expenses to implement a Remediation; (B)
damages for third party bodily injury and third party property damage;
(C) fines and penalties; and (D) reasonable attorneys' fees, consultants'
fees and expenses associated with (A), (B) or (C), including costs and
expenses associated with Litigation; (2) the term "Remediation Standard"
means a numerical standard (whether resulting from an enacted statute,
promulgated regulation, guidance or policy document issued by a Governmental
Authority, or developed on a case-by-case basis through a risk assessment or
other methodology authorized pursuant to an applicable Environmental Law and,
if appropriate, approved by a Governmental Authority) that defines
the concentrations of Hazardous Substances that may be permitted to remain in
any environmental media after an investigation, remediation or containment of
a release of Hazardous Substances; (3) the term "Remediation" means
any action of any kind to investigate and/or clean up and/or otherwise
respond a release of Hazardous Substances into an environmental medium,
including the following activities: (A) monitoring, investigation,
assessment, treatment, cleanup, containment, removal, mitigation,
remediation, corrective action, response or restoration work; (B) obtaining
any permits, consents, approvals or authorizations of any Governmental
Authority necessary to conduct any such activity; (C) preparing and
implementing any plans or studies for any such activity; and (D) obtaining a
written notice from a Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the site
being addressed under Environmental Laws that no additional work is required
by such Governmental Authority; and (4) the term "Off-Site Location" means
any location other than (x) any Bison Property or (y) property adjacent to
any Bison Property which has been impacted by a release of Hazardous
Substances at, on, under or from any Bison Property.

 

(f) _Procedures for Remedial Actions_.

>>  

>>

>> (i) Parent shall be entitled to assume control of Remediations at or with 
respect to any Bison Property (other than the Dover Municipal Landfill and 
the Cardinal Landfill) if the deductible set forth in Section 8.2(a)(iii) is 
met. The election of Parent to assume control of any such Remediation shall 
be made within a reasonable time. In the event that Parent shall control any 
Remediation, it shall promptly provide copies to Holdings of all notices, 
correspondence, draft reports, submissions, draft and final work plans and 
final reports and shall give Holdings a reasonable opportunity (at  Holding's
own expense) to comment on any submissions Parent intends  to deliver or
submit to the appropriate regulatory body prior to said  submission. The
party not controlling any Remediation may, at its own  expense, hire its own
consultants, attorneys or other professionals to  monitor the work performed
by the party controlling such Remediation,  including any field work
undertaken by such party. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, Parent and
Holdings, as applicable, agree to cooperate with each  other, directly and
through their respective consultants and counsel, to  effect the successful
completion of the Remediation within such period as  may be specified by a
Governmental Authority or under applicable  Environmental Laws, or otherwise
within a reasonable period of time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that neither
party shall take any actions that could  unreasonably delay or unreasonably
interfere with the performance of the  work of the party controlling any
Remediation.

>> (ii) If Holdings or CandA; Products is required to or desires to  undertake
a Remediation at or with respect to the Dover Municipal Landfill  or the
Cardinal Landfill that either Holdings or Parent determines is  reasonably
likely to cause the deductible set forth in Section 8.2(a)(iv) to  be met,
then Holdings shall notify Parent prior to undertaking such  Remediation, and
Parent and Holdings shall consult with each other, in good  faith, to
implement a mutually agreeable course of action to effect such  Remediation.
In the event of such determination, Holdings or CandA;  Products shall promptly
provide copies to Parent of all notices,  correspondence, draft reports,
submissions, draft and final work plans and  final reports and shall give
Parent a reasonable opportunity (at  Parent's expense) to comment on any
submissions Holdings intends to  deliver or submit to the appropriate
regulatory body prior to said  submission. Parent may, at its own expense,
hire its own consultants,  attorneys or other professionals to monitor the
work performed by Holdings  or CandA; Products, including any field work

and counsel, to effect the  successful completion of the Remediation within
such period as may be  specified by a Governmental Authority or under

(g) _Exclusive Remedy for Environmental Matters; Indemnification
by Holdings_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Holdings and CandA; Products hereby agree that their sole and
exclusive remedy against any Parent Indemnified Party with respect to any and
all Losses arising under or related to any Environmental Law or any Hazardous
Substances or the environment, including statutory or common law claims for
Environmental Losses, damages, fines, penalties or response costs related to
Hazardous Substances or the environment, in connection with the Bison
Subsidiaries, shall be the indemnity set forth in this Section 8.2. Except
with respect to the remedy referred to in the preceding sentence, Holdings
and CandA; Products hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, and forever releases the Parent Indemnified Parties, in
connection with the Bison Subsidiaries from, and shall indemnify the Parent
Indemnified Parties against, any and all Environmental Losses arising under
or related to Environmental Laws or Hazardous Substances. Parent Indemnified
Parties shall not make any claim against Holdings for indemnification for any
Loss, including any Environmental Loss, pursuant to this Section 8.2(g) which
individually does not exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). Holdings'
obligation to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to this
Section 8.2(g) shall be limited to those matters as to which Parent provides
Holdings with written notice of said Claim in the manner set forth in Section
8.1(e).

 

(h) _Disputes_. In the event of any dispute between Parent and Holdings or
CandA; Products concerning a Claim for indemnification for Environmental Losses
under this Section 8.2 which cannot be resolved within thirty (30) days, such
dispute shall be promptly referred to an independent third party
having expertise in the matters at issue and mutually acceptable to the
parties (or if the parties cannot agree, the CPR Institute for Dispute
Resolution, in New York, New York shall select a recognized expert who shall
be independent from each of the parties), whose fees and expenses shall be
shared equally by the parties, and who shall evaluate the facts and
circumstances at issue and recommend a course of action that the expert
believes in its good faith judgment satisfies the requirements of this
Agreement and applicable Environmental Laws. Such recommendations shall be
final and binding on the parties. The parties agree to act as promptly as
practicable in implementing the foregoing procedures; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that in the event that actions are required to be taken by a Governmental
Authority or in an emergency to avoid imminent and substantial harm to health
or the environment before the foregoing procedures can be
implemented, Holdings or CandA; Products may undertake such actions without
prejudice to its rights under this Section 8.2 to seek indemnification for
Environmental Losses. In all other situations, Holdings' or CandA; Products'
failure to comply with the requirements of this Section 8.2(h) shall not
limit or reduce the obligations of Parent under this Agreement except to the
extent Parent is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.

 

(i) _Other_. Nothing contained in this Section 8.2 shall restrict Holdings or
CandA; Products from taking any action (and, if appropriate pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(i), seeking indemnification therefore) where required to be taken by
any Governmental Authority or in an emergency to avoid imminent and
substantial harm to health or the environment.

  

8.3 _Quota Purchase Agreement Indemnification

 _ 

. Holdings and CandA; Products shall indemnify Parent from and against and in
respect of any and all Losses incurred by Parent under any
guarantee agreement by and between Parent and S.W. Industries Inc., or any

of Parent's rights, and the assumption by CandA; Products of Parent's
obligations, under the Quota Purchase Agreement dated as of May 31, 2000 by
and between Textron International Holdings, S.L. and S.W. Industries Inc., or
if no such assignment has occurred prior to the Closing, the parties hereto
shall take the actions relating to the Brazilian Entities specified in the
Transition Agreement.

  

8.4 _Name Changes

 _ 

. CandA; Products and its Subsidiaries shall have the right to use, subject to
Parent's reasonable quality control requirements (as the same may exist from
time to time), the name "Textron" in the Business for a period of eighteen
months following the Closing Date, and in exchange therefor, CandA; Products
shall pay to Parent, in cash, (i) thirteen million forty thousand dollars
($13,040,000) on December 15, 2002 and (ii) six million five hundred twenty
thousand dollars ($6,520,000) on December 15, 2003. In the event that CandA;
Products is unable to make such cash payments to Parent on the dates
specified above without causing a Material Breach, such amounts shall accrue
interest from and including December 15, 2002 and December 15,
2003, respectively, compounding monthly, at the Interest Rate. CandA; Products
shall pay such amounts, whether in whole or in part, as soon as possible
without causing a Material Breach. On or before the eighteen month
anniversary of the Closing Date, Holdings or CandA; Products will change the
names of the entities listed in Section 8.4 of the Disclosure Schedule and
cease using the name "Textron" in any manner. Holdings and CandA; Products
agree that from and after the Closing Date, (i) the name "Textron" and all
similar related names (all such names being the "Parent Names") shall be
owned by Parent or a Non-Bison Subsidiary, (ii) neither Holdings,
CandA; Products nor any Bison Subsidiary shall have any rights in, and shall
not, after the eighteen month anniversary of the Closing Date, use, any
Parent Name and (iii) neither Holdings, CandA; Products nor any Bison
Subsidiary shall contest the ownership or validity of any rights of Parent or
any Non-Bison Subsidiary in or to the Parent Names.

jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions of this Agreement.

  

9.2 _Principle of Construction

 _

Contracts and assets not owned as of any date of determination by a Bison
Subsidiary (and the related liabilities) but which are intended to be made
the subject of the transfer and assignment contemplated by the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement shall be construed as pertaining to the business,
operations, assets, properties, liabilities and Contracts of the Bison
Subsidiaries and the Business. In furtherance thereof, any action not
permitted to be taken by a Bison Subsidiary with respect to the Business
shall apply to Parent and its Subsidiaries.

part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party. The failure of
any party at any time or times to demand performance of any provision hereof
shall in no manner affect the right of such party at a later time to enforce
the same or any other provision of this Agreement. No waiver of any condition
or the breach of any term contained in this Agreement in one or more
instances shall be deemed to be a, or construed as a further or continuing,
waiver of such condition or breach.

  

9.6 _Counterparts

 _ 

. For the convenience of the parties hereto, this Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to

Company, having the designations, preferences, relative, participating,
optional and other special rights of the shares of each such series, and the
qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof that are set forth in
the Certificate of Incorporation and in this Resolution, as follows:

 

SECTION 1. _Designation, Amount and Issuance_. (a) Of the six series of
Preferred Stock authorized by this Resolution, the Series A1 Redeemable
Preferred Stock, the Series B1 Redeemable Preferred Stock and the Series C1
Redeemable Preferred Stock are to be initially issued in connection with the
Acquisition and the Series A2 Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Series B2
Redeemable Preferred Stock and the Series C2 Redeemable Preferred Stock are
to be initially issued as necessary to comply with the registration and
exchange provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement. Additional shares

A2 Redeemable Preferred Stock may be issued in accordance with Section 7(d)
and additional shares of Series B1 Redeemable Preferred Stock or Series B2
Redeemable Preferred Stock may also be issued in accordance with Section
5(e). The designations for the six series of Preferred Stock authorized by
this Resolution shall be (1) the 15% Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock,
without par value (the **" Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock"**), (2) the
16% Series B1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, without par value (the " **Series
B1 Redeemable Preferred Stock**"), (3) the 16% Series C1 Redeemable Preferred
Stock, without par value (the " **Series C1 Redeemable Preferred
Stock**"), (4) the 15% Series A2 Redeemable Preferred Stock, without
par value (the " **Series A2 Redeemable Preferred Stock**" and, together
with the Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, the " **Series A Redeemable
Preferred Stock**"), (5) the 16% Series B2 Redeemable Preferred Stock,
without par value (the " **Series B2 Redeemable Preferred Stock**" and,
together with the Series B1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, the " **Series B

Redeemable Preferred Stock, without par value (the " **Series C2
Redeemable Preferred Stock**" and, together with the Series C1
Redeemable Preferred Stock, the " **Series C Redeemable Preferred
Stock**" and such Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock, together with
the Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock and the Series B Redeemable
Preferred Stock, the " **Redeemable Preferred Stock** "). The liquidation
preference of the Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Series B1
Redeemable Preferred Stock and the Series C1 Redeemable Preferred Stock at
their Issuance Date is $1,000 per share and the original issue price for each
such share is $1,000. The issue price per share or Liquidation Preference of
the Redeemable Preferred Stock shall not for any purpose be considered to be
a determination by the Board of Directors with respect to the capital and
surplus of the Company. The liquidation preference of the Series A2
Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Series B2 Redeemable Preferred Stock and the
Series C2 Redeemable Preferred Stock at their Issuance Date will equal the
Liquidation Preference of the Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, the
Series B1 Redeemable Preferred Stock and the Series C1 Redeemable Preferred
Stock, respectively, at such Issuance Date pursuant to the terms of the
Registration Rights Agreement (which is inclusive of an amount of Series A
Accrued Dividends, Series B Accrued Dividends and Series C
Accrued Dividends, respectively, equal to that of the Series A1
Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Series B1 Redeemable Preferred Stock and
the Series C1 Redeemable Preferred Stock at such time). The number of shares
constituting the Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be 182,700
shares. The number of shares constituting the Series B1 Redeemable Preferred
Stock shall be 123,700 shares. The number of shares constituting the Series
C1 Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be 20,000 shares. The number of shares
constituting the Series A2 Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be 182,700
shares. The number of shares constituting the Series B2 Redeemable Preferred
Stock shall be 123,700 shares. The number of shares constituting the Series
C2 Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be 20,000 shares. In addition, each
series of Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be constituted by up to an
additional [ ] shares of such series to be available for issuance from time
to time as provided for in Sections 1(b) and 7(d) and each series of Series B
Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be further constituted (a) by up to an
additional [ ] shares of such series to be available for issuance as
provided in Section 5(e) and (b) by up to an additional 125,000 shares of
such series to be available for issuance as provided in Section 1(c). None of
the shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock acquired by the Company by reason
of redemption, purchase or otherwise shall be reissued as such, but may
be redesignated for reissuance as shares of a different class or series
of Preferred Stock in compliance with the terms hereof. Except as provided
in Section 1(b), Section 7(d) and Section 5(e), the Company shall only issue
the shares of the Series A2 Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Series B2
Redeemable Preferred Stock and the Series C2 Redeemable Preferred Stock to
the Holders of the Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Series B1
Redeemable Preferred Stock and the Series C1 Redeemable Preferred Stock,
as applicable, as is necessary to comply with the registration and
exchange provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement.

 

(b) In the event that the Company shall be required to pay Liquidated
Damages pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement and shall elect to pay
such Liquidated Damages in kind, on each Dividend Payment Date the Company
shall issue to each Holder entitled to Liquidated Damages in respect of
shares of a series of Redeemable Preferred Stock held by such Holder such
number of newly issued shares of such series of Redeemable Preferred Stock as
is equal to (x) the Liquidated Damages then due to such Holder in respect of
shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock of such series held by such Holder,
divided by (y) the Liquidation Preference plus Total Cash Dividends in
Arrears (inclusive of Additional Dividends and accrued regular dividends from
the preceding Dividend Payment Date if not concurrently paid or accrued
in accordance with the terms hereof) in respect of each share of
Redeemable Preferred Stock of such series as of such Dividend Payment Date.
Each newly issued share of Redeemable Preferred Stock of a series issued to a
Holder shall be identical in all respects, including Liquidation Preference
and Total Cash Dividends in Arrears, to all other shares of Redeemable
Preferred Stock of the same series held by such Holder. In lieu of any
issuing any fractional shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock of any series,
the Company may deliver to a Holder an amount in cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the amount set forth in clause (y) of the preceding sentence
with respect to such series.

 

(c) In the event that the Company shall be permitted, in accordance with
the terms of the Purchase Agreement, to satisfy all or a portion of
the Earn-Out Amount, if any, in additional shares of Series B
Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Company may issue such number of additional
shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock having at the time of payment
an aggregate Liquidation Preference plus Total Cash Dividends in Arrears
(inclusive of any Additional Dividends accruing from the most recent Dividend
Payment Date) plus accrued regular dividends equal to the Earn-Out Amount or
portion thereof that the Company is permitted to so satisfy under the terms
of the Purchase Agreement. If any Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding immediately prior to such issuance, all newly issued shares
of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be of the same series as
all other outstanding shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock at
such time and identical to such outstanding shares in all respects, including
as to Liquidation Preference, Total Cash Dividends in Arrears (inclusive of
any Additional Dividends accruing from the most recent Dividend Payment
Date), accrued regular dividends and, if previously obtained with respect
to outstanding Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock, CUSIP number. If no
shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be outstanding
immediately prior to such issuance, all newly issued shares of Series B
Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be issued with a Liquidation Preference of
$1,000.

 

Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, if the Company
is not able to issue Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock in satisfaction of
the Earn-Out Amount as contemplated by the preceding paragraph because
for tax purposes such newly issued shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred
Stock would not be fungible with previously outstanding shares of Series B
Redeemable Preferred Stock, then in lieu of issuing shares Series B
Redeemable Preferred Stock in satisfaction of the Earn-Out Amount, the
Company may, without the consent of any Holder, create a new series of
Redeemable Preferred Stock, to be designated "Series D Redeemable Preferred
Stock," identical to the Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock in all respects,
having an initial Liquidation Preference of $1,000 per share, and, if
required pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, provisions to the effect that
(x) the Series D Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be optionally redeemable by
the Company at any time, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the
Liquidation Preference thereof plus any Total Cash Dividends in Arrears
(inclusive of Additional Dividends accruing from the most recent Dividend
Payment Date) and accrued regular dividends, (y) the Series D Redeemable
Preferred Stock shall be mandatorily redeemable, at the Redemption Price set
forth in the preceding clause (x), within 30 days following any date upon
which the Company would be permitted to redeem all or a portion of the Series
D Redeemable Preferred Stock without causing a Material Breach by the Company
or Parent, whether in one instance or as permitted from time to time (the
foregoing clause (x) and (y) being the "Redemption Terms") and (z) the Series
D Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the
Holder, from time to time, in whole or in part, into shares of Series
B Redeemable Preferred Stock having the terms set forth in the second and
third sentences, as applicable, of the immediately preceding paragraph.

 

SECTION 2. _Dividends_. (a) Subject to Section 7(d) in the case of Textron
Shares only, all shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock will bear dividends,
whether or not earned or declared, out of funds legally available therefor,
from the Issuance Date thereof accruing on the Liquidation Preference thereof
at the rate of (x) (I) for all dividend periods ending on or before July 1,
2003, 11% per annum, and (II) for all dividend periods ending after July 1,
2003, 15% per annum (the " **Series A Dividend Rate**") in the case of the
Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock, (y) (I) for all dividend periods ending
on or before July 1, 2003, 12% per annum, and (II) for all dividend periods
ending after July 1, 2003, 16% per annum (the " **Series B Dividend Rate**")
in the case of the Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock and (z) (I) for all
dividend periods ending on or before July 1, 2003, 12% per annum, and (II)
for all dividend periods ending after July 1, 2003, 16% per annum (the "
**Series C Dividend Rate**" and, together with the Series A Dividend Rate and
the Series B Dividend Rate, the " **Dividend Rate** ") in the case of
the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock and, in each case, will be
payable quarterly in arrears on each Dividend Payment Date, commencing
on April 1, 2002, to Holders of record on the March 15, June 15, September
15 and December 15 immediately preceding the relevant Dividend Payment Date.
In calculating the amount of dividends due on any Dividend Payment Date, the
Liquidation Preference utilized shall be the Liquidation Preference in effect
on the first business day following the immediately preceding Dividend
Payment Date. The Company may, at its option and without notice, elect to
accrue (x) at any time, up to (but not more than) an amount (rounded to the
nearest $.01) equivalent to 7% per annum of the dividends on the Series A
Redeemable Preferred Stock payable on any Dividend Payment Date and up to
(but not more than) an amount (rounded to the nearest $.01) equivalent to 8%
per annum of the dividends on each of the Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock
and the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock payable on any Dividend Payment
Date or (y) at all times through and including the dividend period ending and
Dividend Payment Date on January 1, 2004 during which the payment of cash
dividends on Redeemable Preferred Stock would result in a Material Breach by
the Company or Parent, up to the full amount of all dividends on each series
of Redeemable Preferred Stock payable on any Dividend Payment Date, but only
to the extent necessary to prevent any such breach from occurring (with any
amounts payable in cash being paid on a pro rata basis (based on aggregate
Liquidation Preference) as among each series of Redeemable Preferred Stock);
in each case in lieu of payment of such dividends in cash and, in each such
case, any such accrued dividends (respectively, the " **Series A Accrued
Dividends," "Series B Accrued Dividends**" and " **Series C Accrued
Dividends**") will be added to the Liquidation Preference of the applicable
series of Redeemable Preferred Stock. Additional dividends are payable in
cash in respect of Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock constituting Textron
Shares as provided in Section 7(d) (" **Liquidity Dividends** "); provided
that at all times through and including the dividend period ending and
Dividend Payment Date on January 1, 2004 during which the payment of cash
Liquidity Dividends on Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock would result in a
Material Breach by the Company or Parent, the Company may, without notice,
elect to accrue up to all Liquidity Dividends payable on Series A Redeemable
Preferred Stock payable on any Dividend Payment Date (but only to the extent
necessary to prevent any such breach from occurring), with any such accrual
being added to the Series A Accrued Dividends for the relevant
period. Dividends shall cease to accumulate in respect of the shares of
Redeemable Preferred Stock upon their redemption unless the Company shall
have failed to pay the relevant redemption price on the Redemption Date.

 

(b) All dividends (including pursuant to Section 2(f)) paid with respect to
shares of the Redeemable Preferred Stock pursuant to this Certificate of
Designation shall be paid _pro_ _rata_ to the Holders entitled thereto.

 

(c) Dividends with respect to Redeemable Preferred Stock are payable when,
as and if declared by the Board of Directors, and nothing contained in
this Certificate of Designation shall in any way or under any circumstances
be construed or deemed to require the Board of Directors to declare, or the
Company to pay or set apart for payment, any dividends on shares of the
Redeemable Preferred Stock at any time. Dividends on the Redeemable Preferred
Stock will accrue whether or not the Company has earnings or profits, whether
or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends
and whether or not dividends are declared. The accrual of dividends as Series
A Accrued Dividends, Series B Accrued Dividends or Series C
Accrued Dividends as permitted by Section 2(a) shall be deemed to be a
payment of dividends and shall fulfill the Company's obligations with respect
to the payment of such portion of the dividends payable upon the
Redeemable Preferred Stock for all purposes hereof. Other dividends will
accumulate to the extent they are not paid on the Dividend Payment Date for
the period to which they relate as Cash Dividends in Arrears and accumulated
and unpaid dividends which are required to be paid in cash will bear
Additional Dividends until paid on the same basis as set forth in Section
2(a) of this Certificate of Designation, compounded quarterly on each
Dividend Payment Date.

 

(d) Subject to the Company's option to accrue a portion of the dividends
provided for in Section 2(a), Holders shall be entitled to receive the cash
dividends provided for in this Certificate of Designation (including the
Total Cash Dividends in Arrears) in preference to and in priority over any
cash dividends (including accumulated and unpaid dividends) payable upon any
Junior Securities.

 

(e) At the Issuance Date of the Series A2 Redeemable Preferred Stock and the
Series B2 Redeemable Preferred Stock and the Series C2 Redeemable Preferred
Stock, such shares shall be issued with Total Cash Dividends in Arrears and
accumulated and unpaid dividends for the then current dividend period equal
to that of the Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Series B1 Redeemable
Preferred Stock and the Series C1 Redeemable Preferred Stock for which it is
exchanged pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement.

 

(f) At any time and from time to time when there shall be Total
Cash Dividends in Arrears, the Company may declare and pay, to the Holders of
record of the Redeemable Preferred Stock on any record date chosen by the
Company (which record date shall be not less than 10 and not more than 60
days prior to the payment date for such special dividend) for such dividends,
a special dividend per share of Redeemable Preferred Stock equal to all or a
portion of the Total Cash Dividends in Arrears as of the payment date. Upon
payment of such a dividend, if less than the Total Cash Dividends in Arrears
with respect to a share has been paid, the Cash Dividends in Arrears and
Additional Dividends with respect to such share shall be reduced on a _pro
rata_ basis by the amount of such dividend.

 

(g) No full dividends may be declared or paid or funds set apart for
the payment of dividends on, and the Company shall not make any other
distribution with respect to, any Parity Securities for any period unless the
entire Total Cash Dividends in Arrears for all issued and outstanding shares
of Redeemable Preferred Stock shall have been declared and paid in full,
except as provided below. If at any time there shall exist Total Cash
Dividends in Arrears, the Redeemable Preferred Stock will share dividends
_pro rata_ with the Parity Securities (on the basis of the relative unpaid
amount of Cash Dividends in Arrears and Additional Dividends, in the case of
the Redeemable Preferred Stock and of cumulative accrued and unpaid
dividends, in the case of such Parity Securities).

 

(h) Cash Dividends in Arrears, Additional Dividends and other dividends
in connection with any redemption may be declared and paid at any time,
without reference to any regular Dividend Payment Date, to Holders of record
of the Redeemable Preferred Stock on such date, not more than 60 days prior
to the payment thereof, as may be fixed by the Board of Directors.

 

(i) Dividends payable on the Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be computed
on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and the actual number
of days elapsed in the period for which dividends are payable and shall be
deemed to accrue on a daily basis.

 

SECTION 3. _Liquidation Preference_. Upon any voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, Holders will be
entitled to be paid, out of the assets of the Company available for
distribution to stockholders, the Liquidation Preference per share of
Redeemable Preferred Stock, plus, without duplication, an amount in
cash equal to all accumulated and unpaid dividends (including any Total
Cash Dividends in Arrears), if any, thereon to the date fixed for
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up (including an amount equal to a
prorated dividend for the period from the last Dividend Payment Date to the
date fixed for liquidation, dissolution or winding-up), plus, in the case of
the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock only, an amount in cash equal to the
Common Participation Amount, before any distribution is made on any
Junior Securities, including, without limitation, on any Common Stock of the
Company. If, upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding-up of the Company, the amounts payable with respect to
the Redeemable Preferred Stock and all other Parity Securities are not paid
in full, the Holders of the Redeemable Preferred Stock and the holders of the
Parity Securities will share equally and ratably in any distribution of
assets of the Company in proportion to their relative liquidation
preferences, together with all accumulated and unpaid dividends to which each
is entitled. After payment of the full amount of the Liquidation Preference
and, without duplication, accumulated and unpaid dividends (including any
Total Cash Dividends in Arrears) to which they are entitled, and, in the case
of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock only, an amount in cash equal to
the Common Participation Amount, Holders will not be entitled to any further
participation in any distribution of assets of the Company. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Series B
Redeemable Preferred Stock and the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock
shall constitute Parity Securities with respect to one another. For the
purposes of this Section 3, neither the sale, conveyance, exchange or
transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of
all or substantially all of the property or assets of the Company nor the
consolidation or merger of the Company with one or more entities shall be
deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company. Any
payment of accumulated and unpaid dividends shall be paid prior to any other
payments called for pursuant to this Section 3.

 

SECTION 4. _Voting Rights_. (a) Holders shall be entitled to vote on any
matter required or permitted to be voted upon generally by the holders of
Common Stock of the Company and such vote shall represent an aggregate voting
power equal to 2% of the voting power of the Company's outstanding Common
Stock.

 

(b) In addition, if (i) after January 1, 2003, there shall exist any Total
Cash Dividends in Arrears remaining in arrears and unpaid for any two
consecutive quarterly dividend periods; (ii) the Company fails to discharge
its obligation to redeem Redeemable Preferred Stock on any Redemption Date to
the extent required by Section 5; (iii) the Company fails to make a Par Offer
if such offer is required by the second paragraph of Section 7(d) hereof or
fails to purchase shares of Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock from Holders
who elect to have such shares purchased pursuant to such Par Offer; (iv) a
breach or violation of any other provisions contained in Section 7 hereof
occurs and the breach or violation continues for a period of 45 days or more
after the Company receives notice thereof specifying the default from the
Holders of at least 25% of the shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock then
outstanding; (v) Indebtedness of the Company and/or any Restricted Subsidiary
having an individual or aggregate outstanding principal amount of $25,000,000
or more is declared due and payable following an event of default prior to
its scheduled stated maturity or is not paid in full upon its scheduled
stated maturity; (vi) a decree or order is entered by a court having
jurisdiction in the premises granting relief in respect of any Significant
Subsidiary in any involuntary case under the Federal Bankruptcy Code,
adjudging such Significant Subsidiary a bankrupt, or approving as properly
filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or
composition of or in respect of any Significant Subsidiary under any
Bankruptcy Law, or appointing a receiver, liquidator, custodian, assignee,
trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of any Significant
Subsidiary, or of substantially all of its properties, or ordering the
winding-up or liquidation of its affairs under any such law, and any such
decree or order continues unstayed and in effect for a period of
60 consecutive days; or (vii) any Significant Subsidiary
institutes proceedings to be adjudicated a bankrupt, or any Significant
Subsidiary consents to the institution of bankruptcy proceedings against it,
or any Significant Subsidiary files a petition or answer or consent seeking
reorganization or relief under any Bankruptcy Law, or any Significant
Subsidiary consents to the filing of any such petition or to the appointment
of a receiver, liquidator, custodian, assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or
other similar official) of any Significant Subsidiary, or of substantially
all of its properties under any such law, then, in each such case, the
Holders of the majority of the then outstanding affected series of Redeemable
Preferred Stock (voting or consenting, as the case may be, as one class to
the extent such Voting Rights Triggering Event relates to both series of
Redeemable Preferred Stock) will be entitled to elect two members of the
Board of Directors of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall such Holders be entitled to elect more than two such members. Such
voting rights will continue until such time as (x) in the case of a dividend
default described in clause (i) above, all Total Cash Dividends in Arrears on
the Redeemable Preferred Stock are paid in full, (y) in the case of an event
described in clause (v) above, any such acceleration or event of default has
been rescinded, cured or waived or the Indebtedness relating to such
acceleration has been paid, redeemed, repurchased or defeased in full and (z)
in all other cases, any failure, breach, default or event giving rise to such
voting rights is remedied, cured or waived by the Holders of at least a
majority of the then outstanding affected series of Redeemable Preferred
Stock (voting or consenting, as the case may be, as one class to the extent
such Voting Rights Triggering Event relates to both series of Redeemable
Preferred Stock), after which time the term of the directors elected pursuant
to the provisions of this paragraph shall terminate. Each such event
described in clauses (i) through (vii) above is referred to herein as a "
**Voting Rights Triggering Event**."

 

(c) The Company shall not modify, change, affect or amend (including
in connection with a merger or consolidation, except to the limited
extent contemplated by Section 7(e)) the Certificate of Incorporation or
this Certificate of Designation to affect materially and adversely the
specified rights, preferences, privileges or voting rights of the Holders of
the Redeemable Preferred Stock, or authorize the issuance of any additional
shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock, without the affirmative vote or consent
of Holders of at least a majority of the shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock
then outstanding, voting or consenting, as the case may be, as one class.
In addition, the Company shall not authorize, create (by way of
reclassification, merger, consolidation or otherwise) or issue (i) any Parity
Securities, or any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the
right to purchase any Parity Securities, without the affirmative vote or
consent of the Holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of
Redeemable Preferred Stock except as expressly contemplated hereby, (ii) any
Senior Securities, or any obligation or security convertible into or
evidencing the right to purchase Senior Securities, without the affirmative
vote or consent of the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of the Redeemable Preferred Stock and (iii) any Junior Securities
constituting Disqualified Stock, or any obligation or security convertible
into or evidencing the right to purchase Junior Securities constituting
Disqualified Stock, without the affirmative vote or consent of the Holders of
at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Redeemable Preferred
Stock, in each case voting or consenting, as the case may be, as one class.
Except as expressly set forth above, (i) the creation, authorization or
issuance of any shares of Junior Securities, Parity Securities or Senior
Securities, including the designation of series thereof within the existing
class of Preferred Stock of the Company, or (ii) the increase or decrease in
the amount of authorized Capital Stock of any class, including any Preferred
Stock of the Company (other than the Redeemable Preferred Stock), shall not
require the consent of the Holders and shall not be deemed to affect
materially and adversely the specified rights, preferences, privileges or
voting rights of Holders. The affirmative vote or consent of Holders of at
least a majority of the then issued and outstanding shares of Redeemable
Preferred Stock shall be required to increase the amount of authorized
Redeemable Preferred Stock. No vote of the Holders shall be required to
decrease the number of authorized shares of the Redeemable Preferred Stock;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such number shall not be decreased below the
number of the then currently issued and outstanding shares of Redeemable
Preferred Stock.

 

(d) Immediately after voting power to elect directors shall have
become vested and be continuing in the Holders pursuant to Section 4(b) or
if vacancies shall exist in the offices of directors elected by the
Holders, Holders of at least 10% of the then issued and outstanding shares of
Redeemable Preferred Stock or a proper officer of the Company shall call a
special meeting of the Holders for the purpose of electing the directors
which such Holders are entitled to elect. Any such meeting shall be held at
the earliest practicable date, and the Company shall provide Holders with
access to the lists of Holders. At any meeting held for the purpose of
electing directors at which the Holders shall have the right, voting
separately as a class, to elect directors, the presence in person or by proxy
of the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Redeemable
Preferred Stock shall be required to constitute a quorum of such Holders.

 

(e) Any vacancy occurring in the office of a director elected by the
Holders shall be filled by the Holders.

 

(f) In any case in which the Holders shall be entitled to vote pursuant
to this Section 4 or pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, each Holder shall be entitled to one vote for each share
of Redeemable Preferred Stock held.

 

(g) Holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares
of Redeemable Preferred Stock, voting or consenting, as the case may be,
separately as a single class, may waive compliance with any provision of this
Certificate of Designation.

the Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock will be redeemable at the election of
the Company, as a whole or from time to time in part, at any time on or after
January 1, 2007, at the applicable redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of the Liquidation Preference thereof) set forth below, plus,
without duplication, an amount in cash equal to a prorated dividend for the

(ii) No optional redemption may be made unless prior to such redemption any
Total Cash Dividends in Arrears shall have been fully paid on all shares of
the Redeemable Preferred Stock. If less than all the Redeemable Preferred
Stock of any series is to be redeemed, the particular shares of such series
to be redeemed will be determined _pro_ _rata_ among Holders of such series,
except that the Company may redeem such shares held by any Holder of fewer
than 100 shares without regard to such _pro_ _rata_ redemption requirement.
If any Redeemable Preferred Stock is to be redeemed in part, the Redemption
Notice that relates to such Redeemable Preferred Stock shall state the
portion of the Liquidation Preference to be redeemed. New shares of the same
series of Redeemable Preferred Stock having an aggregate Liquidation
Preference equal to the unredeemed portion will be issued in the name of the
Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original shares of Redeemable
Preferred Stock.

 

(b) _Mandatory Redemption_. (i) The Company shall redeem all outstanding
Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock and Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock
(subject to the legal availability of funds therefor) in whole on January 1,
2013; _provided_ that such date shall be automatically changed upon the
issuance of the Acquisition Notes to be the date that is the first Business
Day which is one year following the final stated maturity date of the
Acquisition Notes (without giving effect to any amendment, modification or
waiver thereof), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the Liquidation
Preference thereof, plus, without duplication, all accumulated and unpaid
dividends (including any Total Cash Dividends in Arrears), if any, to the
Maturity Redemption Date. The Company shall redeem all outstanding Series C
Redeemable Preferred Stock (subject to the legal availability of funds
therefor) in whole on February 1, 2022, at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the Liquidation Preference thereof, plus, without duplication, all
accumulated and unpaid dividends (including any Total Cash Dividends in
Arrears), if any, to the Maturity Redemption Date, plus the Common
Participation Amount.

 

(ii) The Company shall make an offer to redeem (a " **Change of Control
Offer** ") all outstanding Redeemable Preferred Stock (subject to legal
availability of funds therefor) not later than 60 days following a Change of
Control (the " **Change of Control Redemption Date** ") at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the Liquidation Preference thereof, plus, without
duplication, all accumulated and unpaid dividends (including any Total Cash
Dividends in Arrears), if any, to the Change of Control Redemption Date,
plus, in the case of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock only, an amount
equal to the Common Participation Amount; _provided_ that (A) no redemption
under this Section 5(b)(ii) shall be required unless (i) all Existing Notes
shall have ceased to be outstanding, (ii) the Company shall have consummated
a defeasance with respect to the Existing Notes in accordance with the terms
thereof or (iii) the holders of Existing Notes shall have consented to the
Company's performance of its obligations under this Section 5(b)(ii) and (B)
no redemption shall be effected until after the Company has performed all of
its obligations arising upon a "change of control" under any debt instruments
of the Company. The Company shall not consummate a transaction resulting in a
Change of Control unless at the time of or prior to the Change of Control,
the Company shall have entered into customary financial and/or other
arrangements which permit the timely redemption of the Redeemable Preferred
Stock under this Section 5(b)(ii) (disregarding the proviso of the preceding
sentence). The Company may (but shall not be obligated to) discharge any
obligation arising under this Section 5(b)(ii) if a Person other than the
Company (whether or not an Affiliate) makes and consummates a Change of
Control Offer in the manner contemplated, and as required by, this
Certificate of Designation.

 

(iii) In the event of any Asset Disposition resulting in Net Cash Proceeds to
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary required by the terms of the
Company's then outstanding Indebtedness to be applied towards the repayment
of, or any offer to repay, any outstanding Indebtedness of the Company to the
extent that such Net Cash Proceeds are not applied by the Company within 365
days following such Asset Disposition toward the repayment of any such
Indebtedness or are not reinvested in the business of the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries within 365 days following such Asset Disposition,
_first_ the Company shall apply such Net Cash Proceeds towards the making and
consummation of any remaining obligation to offer to purchase or other
repayment of any outstanding Indebtedness of the Company to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the terms thereof, and towards any fees
and expenses associated therewith, and, _second_ , to the extent that any Net
Cash Proceeds remain after any such purchase or repayment and payment of
associated fees and expenses (such remaining proceeds being " **Net Available
Proceeds** ") and provided no default or event of default would result under
the terms of any Indebtedness of the Company, the Company shall (a) declare a
special dividend pursuant to Section 2(e) in an amount equal to the lesser of
(x) the full amount of the entire Total Cash Dividends in Arrears (together
with all other dividends payable in respect thereof) or (y) the amount of
such Net Available Proceeds, and (b) after fulfilling any obligations with
respect to special dividends referred to in the preceding clause (a), apply
any remaining Net Available Proceeds (" **Remaining Net Available Proceeds**
") towards the making and consummation of an offer (an " **Asset
Disposition Offer** ") to redeem shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock, at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the Liquidation Preference thereof, plus,
without duplication, all accumulated and unpaid dividends (including any
Total Cash Dividends in Arrears), if any, to the redemption date (the "
**Asset Disposition Redemption Date** "), which shall be not more than 60 nor
less than 30 days following the Company's satisfaction of all obligations
in respect of such Asset Disposition and the application of the Net Cash
Proceeds therefrom required hereby to be performed prior to the making of an
Asset Disposition Offer, plus, in the case of the Series C Redeemable
Preferred Stock only, an amount equal to the Common Participation Amount.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the amount of Net Available
Proceeds may be recalculated to take account of the _pro rata_ rights of any
holders of Parity Securities, if any.

 

(c) _Dividend Payment_. Any payment of accumulated and unpaid
dividends (including any dividends that have been added to the Liquidation
Preference) shall be declared and paid prior to the payment of any redemption
price made pursuant to this Section 5\. In addition, the Company shall
declare and pay a special dividend as provided in Section 2(f) in respect of
the full amount of any Total Cash Dividends in Arrears prior to the payment
of any redemption price made pursuant to this Section 5\.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 5(c) shall not
result in any requirement to make a duplicative payment upon any redemption
hereunder.

 

(d) _Procedure for Redemptions_. (i) Not more than 60 and not less then 30
days prior to any Redemption Date (or, in the case of a redemption pursuant
to Section 5(b)(ii), not more than 60 and not less than 5 Business Days prior
to any Redemption Date), written notice (the " **Redemption Notice** ") shall
be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to each Holder of record of
shares to be redeemed on the record date fixed for such redemption of the
Redeemable Preferred Stock or entitled to the benefits of a Change of Control
Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, as the case may be, at such Holder's
address as the same appears on the stock register of the Company; _provided_
, _however_ , that (1) a Redemption Notice may be given with respect to a
redemption pursuant to Section 5(b)(ii) on a basis that is conditioned upon
and subject to the occurrence of a Change of Control upon a date that may be
subsequently changed (a " **Conditional Redemption Notice** ") and (2) no
failure to give such notice nor any deficiency therein shall affect the
validity of the procedure for the redemption of any shares of Redeemable
Preferred Stock to be redeemed except as to the Holder or Holders to whom the
Company has failed to give such notice or except as to the Holder or Holders
whose notice was defective. The Redemption Notice shall state:

 

in the case of a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer
only, that a Change of Control has occurred or that Remaining Net Available
Proceeds resulting from an Asset Disposition exist, as the case may be, and
that such Holder has the right to require the Company to redeem such
Holder's Redeemable Preferred Stock at the within mentioned Redemption Price,
in the case of an Asset Disposition Offer, up to a maximum aggregate
Redemption Price equal to the Remaining Net Available Proceeds less the
amount of fees and expenses associated with the making and consummation of
the Asset Disposition Offer;

 

the Redemption Price or, if unascertainable, how the Redemption Price will
be calculated;

 

in the case of an optional redemption only, whether all or less than all
the outstanding shares of a series of Redeemable Preferred Stock are to be
redeemed and the total number of shares of such Redeemable Preferred Stock
being redeemed;

 

in the case of an optional redemption only, the number and series of
shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock held by the Holder that the Company
intends to redeem;

 

in the case of an Asset Disposition Offer only, the aggregate Remaining
Net Available Proceeds available to redeem shares of Redeemable Preferred
Stock pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer and to pay fees and expenses
associated therewith;

 

in the case of an Asset Disposition Offer only, that any shares of
Redeemable Preferred Stock tendered in excess of the maximum number able to
be repurchased with the Remaining Net Available Proceeds (net of fees and
expenses associated with the Asset Disposition Offer) will be returned to the
Holder and will be treated for all purposes as if such shares had not been
tendered for redemption, and that in the event of such an excess tender, the
Company shall select the shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock to be redeemed
as nearly as practicable on a _pro rata_ basis;

 

the Redemption Date or, in the case of a Conditional Redemption Notice,
the first possible and intended Redemption Date;

 

in the case of an optional redemption or maturity date redemption only,
that the Holder is to surrender to the Company, at the place or places that
shall be designated in such Redemption Notice, its certificates representing
the shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock to be redeemed;

 

in the case of a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer
only, that the Holder is to surrender to the Company, at the place or places
that shall be designated in such Redemption Notice, its certificates
representing the shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock that such Holder has
elected to be redeemed;

 

that dividends on the shares of any Redeemable Preferred Stock to be
redeemed shall cease to accumulate on the day prior to such Redemption Date
unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price; and

 

the name of any bank or trust company performing the duties referred to
in subsection (d)(iv) below.

 

(ii) On or before a Redemption Date, each Holder of Redeemable Preferred
Stock to be redeemed shall surrender the certificate or certificates
representing such shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock to the Company, in the
manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and on the
Redemption Date the full redemption price for such shares shall be payable in
cash to the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as
the owner thereof, and each surrendered certificate shall be returned to
authorized but unissued shares. In the event that less than all of the shares
represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be
issued representing the unredeemed shares.

 

(iii) On and after the Redemption Date, unless the Company defaults in the
payment in full of the applicable redemption price, dividends on the
Redeemable Preferred Stock called or tendered for redemption shall cease to
accumulate on the day prior to the Redemption Date, and the Holders of such
shares shall cease to have any further rights with respect thereto on the
Redemption Date, other than the right to receive the redemption price,
without interest.

 

(iv) If a Redemption Notice shall have been duly given or if the Company
shall have given to the bank or trust company hereinafter referred to
irrevocable authorization promptly to give such notice, and if on or before
the Redemption Date specified therein the funds necessary for such redemption
shall have been deposited by the Company with such bank or trust company in
trust for the _pro_   _rata_ benefit of the Holders of the Redeemable
Preferred Stock called or tendered for redemption, then, notwithstanding that
any certificate for shares so called for redemption shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, from and after the time of such deposit, all
shares so called or tendered, or to be so called or tendered pursuant to such
irrevocable authorization, for redemption shall no longer be deemed to be
outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith cease
and terminate, except only the right of the Holders thereof to receive from
such bank or trust company at any time after the time of such deposit the
funds so deposited, without interest. The aforesaid bank or trust company
shall be organized and in good standing under the laws of the United States
of America or of any state within the United States, shall have capital,
surplus and undivided profits aggregating at least $25,000,000 (a "
**Qualified Bank** ") and shall be identified in the Redemption Notice. Any
interest accrued on such funds from and after the Redemption Date shall be
paid to the Company from time to time. Any funds so set aside or deposited,
as the case may be, and unclaimed at the end of one year from such Redemption
Date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the
Company, after which release or repayment the Holders of the shares so called
for redemption shall look only to the Company for payment thereof.

  

(e) _Exchange of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock for Series B Redeemable
Preferred Stock_. At any time after the second anniversary of the Issuance
Date of the Series C1 Redeemable Preferred Stock but prior to the third
anniversary of the Issuance Date of the Series C1 Redeemable Preferred Stock,
at the option of the Company or upon the written request of Holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock,
the Company shall exchange, in whole and not in part, all outstanding shares
of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock for newly issued shares of Series B
Redeemable Preferred Stock. If any Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding immediately prior to such exchange, all newly issued shares of
Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be of the same series as all other
outstanding shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock at such time and
identical to such outstanding shares in all respects, including as to
Liquidation Preference, Total Cash Dividends in Arrears (inclusive of any
Additional Dividends accruing from the most recent Dividend Payment Date),
accrued regular dividends and, if previously obtained with respect to
outstanding Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock, CUSIP number. If no shares
of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be outstanding immediately prior
to such exchange, all newly issued shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred
Stock shall be issued with the same Liquidation Preference, Total Cash
Dividends in Arrears (inclusive of any Additional Dividends accruing from the
most recent Dividend Payment Date) and accrued regular dividends as the
shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock immediately prior to such
exchange (and the Common Exchange Factor shall be calculated on such basis).
The ratio of exchange shall be one share of Series B Redeemable Preferred
Stock multiplied by the Common Exchange Factor for each share of Series C
Redeemable Preferred Stock exchanged. In lieu of issuing any fractional
shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Company may deliver to a
Holder an amount in cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the sum of the
Liquidation Preference plus Total Cash Dividends in Arrears (inclusive of any
Additional Dividends accruing from the most recent Dividend Payment Date)
plus accrued regular dividends in respect of each share of Series B
Redeemable Preferred Stock being issued.

  

Not more than 60 and not less than 10 days prior to an exchange provided
for in the preceding paragraph , written notice (the " **Exchange Notice**
") shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to each Holder
of record of shares to be exchanged on the record date fixed for such
exchange of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock for Series C
Redeemable Preferred Stock, at such Holder's address as the same appears on
the stock register of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
failure to give such notice nor any deficiency therein shall affect the
validity of the procedure for such exchange. The Exchange Notice shall state
(i) the date set for exchange, (ii) the method used to calculate the
Common Exchange Factor, (iii) that the Holder is to surrender to the
Company, at the place or places that shall be designated in such Exchange
Notice, its certificates representing the shares of Series C Redeemable
Preferred Stock to be exchanged, (iv) that following the date set for
exchange, such Holder's shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock shall
cease to accrue dividends, whether or not submitted for exchange, and (v)
that following the date set for exchange, dividends on newly issued shares of
Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock shall accrue from the most recent
Dividend Payment Date.

 

SECTION 6. _Ranking_. The Redeemable Preferred Stock shall, with respect to
dividends and distributions upon liquidation, winding-up and dissolution of
the Company, rank (a) senior to all classes of Common Stock of the Company,
and to each other class of Capital Stock or series of Preferred Stock of the
Company established after the Issuance Date of the Series A1 Redeemable
Preferred Stock, Series B1 Redeemable Preferred Stock and Series C1
Redeemable Preferred Stock the terms of which expressly provide that it ranks
junior to the Redeemable Preferred Stock as to dividends and distributions
upon liquidation, winding-up and dissolution of the Company (collectively
referred to, together with all classes of Common Stock of the Company, as "
**Junior Securities** "), (b) subject to any required approval of the Holders
in accordance with Section 4(c) hereof, on a parity with each other class of
Capital Stock or series of Preferred Stock established after the Issuance
Date of the Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series B1
Redeemable Preferred Stock and Series C1 Redeemable Preferred Stock the terms
of which expressly provide that such class or series will rank on a parity
with the Redeemable Preferred Stock as to dividends and distributions upon
liquidation, winding-up and dissolution of the Company (collectively referred
to as " **Parity Securities** "), and (c) subject to any required approval
of the Holders in accordance with Section 4(c) hereof, junior to each class
of Capital Stock or series of Preferred Stock established after the Issuance
Date of the Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series B1 Redeemable
Preferred Stock and Series C1 Redeemable Preferred Stock by the Board of
Directors and the terms of which do not expressly provide that such class or
series will rank junior to, or on a parity with, the Redeemable Preferred
Stock as to dividends and distributions upon liquidation, winding-up and
dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to as " **Senior
Securities** "). For the avoidance of doubt, each series of Redeemable
Preferred Stock shall constitute Parity Securities with respect to one
another.

 

SECTION 7. Certain Additional Provisions.

 

(a) _Limitation on Indebtedness_. The Company shall not Incur
any Indebtedness, and the Company shall not permit any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries to Incur any Indebtedness, other than, in any such
case, Permitted Indebtedness; _provided_ that the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness if immediately after giving _pro forma_ __
effect thereto and the use of the proceeds thereof (in accordance with the
definition of "Consolidated Coverage Ratio"), the Consolidated Coverage Ratio
is at least equal to [ ]:1.00. a

  

For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 7(a), (i) in the
event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the
types of Permitted Indebtedness or the provisions of the first paragraph of
this Section 7(a), the Company in its sole discretion may classify, and may
from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required
to include the amount of such Indebtedness as one of such types and such item
of Indebtedness may be divided and classified in more than one of such types,
(ii) the liquidation preference of any Preferred Stock will be the amount of
all obligations of such Person with respect to the redemption of such
Preferred Stock at its stated maturity or upon liquidation or dissolution
(whichever is greater) and (iii) in no event shall the accrual of dividends
or interest or issuance of pay-in-kind dividends or interest subsequent to
the issuance or Incurrence of Indebtedness or Preferred Stock giving rise
thereto constitute an Incurrence required to be tested under this Section
7(a).

  

(b) _Limitations on Restricted Payments_. Without limiting other prohibitions
in this Certificate of Designation (including Sections 4(c) and 5(a)(ii)),
the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
directly or indirectly, (i) declare or pay any dividend or make any
distribution to the holders of any Junior Securities or Parity Securities
(other than dividends or distributions payable solely in shares of Qualified
Capital Stock or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase shares of
Qualified Capital Stock); (ii) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or
retire for value any Junior Securities or Parity Securities or any options,
warrants or other rights to acquire Junior Securities or Parity Securities
(other than

the return of  equity capital, the repayment of the principal of loans or
advances or the  redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted
Subsidiary),  not to exceed, in the case of any Investments in any Person,

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 7(b), for so long as
any Textron Shares remain issued and outstanding, the Company shall not, and
shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly make
any Restricted Payment of the type described in clause (i) or (ii) of the
definition thereof other than (a) Restricted Payments permitted by clauses
(ii), (iii), (iv), (vi), (viii) and (ix) of the preceding paragraph, (b) any
dividend or distribution to Parent to the extent required by Parent to
service Indebtedness owing to any Person that is not an Affiliate of Parent
or the Company if such Restricted Payment would otherwise be permitted by
this Section 7(b), and (c) any dividend or distribution to Parent to the
extent required by Parent in connection with any financing of the Acquisition
in lieu of any of the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), including the Acquisition
Notes and any Refinancing of the Bridge Financing. The provisions of this
paragraph shall operate solely for the benefit of Textron and its
Subsidiaries in their capacity as holders of Textron Shares. Notwithstanding
anything in this Certificate of Designation to the contrary, in the event of
a breach of these provisions and no other provision of this Certificate of
Designation, the sole affected Holders entitled to voting rights under
Section 4 shall be the Holders of the Textron Shares.

 

The amount of any non-cash Restricted Payment shall be the fair market value,
on the date such Restricted Payment is made, of the assets or securities
proposed to be transferred or issued by the Company pursuant to
such Restricted Payment. For the purposes of calculating the aggregate amount
of Restricted Payments made for the purposes of clause (2) of the
first paragraph of this Section 7(b), any payment made pursuant to
clauses (i), (ii), (iv), (v) and, (x) of the second preceding paragraph shall
be included and any payment made pursuant to clauses (iii), (vi), (vii),
(viii) and (ix) of the second preceding paragraph shall be excluded.

 

(c) _Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions
Affecting Subsidiaries_. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause
or suffer to become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on
the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary (i) to pay dividends (in cash or
otherwise) or make any other distributions in respect of its Capital Stock
owned by the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligation owed to the Company or any other Restricted
Subsidiary; (ii) to make loans or advances to the Company or any other
Restricted Subsidiary; or (iii) to transfer any of its property or assets to
the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company may, and may permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
create or otherwise cause or suffer to become effective any such encumbrance
or restriction (A) pursuant to any agreement in effect on the Issuance Date
of the Series A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Series B1
Redeemable Preferred Stock and the Series C1 Redeemable Preferred Stock; (B)
pursuant to the terms of any Credit Facility, Currency Agreement, Interest
Rate Agreement, Commodity Agreement, Receivables Facility or Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to clause (iii) or (iv) of the definition of "Permitted
Indebtedness"; _provided_ that the Company determines in good faith that the
provisions relating to such encumbrance or restriction at the time any such
agreement is entered into (i) are customary in similar agreements entered
into by Persons of a comparable size and credit worthiness to the Company and
(ii) could not reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the
Company's ability to make required cash dividend payments with respect to the
Redeemable Preferred Stock or to redeem the Redeemable Preferred Stock on the
Maturity Redemption Date; (C) pursuant to an agreement existing prior to the
date on which such Person became a Subsidiary of the Company and outstanding
on such date and not created in anticipation of becoming a Subsidiary, which
encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any other Person or the
properties or assets of any other Person; (D) pursuant to an agreement
effecting a renewal, refunding or extension of Indebtedness Incurred or
Preferred Stock issued pursuant to an agreement referred to in clause (A),
(B) or (C) above or this clause (D), _provided_ that the provisions contained
in such renewal, refunding or extension agreement relating to such
encumbrance or restriction are not, in the aggregate, more restrictive in any
material respect than the provisions contained in the agreement the subject
thereof, as determined in good faith by the Company; (E) in the case of
clause (iii) above, restrictions contained in any mortgage, security or lease
agreement (including a capital or operating lease) securing Indebtedness of a
Subsidiary or relating to property or assets of a Subsidiary otherwise
permitted hereunder, but only to the extent such restrictions restrict the
transfer of the property or asset subject to such mortgage, security or lease
agreement; (F) in the case of clause (iii) above, customary nonassignment
provisions entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice in leases and other contracts to the extent such provisions
restrict the transfer or subletting of any such lease or the assignment of
rights under such contract; (G) any restriction with respect to a Subsidiary
of the Company imposed pursuant to an agreement which has been entered into
for the sale or disposition of Capital Stock or assets of such Subsidiary;
(H) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Foreign Subsidiary
pursuant to an agreement relating to Indebtedness or Liens Incurred by such
Foreign Subsidiary which is permitted hereunder; _provided_ , that the
Company determines in good faith that the provisions relating to such
encumbrance or restriction at the time any such agreement is entered into (i)
are customary in similar agreement entered into by persons of a comparable
size and credit worthiness to the Company and (ii) could not reasonably be
expected to materially adversely affect the Company's ability to make
required cash dividend payments with respect to the Redeemable Preferred
Stock or to redeem the Redeemable Preferred Stock on the Maturity Redemption
Date; or (I) any encumbrance or restriction which by its terms permits
payments to the Company to the extent needed to pay dividends on any Dividend
Payment Date or as otherwise required hereunder.

 

(d) _Textron Share Liquidity Provisions_. The provisions of this Section 7(d)
are solely for the benefit of Holders of Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock
that constitute Textron Shares. In the event that either (I) both (A) the
Liquidity Condition is satisfied at any time and (B) no Par Offer has been
properly made on or before the First Dividend Payment Date and all Textron
Shares purchased pursuant thereto or (II) both (A) the Existing Notes are
repaid at or within 180 days of their final Stated Maturity and (B) no Par
Offer has been properly made on or before such repayment, the Series A
Dividend Rate applicable solely to Textron Shares will increase by 1.00% per
annum for the first dividend period commencing on the first day after the
First Dividend Payment Date and by an additional 0.50% per annum for each
dividend period thereafter; _provided_ that (1) the Series A Dividend Rate
applicable to Textron Shares in effect at any time shall not exceed 20%
per annum and (2) the Series A Dividend Rate will return to the Dividend
Rate otherwise applicable under Section 2(a) once a Par Offer has been
properly made and all Textron Shares purchased pursuant thereto. The period
during which the increased Series A Dividend Rate in respect of Textron
Shares shall be in effect under the immediately preceding sentence
is referred to herein as the "Restricted Period." During the
Restricted Period, if any, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall
not Incur any Indebtedness (other than Permitted Restricted Period Debt or
Indebtedness Incurred for the purpose financing a Par Offer) unless the
Consolidated Coverage Ratio (or, if there has been an Asset Acquisition after
the Issuance Date of the Series A1 Preferred Stock, the Adjusted Consolidated
Pro Forma Coverage Ratio) after giving effect to the Incurrence of such
Indebtedness is equal to or greater than the ratios specified below for the
four fiscal quarter periods ending when specified below:

 

      

Periods ending on or prior to December 31, 2002  |  

3.00:1.0  
---|--- 
     

Periods ending on or between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2003  |  


  3.25:1.0  
     

Periods ending on and after January 1, 2004  |  

3.50:1.0.  
   

For so long as there are any issued and outstanding Textron Shares,
the Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
refinance, repay, retire or defease Existing Notes (other than at or within
180 days prior to their final Stated Maturity) in an aggregate principal
amount greater than $25 million, unless prior to or concurrently therewith a
Par Offer shall have been made. Notwithstanding the Company's obligations to
pay Liquidity Dividends as provided in this Section 7(d) to the Holders of
Textron Shares, the Company shall not be required to make a Par Offer
unless (i) all Existing Notes shall have ceased to be outstanding, (ii) the
Company shall have consummated a defeasance with respect to the Existing
Notes in accordance with the terms thereof or (iii) the holders of Existing
Notes shall have consented to the making of such Par Offer.

 

For so long as there are any issued and outstanding Textron Shares, within
60 days after an Asset Acquisition occurring following the Issuance Date of
the Series A1 Preferred Stock and prior to a Par Offer, the Company
shall deliver a certificate of its Chief Financial Officer to the Holders of
Textron Shares certifying that attached five full fiscal year "stand
alone" projections (the " **Certified Projections** ") of Consolidated
Cash Flow and Consolidated Interest Expense for the Persons or assets
acquired pursuant to such Asset Acquisition (assuming for the purposes of
such projections that such Persons or assets are the "Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries" and disregarding clause (viii) of the definition
of Consolidated Interest Expense) are (1) projections that are
utilizing consistent operating assumptions with any projections delivered to
lenders to the Company in connection with the particular Asset Acquisition
(it being agreed that the Certified Projections are "stand alone" projections
and will accordingly give no effect to any impact of combining or integrating
the acquired Person or assets with the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries) or (2) in the absence of the projections referred to in the
preceding clause (1), the projections utilized by the Board of Directors of
the Company (or any duly authorized Committee thereof) in approving the
particular Asset Acquisition. Such Certified Projections may include a
prospective reasonable methodology for allocating the indicated Consolidated
Cash Flow and Consolidated Interest Expense across quarters for the entire
period covered by the Certified Projections.

 

The benefit of the provisions of this Section 7(d) are solely intended
for Textron and its Subsidiaries and shall terminate as to any shares
of Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock that are transferred or
otherwise disposed of to any other Person, regardless of their subsequent
reacquisition by Textron or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

In the event of any transfer of Textron Shares to a Person other than
Textron or its Subsidiaries (a " **Non -Textron Transferee**"),
if immediately prior to such transfer there shall exist Total Liquidity
Dividends in Arrears with respect to such Textron Shares, then immediately
following such transfer such Total Liquidity Dividends in Arrears shall cease
to exist with respect to such transferred Textron Shares (the " **Transferred
Shares** ") and the Transferred Shares shall be for all purposes shares of
Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock not entitled to any of the benefits
afforded to Textron Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, but without
limitation, the Transferred Shares shall have a Liquidation Preference and be
entitled to Total Cash Dividends in Arrears, if any, as if such shares (or
any predecessor shares) had never been Textron Shares. As promptly as
practicable following a written notice of a transfer of Textron Shares to a
Non-Textron Transferee, the Company shall issue to such Non-Textron
Transferee additional shares of Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock identical
to the Transferred Shares in all respects (including, without limitation, as
to Liquidation Preference, Total Cash Dividends in Arrears, if any, and
accrued regular dividends), with the number of such newly issued shares being
equal to (x) the Total Liquidity Dividends in Arrears formerly applicable to
the Transferred Shares, divided by (y) the Liquidation Preference plus Total
Cash Dividends in Arrears (inclusive of Additional Dividends accruing from
the most recent Dividend Payment Date) plus accrued regular dividends from
the most recent Dividend Payment Date in respect of each share of newly
issued Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock as of its date of issuance. In
lieu of any issuing any fractional shares of Series A Redeemable Preferred
Stock, the Company may deliver to a Non-Textron Transferee an amount in cash
equal to such fraction multiplied by the amount set forth in clause (y) of
the preceding sentence. The Company may require reasonable certifications and
indemnities from Textron and/or any Non-Textron Transferee concerning the
transfer of Textron Shares as a condition to issuing additional shares of
Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock (or cash payments in respect of
fractional shares) as contemplated by this paragraph.

 

(e) _Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets_. The Company shall not, in a
single transaction or through a series of transactions, consolidate with
or merge with or into any other Person or sell, assign, convey, transfer,
lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any other Person or Persons or permit any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to enter into any such transaction or series of transactions if
such transaction or series of transactions, in the aggregate, would result in
the sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition of all
or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis to any other Person or
Persons, unless at the time and immediately after giving effect thereto:

 

(i) ** **either (a) the Company shall be the continuing corporation or (b)
the Person (if other than the Company) formed by such consolidation or into
which the Company or such Subsidiary is merged or the Person that acquires by
sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or disposition all or
substantially all the properties and assets of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (the " **Surviving Entity** ") shall be
a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the
United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

  ** 

**(ii) ** **the Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be converted into or
exchanged for and shall become shares of the Surviving Entity having in
respect of the Surviving Entity the same rights and privileges that the
Redeemable Preferred Stock had immediately prior to such transaction or
series of transactions with respect to the Company;

  ** 

**(iii) ** **no Voting Rights Triggering Event shall have occurred and be
continuing; and

  ** 

**(iv) ** **after giving effect to such transaction or series of
transactions, the Consolidated Coverage Ratio shall be equal to or greater
than [ ]:1.00. a

  

Any Surviving Entity shall file **** an appropriate certificate
of designation with respect to the preferred stock referred to in clause
(ii) above with the Secretary of State (or similar public official) of the
jurisdiction under whose laws it is organized. In such event, the Company
shall be released from its obligations under this Certificate of Designation.

 

(f) _Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates_. The Company shall not, and
shall not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or

recurring and customary fees and expenses related to any issue of Capital
Stock, Incurrence of Indebtedness or other financing transaction; and (viii)
lease payments, or the functional equivalent thereof (including payments of
principal and interest in connection with any synthetic lease arrangement
or similar financing arrangement), relating to the real property and
equipment initially subject to the transaction described in Section 5.21 of
the Purchase Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the consolidated
income tax expense, depreciation expense and amortization expense of a

Subsidiary was included in calculating Consolidated Net Income.

the sum of (x) Consolidated Interest Expense, plus (y) the implied interest
component of any payments of the type described in clause (viii) of the
definition of Consolidated Cash Flow, in each case for such four fiscal
quarters; _provided_ that (1) if the Company or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries has Incurred any Indebtedness since the beginning of such period
through the date of determination of the Consolidated Coverage Ratio that
remains outstanding or if the transaction giving rise to the need to
calculate Consolidated Coverage Ratio is an incurrence of Indebtedness,
Consolidated Cash Flow and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period
shall be calculated after giving effect on a _pro forma_ __ basis to (A) such
Indebtedness ( _provided_ that, if such Indebtedness is Incurred under a
revolving credit facility (or similar arrangement or under any predecessor
revolving credit or similar arrangement), only that portion of such
Indebtedness that constitutes the one year projected average balance of such
Indebtedness (as determined in good faith by senior management of the
Company) shall be deemed outstanding for purposes of this calculation) and
(B) the discharge of any other Indebtedness repaid, repurchased, defeased or
otherwise discharged with the proceeds of such new Indebtedness as if such
discharge had occurred on the first day of such period, (2) if since the
beginning of such period any Indebtedness of the Company or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries has been repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise
discharged (other than Indebtedness under a revolving credit or similar
arrangement unless such revolving credit Indebtedness has been permanently
repaid and has not been replaced), Consolidated Interest Expense for such
period shall be calculated after giving _pro forma_ __ effect thereto as if
such Indebtedness had been repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise
discharged on the first day of such period, (3) if since the beginning of
such period the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries shall have made
any Asset Disposition or if the transaction giving rise to the need
to calculate the Consolidated Coverage Ratio involves an Asset
Disposition, Consolidated Cash Flow for such period shall be reduced by an
amount equal to the Consolidated Cash Flow (if positive) attributable to the
assets which are the subject of such Asset Disposition for such period or
increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated Cash Flow (if negative)
attributable thereto for such period, and Consolidated Interest Expense for
such period shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated Interest
Expense attributable to any Indebtedness of the Company or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged
with respect to the Company and its continuing Restricted Subsidiaries in
connection with such Asset Disposition for such period (or, if the Capital
Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company is sold, transferred or
otherwise disposed of, the Consolidated Interest Expense for such period
directly attributable to the Indebtedness of such Restricted Subsidiary to
the extent the Company and the continuing Restricted Subsidiaries are no
longer liable for such Indebtedness after such sale, transfer or other
disposition), (4) if since the beginning of such period the Company or any of
the Restricted Subsidiaries (by merger or otherwise) shall have made an Asset
Acquisition, Consolidated Cash Flow and Consolidated Interest Expense for
such period shall be calculated after giving _pro forma_ __ effect thereto
(including the incurrence of any Indebtedness) as if such Asset Acquisition
occurred on the first day of such period and (5) if since the beginning of
such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or
was merged with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary since the
beginning of such period shall have made any Asset Disposition or Asset
Acquisition that would have required an adjustment pursuant to clause (3) or
(4) above if made by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary during such
period, Consolidated Cash Flow and Consolidated Interest Expense for such
period shall be calculated after giving _pro forma_ __ effect thereto as if
such Asset Disposition or Asset Acquisition occurred on the first day of such
period. For purposes of this definition, whenever _pro forma_ __ effect is to
be given to an Asset Acquisition, the amount of income or earnings relating
thereto and the amount of Consolidated Interest Expense associated with any
Indebtedness Incurred in connection therewith, the _pro forma_ __
calculations shall be determined in good faith by the Company. If any
Indebtedness or Preferred Stock bears a floating rate of interest or
dividends and is being given _pro forma_ _ _ effect, the interest expense on
such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of
determination had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into
account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to any such Indebtedness if
such Interest Rate Agreement has a remaining term that extends at least until
the end of such period). a

paid by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary under any guarantee of
Indebtedness or other obligation of any other Person, and (vii) net payments
(whether positive or negative) pursuant to Interest Rate Agreements and, to
the extent related to Indebtedness, Currency Agreements. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, consolidated interest expense and the other items referred to in

to the extent (and in the same proportion) that the net income of such
Subsidiary was included in calculating Consolidated Interest Expense.

 

" **Consolidated Net Income** " means, for any period, the net income (loss)
of the Company and the consolidated Restricted Subsidiaries for such period
determined in accordance with GAAP; _provided_ , _however_ , that there shall

realized upon the sale or other disposition of any assets of the Company or
the Restricted Subsidiaries (including pursuant to any sale/leaseback
transaction) which are not sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary
course of business and any gain or loss realized upon the sale or
