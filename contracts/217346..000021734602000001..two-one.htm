<p>(a) As soon as practicable, but in any event not more than 70 days after the
Closing Date, unless otherwise extended by the mutual agreement of Parent and
Holdings, Parent shall deliver to Holdings a statement of net assets to be sold
as of the Closing Date, including information necessary to determine the Working
Capital, Balance Sheet Indebtedness and Closing Cash at such date (but without
giving effect to the Closing and the transactions covered by the Asset Purchase
Agreement specified in Section 2.2(b)) (the &quot;Closing Financial
Statement&quot;), together with a report of E&Y thereon to the effect that
such statement fairly presents in all material respects the financial position
of the Bison Subsidiaries as of said date, and that such statement has been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the December
30, 2000 Statement of Net Assets to be Sold (including the elimination of the
corporate overhead items identified in Part B of Section 3.4 of the Disclosure
Schedule but except that M&C Advanced Processes is included in the Closing
Financial Statements), except (i) for any accounting changes mandated by
accounting regulators and (ii) as set forth in Part A of Section 3.4 of the
Disclosure Schedule. All costs and expenses incurred by Parent in connection
with the preparation and delivery of the Closing Financial Statement shall be
borne equally by Parent and Holdings.</p>
<p>(b) Subject to Section 2.4(e), if Working Capital plus Balance Sheet
Indebtedness on the Closing Date is less than negative one hundred eight million
nine hundred thousand dollars ($&#45;108,900,000), the difference between
Working Capital plus Balance Sheet Indebtedness and negative $108,900,000 shall
be paid by Parent to C&A Products. Subject to Section 2.4(e), if Working
Capital plus Balance Sheet Indebtedness on the Closing Date is more than
negative one hundred eight million nine hundred thousand dollars
($&#45;108,900,000), the difference between Working Capital plus Balance
Sheet Indebtedness and negative $108,900,000 shall be paid by C&A Products
to Parent. For the purposes of calculating the purchase price adjustment set
forth in this section, Balance Sheet Indebtedness shall be deemed to be a
negative number.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) Subject to Section 2.4(e), if the Closing Cash on the Closing Date is
    greater than zero, the difference between zero and the Closing Cash shall be
    paid by C&A Products to Parent. Subject to Section 2.4(e), if the
    Closing Cash on the Closing Date is less than zero, the difference between
    zero and the Closing Cash shall be paid by Parent to C&A Products. If
    the Closing Cash on the Closing Date of any Bison Subsidiary incorporated in
    a jurisdiction other than a state of the United States of America is greater
    than the sum of payments to employees and suppliers during the last two
    fiscal months ended prior to the Closing Date (the &quot;Two&#45;Month
    Cash Amount&quot;), then the amount payable to Parent pursuant to the first
    sentence of Section 2.4(c) shall be reduced by the amount of the Closing
    Cash on the Closing Date of the applicable Subsidiary which is in excess of
    the Two&#45;Month Cash Amount multiplied by the withholding Tax rate
    applicable to dividends paid by the applicable Bison Subsidiary; <u>provided</u>
    that during such two&#45;month period payments to employees and
    suppliers shall be made consistent with past practice.</p>
    <p>(ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Subject to Section
    2.4(e), if the Closing has not occurred prior to the Capital Expenditure
    Date, C&A Products will pay Parent any amount by which capital
    expenditures for assets not recorded on the financial statements prior to
    the Capital Expenditure Date during the period beginning on the Capital
    Expenditure Date and ending on the Closing Date (excluding capital
    expenditures made by THI and its Subsidiaries) exceed depreciation
    attributable to the Business during that period (excluding depreciation
    attributable to THI and its Subsidiaries). No later than the delivery of the
    Closing Financial Statement, Parent shall deliver a certificate of its Chief
    Financial Officer certifying to the amount payable, if any, pursuant to this
    section. The term &quot;Capital Expenditure Date&quot; shall mean October 1,

    required to be delivered to C&A Products pursuant to Section 5.9(a), are
    not delivered by August 31, 2001, the Capital Expenditure Date shall be
    extended by the number of days by which the deadline is not met.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(d) Subject to Section 2.4(e), payments required pursuant to Section 2.4(b)
and 2.4(c)(i) shall be made within 60 days after the date of receipt by Holdings
of the Closing Financial Statement, and payments required pursuant to Section
2.4(c)(ii) shall be made 180 days after the Closing Date (or, if such day is not
a business day, on the next succeeding business day). Payments shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts specified
at least two business days prior to such date by the party who shall receive the
funds. Any such payment shall be made together with interest thereon at the
Interest Rate, payable for the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending
on the day immediately prior to the date such payment is made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(e) Holdings may dispute any amounts used in the calculation of the purchase
price adjustment pursuant to Sections 2.4(b) or 2.4(c)(i) as reflected on the
Closing Financial Statement or the purchase price adjustment pursuant to Section
2.4(c)(ii) that involves a proposed adjustment with respect to any single item
of more than $50,000 but only to the extent that proposed adjustments exceeding
$50,000 exceed, in the aggregate, $500,000; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
that Holdings shall notify Parent in writing (the &quot;Dispute Notice&quot;) of
each disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in dispute and setting forth,
in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute, within 45 days of
Holdings&#39; receipt of the Closing Financial Statement; <u>provided</u> <u>further</u>,
<u>however</u>, that if an account or item is recorded or treated in a manner
consistent with past practice and, if applicable, with the December 30, 2000
Statement of Net Assets to be Sold, then, provided that such recording or
treatment does not prevent the Closing Financial Statement from being in
accordance with GAAP,<b> </b>it must be accepted as correct by Holdings for
purposes of this Section 2.4. Holdings shall submit only one Dispute Notice
containing all disputed items. In the event of such a dispute, Holdings and
Parent shall attempt to reconcile their difference, and any resolution by them
as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive. If Holdings
and Parent are unable to reach a resolution with such effect within 30 days of
the receipt by Parent of the Dispute Notice, Holdings and Parent shall submit
the items remaining in dispute for resolution to the Independent Accounting Firm
which shall, within 30 days after submission, determine and report to the
parties upon such remaining disputed items, and such report shall be final,
binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. All costs and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm relating to the disputed items shall be allocated
between Parent and Holdings in the same proportion that the aggregate dollar
amount of the items unsuccessfully disputed by each party bears to the total
dollar amount of the items disputed under such notice. The term
&quot;Independent Accounting Firm&quot; shall mean Deloitte & Touche LLP or
such other firm as Holdings and Parent shall agree.</p>
<p>(f) Notwithstanding any dispute pursuant to Section 2.4(e) of any amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 2.4, the applicable party shall at the time
specified in Section 2.4 pay that portion of the amounts payable by it pursuant
to this Section 2.4 that are not subject at the time of such payment to any
dispute. Any amount payable following resolution of a matter specified in a
Dispute Notice shall be paid within five (5) business days following the
resolution thereof.</p>
<p>(g) During the periods in which (i) the Closing Financial Statement is being
prepared or (ii) any dispute is raised as contemplated by Section 2.4(e), Parent
and Holdings shall provide each other, including their Representatives, with
reasonable access, during normal business hours and without disruption to their
day&#45;to&#45;day business, to their respective books, records and
facilities pertaining to the Bison Subsidiaries and the Transactions to the
extent affecting the Bison Subsidiaries, including any consolidated or combined
returns, schedules, consolidated or combined work papers and other related
documents; <u>provided</u>, however, that with respect to consolidated,
combined, unitary or similar Tax Returns which include Parent (or any Subsidiary
of Parent, other than a Bison Subsidiary (a &quot;Non&#45;Bison
Subsidiary&quot;)) on the one hand and any of the Bison Subsidiaries on the
other hand, Holdings shall only have access to portions of such Tax Returns

<p>2.5 </a><a NAME="_Toc532024464"><u>Allocation of Consideration; Tax Filings</u>.</a></p>
<p>(a) The consideration attributable to the purchase of the Directly Purchased
Subsidiaries, including the sales proceeds resulting from the transactions
specified in Section 5.21 and the present value of the Earn&#45;Out Amount
specified in Section 2.8, shall be allocated among the Shares as set forth in
Schedule D hereto. Within 30 days after the determination of the adjustments
pursuant to Section 2.4 and any adjustments accounting for the sale proceeds
resulting from the transactions specified in Section 5.21, Parent shall deliver
to Holdings a schedule (the &quot;Adjustment Schedule&quot;) allocating said
adjustments among the Shares, and also accounting for any difference between the
Balance Sheet Indebtedness of the Bison Subsidiaries existing on the Closing
Date and $76,900,000, in a manner consistent with the allocation methodology
used in determining the allocation set forth in Schedule D.</p>
<p>(b) Holdings may dispute any allocation set forth on the Adjustment Schedule;
provided, however, that (i) Holdings shall not dispute any of the original
allocations set forth in Schedule D and (ii) Holdings shall notify Parent in
writing (the &quot;Allocation Dispute Notice&quot;) of each disputed item,
specifying the allocation in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail,
the basis for such dispute within 30 days of Holdings&#39; receipt of the
schedule. Holdings shall submit only one Allocation Dispute Notice containing
all disputed allocations. In the event of such a dispute, Holdings and Parent
shall attempt to reconcile their differences and any resolution by them as to
any disputed allocations shall be final, binding and conclusive. If Holdings and
Parent are unable to reach a resolution with such effect within 30 days of the
receipt by Parent of the Allocation Dispute Notice, Holdings and Parent shall
submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to the Independent
Accounting Firm which shall, within 30 days after submission, determine and
report to the parties upon such remaining disputed allocations, and such report
shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. All costs and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm relating to the disputed allocations
shall be borne equally by Parent and Holdings; provided, however, that if the
Independent Accounting Firm determines that the position asserted by one of the
parties in such dispute is substantially in error, then all such costs and
expenses shall be borne by the party so determined to be in error.</p>
<p>(c) Upon agreement of the parties with respect to the Adjustment Schedule, or
the completion of a report prepared by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant
to Section 2.5(b), a schedule (the &quot;Final Allocation Schedule&quot;)
setting forth the allocation among the Shares as specified in Section 2.5(a) and
modified pursuant to Section 2.5(b) shall be prepared by the parties. Each of
Holdings and Parent shall (i) timely file with each relevant Tax Authority all
forms and Tax Returns required to be filed in connection with the allocation set
forth in the Final Allocation Schedule, (ii) be bound by such allocation for
purposes of determining Taxes, (iii) prepare and file, and cause their
respective Affiliates to prepare and file, their Tax Returns on a basis
consistent with such allocation, and (iv) not take any position, or cause their
respective Affiliates to take any position, inconsistent with such allocation on
any Tax Return, in any audit or proceeding before any Tax Authority or in any
report made for Tax purposes; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything
in this Section 2.5 to the contrary, (i) the parties shall be permitted to take
a position inconsistent with that set forth in this Section 2.5 if required to
do so by a final and unappealable decision, judgment, decree or other order by
any court of competent jurisdiction, and (ii) with respect to any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent, Holdings or C&A
Products may pursue a pre&#45;filing agreement in accordance with Revenue
Procedure 2001&#45;22 (or any successor pronouncement), and upon the request
of the party pursuing a pre&#45;filing agreement the other parties shall

cooperation and assistance in obtaining any such pre&#45;filing agreement.</p>

<p>(a) If the aggregate EBITDA, as defined below, of Holdings for the five
fiscal years ending December 31, 2006 equals or exceeds two billion nine hundred
eight million dollars ($2,908,000,000), then C&A Products and/or any of its
Subsidiaries shall pay Parent and/or designated Subsidiaries of Parent the
earn&#45;out amount specified in Schedule G hereto (the
&quot;Earn&#45;Out Amount&quot;). Earn&#45;Out Amounts between the fixed
points including and in excess of three billion two hundred ninety seven million
dollars ($3,297,000,000) in the column on Schedule G entitled
&quot;5&#45;Year Cumulative EBITDA&quot; shall be determined by
interpolation. The term &quot;EBITDA&quot; shall mean (i) the Consolidated Cash
Flow, minus Projected Time Adjusted Acquisition Cash Flow (excluding any
Consolidated Cash Flow attributable to any Receivables Financing Subsidiary),
provided that (A) the term &quot;EBITDA&quot; shall be substituted for the term
&quot;Adjusted Consolidated Pro Forma Coverage Ratio&quot; in the applicable
definitions, (B) the term &quot;consolidated Subsidiary&quot; shall be
substituted for the term &quot;Restricted Subsidiary&quot; in the applicable
definitions, (C) any net income or loss described in section (vi) of the
definition of Consolidated Net Income shall be included in the calculation of
Consolidated Net Income and (D) lease payments, or the functional equivalent
thereof (including payments of principal and interest in connection with any
synthetic lease arrangement or similar financing arrangement), relating to the
equipment initially subject to the transaction described in Section 5.21 shall
be added to Consolidated Cash Flow to the extent such payments were deducted in
computing Consolidated Net Income, <u>plus</u> (ii) to the extent that it is not
included in the calculation of Consolidated Cash Flow pursuant to (i), (x) the
Consolidated Cash Flow minus Projected Time Adjusted Acquisition Cash Flow, but
substituting the term &quot;Textron Automotive Holdings Italy S.r.l.&quot; for
the term &quot;Company&quot; and deleting the term &quot;Restricted
Subsidiary&quot; in all applicable definitions, and (y) discounts and interest
relating to factoring. (Capitalized terms in the immediately preceding sentence
shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Certificate of Designation.) All
claims to Earn&#45;Out Amounts are subordinate to any amounts due under the
financings described in the Debt Commitment Letter.</p>
<font FACE="Courier New">
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  </font>
  <p>(i) Within 120 days after the end of each of the five fiscal years ending
  on December 31, 2006, Holdings shall deliver to Parent audited financial
  statements of Holdings and its consolidated Subsidiaries, including a balance
  sheet as at the end of the applicable fiscal year and statements of income and
  cash flows for the respective twelve month period then ended. The financial
  statements shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by the President and
  the Chief Financial Officer of Holdings setting forth in reasonable detail the
  computation of EBITDA for the year then ended. Holdings shall promptly give
  Parent access to documents and other information reasonably requested by
  Parent for the purpose of assessing the accuracy of the EBITDA calculation.</p>
  <p>(ii) Within 60 days of any Asset Acquisition (as defined in the Certificate
  of Designation) occurring following the Closing Date and prior to December 31,
  2006, Holdings shall deliver a certificate of its Chief Financial Officer to
  Parent as to the related Certified Projections (as defined in the Certificate
  of Designation), prepared on the basis set forth in the Certificate of
  Designation, for the purpose of future calculations of EBITDA as set forth
  above.</p>
  <font FACE="Courier New">
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
</font>
<p>(b) Parent may dispute the calculation of EBITDA (but not the applicable
Certified Projections) with respect to any year by delivering a notice to
Holdings within 45 days after receiving the EBITDA certification specified above
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, which notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the basis for the dispute. If the parties are unable to
resolve the dispute within 30 days after delivery of the aforesaid notice, the
matter shall be submitted for resolution by the Independent Accounting Firm
which shall, within 30 days after submission, determine and report to the
parties upon the disputed items, and such report shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties hereto. All costs and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Parent and Holdings in the same
proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of the items unsuccessfully disputed
by each party bears to the total dollar amount of the items disputed under such
notice. Subject to Section 2.8(e), any amount payable to Parent shall be paid
within five (5) business days following the resolution of the dispute.</p>
<p>(c) Subject to Section 2.8(d) and completion of the dispute resolution
mechanism referred to in Section 2.8(b), the Earn&#45;Out Amount shall be
paid on or before 180 days after delivery of the financial statements and EBITDA
certification specified in Section 2.8(a) for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2006. The Earn&#45;Out Amount shall be paid in immediately available funds
by wire transfer to one or more accounts specified by Parent at least two
business days prior to the payment date.</p>
<p>(d) Holdings will use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate debt
covenants in instruments governing Indebtedness of Holdings and its Subsidiaries
that are customary for companies with its credit ratings and credit statistics
and the type of financing involved. In the event that payment of the
Earn&#45;Out Amount would cause Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries to be in
breach of any agreement or instrument governing Indebtedness involving a
principal amount, individually or in the aggregate, of $5.0&#160;million or
more (a &quot;Material Breach&quot;), C&A Products (or, in the event the
issuer of the other series of Preferred Stock is Holdings, Holdings) will be
permitted to issue shares of Series B Preferred Stock or, if permitted by the
terms of Section 1(c) of the Certificate of Designation, another series of
Preferred Stock with terms identical to the Series B Preferred Stock, other than
that (a) it may be optionally redeemed at any time at a redemption price equal
to its Liquidation Preference, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends,
(b)&#160;it must be mandatorily redeemed as set forth below at a redemption
price equal to its Liquidation Preference, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends
and (c) it must be convertible from time to time at the option of the holder, in
whole or in part, into shares of Series B Preferred Stock, if such shares of
Series B Preferred Stock will be fungible with any outstanding shares of Series
B Preferred Stock from a Tax perspective, provided, that Preferred Stock will be
issued only to the extent necessary to avoid any such breach; <u>provided</u>, <u>further</u>,
<u>however</u>, that the terms requiring a mandatory redemption shall only be
required to be included in such Preferred Stock to the extent that doing so
itself would not cause a Material Breach. The Liquidation Preference and, if
applicable, related accrued and compounded dividends (all calculated as set
forth in the Certificate of Designation) of the shares of Preferred Stock issued
in lieu of payment of the Earn&#45;Out Amount will be equal to that of the
Earn&#45;Out Amount not paid in cash. Holdings and C&A Products hereby
agree that following the issuance of any Preferred Stock in lieu of payment of
the Earn&#45;Out Amount in cash, the issuer thereof is obligated, within 30
days following any date upon which it would be permitted to redeem all or any
portion of such Preferred Stock without causing a Material Breach, to do so,
whether in one instance or as permitted from time to time.</p>
<p>(e) For purposes of computing the amount of consideration attributable to the
purchase of the Directly Purchased Subsidiaries under Section 2.5, the present
value of the Earn&#45;Out Amount shall be thirty eight million dollars
($38,000,000). Within 45 days of the payment of the Earn&#45;Out Amount by
Holdings pursuant to this Section 2.8, Parent shall provide Holdings with an
accounting of the payment, for Tax purposes, setting forth the amount of the
payment that constitutes interest and the amount of the payment that constitutes
principal, computed in accordance with the principles of Section 483 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Holdings may dispute any
portion of the accounting. In the event of such a dispute, Holdings and Parent
shall attempt to reconcile their differences in accordance with the dispute
resolution procedures set forth in Section 2.5(b). Each of Holdings and Parent
shall (i) timely file with each relevant Tax Authority all forms and Tax Returns
required to be filed in connection with such accounting, (ii) be bound by such
filings, (iii) prepare and file, and cause their respective Affiliates to
prepare and file, their Tax Returns on a basis consistent with such accounting
and (iv) not take any position, or cause their respective Affiliates to take any
position, inconsistent with such accounting on any Tax Return, in any audit or
proceeding before any Tax Authority or in any report made for Tax purposes, <u>provided</u>,
<u>however</u>, that, notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.8 to the
contrary, the parties shall be permitted to take a position inconsistent with
that set forth in this Section 2.8 if required to do so by a final and
unappealable decision, judgment, decree or other order by any court of competent
jurisdiction or Taxing Authority provided further however notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section&#160;2.8(e), if a party reasonably
expects that a failure to do so will subject that party to penalties, that party
is permitted to take positions inconsistent with that set forth in this
Section&#160;2.8.</p>

<p>Parent represents and warrants to Holdings and C&A Products, subject to
the exceptions set forth in the Disclosure Schedule (which exceptions shall
specifically identify a Section to which such exception relates, it being
understood and agreed that each such exception shall be deemed to be disclosed
both under such Section and any other Section to which such disclosure on its
face relates), that:</p>

Organization, Qualification, Power and Authority</u>.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) Parent and each of the Bison Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing (where applicable) under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. Each of the Bison Subsidiaries is
qualified and in good standing (where applicable) as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction where the properties owned, leased or operated, or the
business conducted, by it requires such qualification, except where any failure
to be so qualified or be in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Bison Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate power and corporate authority and
all necessary Permits to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted, except where any failure to have such
power and authority or Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Parent has or will have
made available to Holdings prior to the Closing complete and correct copies of
the articles of organization or articles of or certificates of incorporation, as
the case may be, and by&#45;laws or other equivalent organizational
documents of it and each Bison Subsidiary as in effect as of the date hereof.</p>
<p>(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries have the requisite corporate power and
corporate authority to execute and deliver the Transaction Agreements (to the
extent each is a party thereto) and to consummate the transactions contemplated
thereby. The Transaction Agreements and the consummation by Parent and said
Subsidiaries of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly and validly
authorized by the Boards of Directors of Parent and Textron Automotive Company
Inc., and the general partner of Textron Innovations L.P. (to the extent each is
a party thereto), and no other corporate proceeding on the part of Parent or its
Subsidiaries is necessary to authorize the Transaction Agreements or to
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. On the Closing Date, Parent
and the Subsidiaries of Parent will have the requisite corporate power and
corporate authority to execute and deliver the Italian JV Documents and the
Leasing Documents (to the extent each is a party thereto). This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and, assuming this
Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of Holdings and C&A
Products, constitutes the valid and binding agreement of Parent, enforceable
against Parent in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be
limited by (a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws now or hereinafter in effect
relating to or affecting creditors&#39; rights generally and (b) general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law). When executed and delivered to Holdings and
C&A Products at the Closing, the Transaction Agreements (other than this
Agreement), the Italian JV Documents and the Leasing Documents will be duly and
validly executed and delivered by Parent and its Subsidiaries (to the extent
each is a party thereto) and, assuming such agreements constitute the valid and
binding agreements of the other parties thereto, constitute the valid and
binding agreements of Parent and its Subsidiaries (to the extent each is a party
thereto), enforceable against Parent and said Subsidiaries, in accordance with
their terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by (a) applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws now or hereinafter in effect relating to or affecting
creditors&#39; rights generally and (b) general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or

<p>(a) Schedule B to this Agreement identifies each entity that will be a
Subsidiary of the Directly Purchased Subsidiaries on the Closing Date. As of the
Closing Date, the Directly Purchased Subsidiaries will not own, directly or
indirectly, any equity interests in any other Person.</p>
<p>(b) All of the shares of capital stock of the Directly Purchased
Subsidiaries, except for any directors&#39; qualifying shares, are owned by
Parent or one or more of its Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens (without
regard to subsections (i) through (iv) of the proviso in the definition of
&quot;Liens&quot;), and have been duly authorized, validly issued and are fully
paid and nonassessable and were not issued in violation of any preemptive or
similar rights. Except for any director&#39;s qualifying shares and except
as otherwise set forth on Schedule B, all of the shares of capital stock of the
Subsidiaries listed on Schedule B will, as of the Closing Date, be owned by one
or more of the other Bison Subsidiaries as set forth on Schedule B, free and
clear of all Liens (without regard to subsections (i) through (iv) of the
proviso in the definition of &quot;Liens&quot;), and said shares, together with
the outstanding common stock of Textron Automotive Exteriors Inc., have been
duly authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and were
not issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights, except for any
Liens or where any failure to be duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid
or nonassessable would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.</p>
<p>(c) There are no options, warrants, convertible securities or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments relating to the capital stock of, or
other equity interest in, any Bison Subsidiary obligating Parent or any Bison
Subsidiary to issue, sell, transfer, vote or otherwise dispose of or sell any

obligating Parent or any Bison Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any
such option, warrant, convertible security or other right, agreement,

<p>.</p>
<p>(a) A &quot;Bison Plan&quot; shall mean any (i) &quot;welfare&quot; plan,
fund or program (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&quot;ERISA&quot;)) and any comparable
foreign plan; (ii) &quot;pension&quot; plan, fund or program (within the meaning
of Section 3(2) of ERISA) and any comparable foreign plan; (iii) deferred

or severance agreement with any officer of a Directly Purchased Subsidiary whose
principal office is located in the United States other than officers who are
employed by a Non&#45;Bison Subsidiary; (v) stock bonus, stock option,
restricted stock, stock appreciation right, stock purchase, bonus, severance or

programs, in each case, that are sponsored or maintained by or contributed to or

whether or not incorporated (an &quot;ERISA Affiliate&quot;), that together with
a Bison Subsidiary would be deemed a &quot;single employer&quot; within the
meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA or to which a Bison Subsidiary or an ERISA
Affiliate is party, for the benefit of any employee or former employee of a
Bison Subsidiary (or of Textron Automotive Company Inc. if such person&#39;s
entire salary was directly charged to the Business), or with respect to which a
Bison Subsidiary could incur liability and any comparable foreign plan. Section
3.9 of the Disclosure Schedule lists each material Bison Plan applicable to any
Bison Subsidiary having its jurisdiction of organization within the United
States and all foreign pension plans. A copy of each material Bison Plan (and,
if applicable, related amendments, trust agreements, current summary plan
descriptions, most recent Form 5500, most recent Internal Revenue Service
determination letter and most recent actuarial report) applicable solely to any
Bison Subsidiary having its jurisdiction of organization within the United
States has been made available to Holdings, and a copy of each material Bison
Plan from which assets will be transferred from Parent to C&A Products
pursuant to Section 5.7 will be made available to Holdings prior to Closing.</p>
<p>(b) No liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by
any Bison Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full,
and, to Parent&#39;s knowledge, no condition exists that presents a material
risk to a Bison Subsidiary of incurring any such liability, other than liability
for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (which premiums have
been paid when due).</p>
<p>(c) Each Bison Plan (other than a Foreign Plan) has been operated and
administered in accordance with its terms and with the requirements (including
funding requirements) of applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code, except
where any failure to be so operated and administered would not, individually or
in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. All
material contributions required to be made under the terms of any Bison Plan
(other than a Foreign Plan) as of the Closing Date have been made or will be
timely made on or prior to the Closing Date. With respect to any Bison Plan
subject to Section&#160;412 of the Code or Section&#160;302 of ERISA,
there has been no application for or waiver of the minimum funding standards
imposed by Section&#160;412 of the Code, and no such plan has incurred an
&quot;accumulated funding deficiency&quot; within the meaning of
Section&#160;412(a) of the Code as of the end of the most recently completed
plan year.</p>
<p>(d) Each Bison Plan intended to be &quot;qualified&quot; within the meaning
of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service stating that it is so qualified, and no event has
occurred since the date of such determination that would adversely affect such
determination or result in the imposition of any material liability, penalty or
tax under ERISA or the Code.</p>
<p>(e) The consummation of the Transactions will not (i) entitle any employee of
any Bison Subsidiary to severance pay payable by a Bison Subsidiary, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of compensation
or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material
obligation pursuant to, any of the Bison Plans, (iii) result in any material
Default under, any of the Bison Plans or (iv) result in or satisfy a condition
to the payment of compensation that would, in combination with any other
payment, result in an &quot;excess parachute payment&quot; with respect to any
Employee within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code.</p>
<p>(f) With respect to any Bison Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, there is not
any amount of &quot;unfunded benefit liabilities&quot; (as defined in Section
4001(a)(18) of ERISA) under such plan, and the Parent is not aware of any facts
or circumstances that would materially change the funded status of any such
plan.</p>
<p>(g) No Bison Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has liability (including any
contingent liability under Section 4204 of ERISA) with respect to any
multiemployer plan, within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA.</p>
<p>(h) There are (i) to Parent&#39;s knowledge, no investigations pending by
any governmental entity (including the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation)
involving Bison Plans, and (ii) no pending or, to Parent&#39;s knowledge,
threatened claims (other than routine claims for benefits), suits or proceedings
against any Bison Plans, or against any fiduciary of any Bison Plan which would,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect.</p>
<p>(i) None of the Bison Subsidiaries or any employee of the foregoing, nor any
trustee or administrator with respect to the Bison Plans, has engaged in a
&quot;prohibited transaction&quot; (as such term is defined in Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) that could result in a tax or penalty under
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA which would, individually or
in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.</p>
<p>(j) Since January 1, 2000, the Bison Subsidiaries, and any ERISA Affiliates
which maintain a &quot;group health plan&quot; within the meaning of Section
5000(b)(1) of the Code have complied in all material respects with the
&quot;COBRA&quot; notice and continuation requirements.</p>
<p>(k) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Bison Plan subject to ERISA that
is an employee pension benefit plan and is not qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code is exempt from Part 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA as an unfunded plan
that is maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation
for a select group of management or highly compensated employees, pursuant to
Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.</p>
<p>(l) Each Foreign Plan has been operated and administered in accordance with
its terms and with the requirements of applicable Law, except where any failure
to be so operated and administered would not, individually or in the aggregate,
be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. All material
contributions required to be made under the terms of any Foreign Plan as of the
Closing Date have been made or will be timely made on or prior to the Closing
Date, and no Bison Subsidiary has incurred any unpaid obligation in connection
with the termination or withdrawal from any Foreign Plan. With respect to any
unfunded retirement plan which is a Foreign Plan for which GAAP or applicable
Law requires that reserves be recorded on a statement of financial position,
reserves have been recorded on the December 30, 2000 Statement of Net Assets to
be Sold in a manner which is consistent with GAAP and applicable Law. With
respect to funded retirement plans which are Foreign Plans, the plans have been
funded in accordance with applicable Law. Copies of the most recent actuarial
valuation reports or FAS 87 reports for Foreign Plans, to the extent that they
exist, have been made available to Holdings. There are no actions, suits or
claims (other than routine claims for benefits) pending or threatened with
respect to any Foreign Plan that would, individually, or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes hereof,
the term &quot;Foreign Plan&quot; shall mean any Bison Plan maintained or
contributed to primarily for the benefit of any employee or former employee of a
Bison Subsidiary employed outside the United States.</p>
<p>(m) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Section 3.4 and
this Section 3.9 set forth the sole representations and warranties in Article
III of this Agreement with respect to the compliance by Parent and any Bison
Subsidiary with ERISA, sections of the Code and any other Law applicable to the
operation or administration of any Bison Plan.</p>

<p>Holdings and C&A Products jointly and severally represent and warrant to
Parent, subject to the exceptions set forth in the Holdings Disclosure Schedule
(which exceptions shall specifically identify a Section to which such exception
relates, it being understood and agreed that each such exception shall be deemed
to be disclosed both under such Section and any other Section to which such

Organization, Qualification, Power and Authority</u>.</a></p>
<p>(a) Holdings is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Holdings is qualified and in
good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the properties
owned, leased or operated, or the business conducted, by it requires such
qualification, except where any failure to be so qualified or be in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to
have a Holdings Material Adverse Effect. Holdings has all requisite corporate
power and corporate authority and all necessary Permits to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where any failure to have such power and authority or Permits
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a
Holdings Material Adverse Effect. Holdings has or will have made available to
Parent prior to the Closing complete and correct copies of its certificate of
incorporation and by&#45;laws as in effect as of the date hereof.</p>
<p>(b) C&A Products is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. C&A Products is
qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction
where the properties owned, leased or operated, or the business conducted, by it
requires such qualification, except where any failure to be so qualified or be
in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
likely to have a Holdings Material Adverse Effect. C&A Products has all
requisite corporate power and corporate authority and all necessary Permits to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now

<p>(c) Holdings has the requisite corporate power and corporate authority to
execute and deliver the Transaction Agreements (to the extent it is party
thereto) and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. Such
Transaction Agreements and the consummation by Holdings of the transactions
contemplated thereby have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of
Directors of Holdings, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Holdings are necessary to authorize such Transaction Agreements or to consummate
the transactions contemplated thereby, except for such proceedings relating to
approval of the definitive Financing Agreements, which such proceedings will be
completed prior to Closing. On the Closing Date, Holdings and the Subsidiaries
of Holdings will have the requisite corporate power and corporate authority to
execute and deliver the Italian JV Documents and the Leasing Documents (to the
extent each is a party thereto.) This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Holdings and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the
valid and binding agreement of Parent, constitutes the valid and binding
agreement of Holdings, enforceable against Holdings in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by (a) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting creditors&#39;
rights generally and (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). When executed
and delivered to Parent at the Closing, the Transaction Agreements (other than
this Agreement), the Italian JV Document and the Leasing Document will be duly

extent each is a party thereto) and, assuming such agreements constitute the

<p>(d) C&A Products and its Subsidiaries have the requisite corporate power
and corporate authority to execute and deliver the Transaction Agreements (to
the extent each is a party thereto) and to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby. Such Transaction Agreements and the consummation by
C&A Products and said Subsidiaries of the transactions contemplated thereby
have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of C&A
Products, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of C&A Products and
said Subsidiaries are necessary to authorize such Transaction Agreements or to

relating to approval of the definitive Financing Agreements, which such
proceedings will be completed prior to Closing. On the Closing Date, C&A
Products and the Subsidiaries of C & A Products will have the requisite
corporate powers and corporate authority to execute and deliver the Italian JV
Documents, the guarantee required by Exhibit 12 and the Leasing Documents (to
the extent each is a party thereto). This Agreement has been duly and validly

arrange for C&A Products to assume the obligations of Parent under the
Guarantees as soon as possible after the Closing Date. If the obligations under

(including the Bison Subsidiaries), and to cause Parent and the
Non&#45;Bison Subsidiaries to be released from any further obligations
thereunder, on or before the Closing Date. In the event that Parent or a
Non&#45;Bison Subsidiary is required to guarantee, or otherwise remain
liable for, the performance by C&A Products or any of its Subsidiaries

necessary or appropriate actions and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary or appropriate to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction Agreements, including the
execution of any additional documents or instruments of any kind (not containing
additional representations and warranties) which may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to carry out any of the provisions hereof. Parent, Holdings and
C&A Products shall cause the License Agreements attached hereto as Exhibits
3A, 3B and 3C, the Assignment and Assumption Agreement attached hereto as
Exhibit 2 and the Registration Rights Agreements attached hereto as Exhibits 5
and 6 to be executed on or prior to Closing.</p>
<p>(b) Holdings and C&A Products shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain financing in an amount at least equal to the Required Amount,
including by executing definitive agreements for the financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letters on or prior to the Closing Date. Holdings and C&A
Products shall not engage in any transaction outside of the ordinary course of
business that is reasonably likely to jeopardize obtaining funding in an amount
at least equal to the Required Amount. The definitive agreements for such
financing (along with any other document pursuant to which Holdings, C&A
Products or any of their Subsidiaries intend to obtain financing of all or a
portion of the Required Amount) are referred to herein collectively as the
&quot;Financing Agreements.&quot;</p>
<p>(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that at
any time it may be reasonably likely that funds will not be made available under
the Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements so as to enable Holdings and
C&A Products to proceed with the Transactions in a timely manner, Holdings
and C&A Products shall (i) immediately notify Parent, (ii) use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative funding in an amount at
least equal to the amount committed pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters on
terms and conditions comparable to those provided in the applicable Financing
Agreements or on terms that are not materially more onerous in the aggregate to
Holdings and C&A Products than those in the applicable Debt Commitment
Letter and on other reasonable and customary terms and (iii) shall continue to
use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate the Transactions; <u>provided</u>
that the foregoing shall not require that Holdings or C&A Products secure
equity financing in excess of the amounts contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter. Holdings and C&A Products shall promptly notify Parent of all
communications between Holdings and C&A Products and the parties to the
Commitment Letters which are reasonably likely to (A) affect Parent&#39;s
rights or obligations thereunder or hereunder, (B) impact the terms of the
Preferred Stock or (C) delay the Closing. Holdings and C&A Products shall
promptly deliver a copy of any such communication to Parent.</p>
<p>(d) Beginning as soon as practical after the date of this Agreement, Parent
and C&A Products will work together in good faith to identify and resolve
issues relating to the transition from Parent ownership and operation of the
Business to C&A Products ownership and operation of the Business.</p>

shall continue to employ all of the Employees who are actively employed by a
Bison Subsidiary on the Closing Date (each such employee being hereafter
referred to as a &quot;Transferred Employee&quot;), it being agreed that persons
who are on lay&#45;off or leave and who have a right to return to work at a
Bison Subsidiary or who are on short&#45;term (not more than six months)
medical disability (including pregnancy leave) who do not thereafter become
eligible for long&#45;term medical disability, or other authorized leave
(such as military, family or other leaves where return to work is subject to
statutory requirements) are to be considered Employees who are actively employed
but that persons on long&#45;term medical disability or whose
short&#45;term medical disability thereafter becomes a long&#45;term
medical disability and persons whose employment has terminated or will terminate
prior to the Closing Date without any right to return to work are not to be
considered Employees who are actively employed; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
that the provisions of this Section 5.7(a) shall not be construed to limit the

reason. For the purposes of this Agreement the terms &quot;layoff&quot;,
&quot;right to return to work&quot;, &quot;short&#45;term disability&quot;,

    one year after the Closing Date (or such longer period as may be required by
    applicable Law) substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided
    by Bison Subsidiaries to the Transferred Employees immediately prior to the

    Agreement, C&A Products shall not terminate any Stand&#45;Alone
    Pension Plan assumed pursuant to Section 5.7(c)(i) or any pension plan into
    which Parent has caused assets to be transferred pursuant to Section 5.7(c)
    for a period of at least 12 months after the Closing Date.</p>
    <p>(ii) C&A Products shall assume responsibility for providing all

    employers to the extent the Bison Subsidiaries provided past service credit)
    shall be treated as service with C&A Products; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
    that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
    recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Such service shall
    also apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of
    insurability requirements or the application of any pre&#45;existing
    condition limitations. Each such plan shall waive pre&#45;existing
    condition limitations to the same extent waived under the applicable plan of
    the Bison Subsidiary. Transferred Employees shall be given credit under the
    applicable plan of Holdings or any Affiliate thereof for amounts paid under
    a corresponding benefit plan during the same period for purposes of applying
    deductibles, co&#45;payments and out&#45;of&#45;pocket maximums

    but not less than the amount necessary to satisfy the applicable
    requirements of Section 414(1) and 401(a)(12) of the Code.</p>
    <p>(v) The assets to be transferred from Parent&#39;s Trustee to C&A
    Products&#39; Trustee shall be cash only and shall equal 110% of the
    projected benefit obligation as of the Closing Date of the Employees and
    Former Employees under Parent&#39;s Salaried Pension Benefit and
    Parent&#39;s Hourly Master Pension Benefit. The calculation of 110% of
    the projected benefit obligation will be calculated using the actual census
    information as of the Closing Date and by applying (i) a discount rate
    calculated pursuant to the methodologies utilized in Parent&#39;s
    December 31, 2000 audit disclosure prepared for purpose of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards Number 87 published by the FASB (&quot;FAS
    87&quot;) and (ii) other actuarial assumptions, methods and methodologies
    utilized in Parent&#39;s FAS 87 audit disclosure, each set forth in
    Section 5.7(c)(vii) of the Disclosure Schedule.</p>
    <p>(vi) The amount transferred pursuant to Section 5.7(c)(iv) shall be
    adjusted for investment earnings or losses of the trust in which Textron
    Master Retirement Plan assets are held for the period between the Closing
    Date and the actual date of transfer and reduced by the amount of any
    benefit payments from such plan to Employees and Former Employees during
    such period and a proportionate share of administrative expenses for such
    period if such administrative expenses are properly chargeable (and are
    actually charged) to the Parent&#39;s Salaried Pension Benefit or
    Parent&#39;s Hourly Master Pension Benefit. Parent shall estimate such
    earnings as of the actual date of transfer and then within 90 days of the
    actual date of transfer, Parent shall cause Parent&#39;s trust to remit
    to C&A Products&#39; trust or C&A Products shall cause C&A
    Products&#39; trust to remit to Parent&#39;s trust, as appropriate,
    an amount equal to the difference between the actual rate of earnings for
    such period and the estimated amount transferred as of the actual date of
    transfer (such difference to be adjusted for investment earnings at the
    State Street Bank short&#45;term rate for the period between the actual
    date of transfer and the date such difference is paid to Parent or C&A
    Products). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.7(c) to the contrary,
    following the Closing Date and until the date of the respective transfers of
    assets to trusts under C&A Products&#39; pension plans, Parent shall
    cause the trusts under the pension plans of Parent or an Affiliate covered
    by this Section 5.7(c) to continue to provide benefits to plan participants
    in accordance with the terms of the applicable pension plan to the extent
    that such benefits have accrued on or before the Closing Date. To the extent
    that benefits have accrued after the Closing Date, following the transfer of
    assets pursuant to Section 5.7(c)(iv), C&A Products shall pay such
    benefits to plan participants (retroactively, if applicable) in accordance
    with the terms of the applicable pension plan.</p>
    <p>(vii) The assets caused to be transferred pursuant to Section 5.7(c)
    shall be calculated by Parent&#39;s actuary, and shall be subject to
    review by C&A Products&#39; actuary for the purpose of confirming
    that the calculation was made in accordance with (i) the actuarial
    assumptions and methods set forth in this Section 5.7(c) and in Section
    5.7(c)(vii) of the Disclosure Schedule and (ii) generally accepted actuarial
    practice. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Parent shall
    provide C&A Products with a detailed summary of the calculations
    described in this Section 5.7(c) and any back&#45;up data reasonably
    requested by C&A Products. If C&A Products or C&A
    Products&#39; actuary does not notify Parent to the contrary within 60
    days after the delivery to C&A Products of such detailed summary and
    data, the calculations of Parent&#39;s actuary pursuant to this Section
    5.7(c) shall be deemed to be final, conclusive and binding on the parties.
    If, however, C&A Products notifies Parent in writing within such period
    that it and its actuaries believe that the calculations were not prepared in
    accordance with the requirements of this Section 5.7(c) and such notice
    specifies (i) the precise items of the calculations challenged, (ii) the
    basis of the challenge and (iii) the amount of the adjustment they propose
    with respect to each such item, the parties will then attempt to resolve
    their differences with respect thereto. C&A Products shall only be
    entitled to dispute any individual item that involves a proposed adjustment
    of more than $25,000 or items collectively aggregating $100,000 or more. If
    the parties are unable to resolve their dispute within 30 days after the
    date C&A Products notifies Parent of the disputed items, the disputed
    items shall be referred to an international benefits consulting firm (the
    &quot;Actuary Firm&quot;) mutually acceptable to C&A Products and
    Parent. The Actuary Firm shall be asked to resolve such disputes and report
    to Parent and C&A Products upon such remaining disputed items within 45
    days after such referral. The decision of the Actuary Firm shall be final,
    conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. The fees and expenses of the
    Actuary Firm in conducting this assignment shall be borne equally by Parent
    and C&A Products.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>(d) <u>Defined Contribution Plan</u>. Parent will cause each Transferred
Employee participating in the Textron Savings Plan to be fully vested in his/her
benefits under the Textron Savings Plan as of the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date and following
delivery by C&A Products to Parent of a favorable Internal Revenue Service
determination letter regarding a defined contribution plan of C&A Products
(the &quot;C&A Products&#39; Savings Plan&quot;) or an opinion,
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, of C&A Products&#39; counsel to the
effect that the terms of the C&A Products&#39; Savings Plan and its
related trust qualify, as to form, under section 401(a) and Section 501(a) of
the Code, Parent shall cause the trustee of the Textron Savings Plan to transfer
all of the assets and liabilities thereof attributable to Transferred Employees
to the C&A Products&#39; Savings Plan. The assets to be transferred
shall be cash, promissory notes for loans made to Transferred Employees under
the terms of the Textron Savings Plan and Parent common stock held in the
accounts of the Transferred Employees. The C&A Products&#39; Savings
Plan shall continue to provide Parent common stock as an investment alternative
for Transferred Employees for at least three years after the Closing Date. Such
Parent common stock investment alternative shall only be available to
Transferred Employees who have Parent common stock transferred from their
account in the Textron Savings Plan to their account in the C&A
Products&#39; Savings Plan and only to the extent of the Parent common stock
so transferred. No new contributions or intraplan transfers will be allowed into
the Parent common stock investment alternative, and amounts transferred out of
the Parent common stock investment alternative may not be transferred to such
investment alternative.</p>
<p>(e) <u>Collective Bargaining Agreements</u>. Effective as of the Closing
Date, C&A Products or a Subsidiary of C&A Products shall assume the
collective bargaining agreements listed in Section 5.7(e) of the Disclosure
Schedule. C&A Products acknowledges that at Closing, C&A Products or
such Subsidiary of C&A Products will become a successor employer under such
collective bargaining agreements and agree to assume all obligations of any
Bison Subsidiary under such agreements.</p>
<p>(f) <u>Severance and Other Liability</u>.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 5.7(f), C&A
    Products or a Subsidiary of C&A Products shall assume, discharge, pay
    and be solely liable for and shall indemnify and hold Parent harmless from
    and against all Losses relating to any Claim or liability arising out of the
    employment of the Employees and Former Employees which is payable after the
    Closing, including Claims or liability under any Bison Plan; <u>provided</u>,
    <u>however</u>, that C&A Products and its Subsidiaries shall not be
    liable for any Claim arising from an event occurring prior to Closing to the
    extent that it is covered by insurance carried by Parent or a Subsidiary of
    Parent.</p>
    <p>(ii) Parent shall retain any and all liability for Losses relating to
    severance costs incurred by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Bison
    Subsidiaries) on or prior to the Closing that relate to employees of any
    Subsidiary of Parent, whether or not any such employee is transferred to a
    Bison Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing Date, except for Losses relating
    to the termination of employees at the written request of Holdings or
    C&A Products.</p>
    <p>(iii) C&A Products shall pay 50%, and Parent shall pay the other 50%,
    of any Severance Payment payable to persons identified in Section 5.7(f)(A)
    of the Disclosure Schedule if such amount is payable as a result of such
    person&#39;s termination of his or her employment after the Closing Date
    and during the term of said agreement for &quot;good reason&quot;, as
    defined in the agreement relating to such person listed in Section 5.7(f)(A)
    of the Disclosure Schedule; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that C&A
    Products and its Subsidiaries shall not be responsible for Severance
    Payments to such persons in excess of 50% of the amount set forth for each
    such person in Section 5.7(f)(B) of the Disclosure Schedule, and any
    remaining amount shall be paid by Parent. Except as set forth in the
    preceding sentence, C&A Products shall pay 100% of any Severance Payment
    if such amount is payable as a result of a Qualifying Termination, as
    defined in the agreement relating to such person listed in Section 5.7(f)(A)
    of the Disclosure Schedule (each an &quot;Employee Agreement&quot;), which
    occurs after the Closing Date; <u>provided</u>, that Parent shall reimburse
    C&A for the cost of any such payment above the amount set forth in
    Section 5.7(f)(B) of the Disclosure Schedule. &quot;Severance Payment&quot;
    shall mean the severance benefits payable pursuant to the Employment
    Agreements.</p>
    <p>(iv) C&A Products shall pay the portion of any Retention Payment
    payable to persons identified in Sections 5.7(f)(A) of the Disclosure
    Schedule equal to a fraction (the &quot;Fraction&quot;) whose numerator is
    365 minus the number of days elapsed from and including January 1, 2001,
    through the Closing Date, and whose denominator is 365, up to a maximum
    amount for each person equal to the amount set forth in Section 5.7(f)(B) of
    the Disclosure Schedule multiplied by the Fraction. Parent shall pay the
    balance of the Retention Payments. The term &quot;Retention Payment&quot;
    shall mean the retention awards and any special operating incentive and
    divestiture incentive awards payable pursuant to the Employment Agreements.</p>
    <p>(v) Except for payments by C&A Products described in Sections
    5.7(f)(iii) and 5.7(f)(iv), C&A Products shall not be liable for any
    severance or retention payments payable under any written agreement signed
    by an Employee and existing prior to Closing, excluding agreements entered
    into in the ordinary course of business with Employees of a Bison Subsidiary
    organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States and
    excluding collective bargaining agreements (it being understood and agreed
    that company policies generally applicable to all or a class of employees
    shall not be deemed to be an agreement for the purposes of this subsection).</p>
    <p>(vi) Except as set forth in Section 5.1(h) of the Disclosure Schedule,
    neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries shall amend, or cause to be amended, any
    term or provision in any agreement listed in Section 5.7(f)(A) of the
    Disclosure Schedule without the prior written consent of Holdings.</p>
    <p>(vii) Payments which are the responsibility of Parent under Sections
    5.7(f)(ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) shall be paid to the person by C&A
    Products within five days after receipt from Parent of funds equal to the
    amount of said payments.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(g) <u>Worker&#39;s Compensation Claims</u>. C&A Products shall
assume liability for all suits, claims, proceedings and actions pending as of or
commenced after the Closing Date resulting from actual or alleged harm or injury
to Employees or Former Employees regardless of when the incident or accident
giving rise to such liability occurred or occurs. Holdings will make all
necessary arrangements to assume all worker&#39;s compensation claim files,
whether open or closed, as of the Closing Date, and will make the necessary
arrangements for assuming the continued management of such liabilities.</p>
<p>(h) <u>Foreign Plans</u>. To the extent that Employees and Former Employees
(or employees or former employees of THI or its Subsidiaries) are located in a
jurisdiction outside of the United States and are covered by defined benefit
plans or similar plans which also cover persons employed by Parent, any
Non&#45;Bison Subsidiary or their Affiliates, Holdings will cause similar
plans to be established for such persons in accordance with applicable Law,
labor agreements and customary practice, and Parent will cause assets to be
transferred to the applicable trusts of such successor plans established by
C&A Products, it being agreed that the amount of assets to be transferred to
such trusts will be the minimum amount required by applicable Law.</p>

<p>(a) <u>Tax Returns</u>. Except as provided in Section 9.13,</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) Parent shall file or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns that
    are required to be filed by or with respect to each of the Bison
    Subsidiaries (other than Permali do Brasil Industria e Comercio Ltda.
    (&quot;Permali&quot;), Rosario Project S.A. (&quot;Rosario&quot;), Plascar,
    and TATB, collectively, the &quot;Brazilian Entities&quot;) for taxable
    years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and Parent shall
    remit (or cause to be remitted) any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
    Returns.</p>
    <p>(ii) Parent shall file or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns that
    are required to be filed by or with respect to each of the Brazilian
    Entities that are due on or before the Closing Date, and Parent shall remit
    (or cause to be remitted) any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.</p>
    <p>(iii) Holdings shall file or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns
    that are required to be filed by or with respect to each of the Brazilian
    Entities that are due after the Closing Date with respect to taxable years
    or periods ending on or before the Closing Date or Straddle Periods, and
    Holdings shall remit (or cause to be remitted) any Taxes due in respect of
    such Tax Returns.</p>
    <p>(iv) Holdings shall file or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns
    that are required to be filed by or with respect to each of the Bison
    Subsidiaries (other than the Brazilian Entities and THI and its
    Subsidiaries) for taxable years or periods ending after the Closing Date,
    and Holdings shall remit (or cause to be remitted) any Taxes due in respect
    of such Tax Returns.</p>
    <p>(v) Any Tax Return required to be filed by Holdings relating to any
    Straddle Period shall be submitted (with copies of any relevant schedules,
    work papers and other documentation then available) to Parent for
    Parent&#39;s approval not less than 45 days prior to the due date
    (including extensions) for the filing of such Tax Return, which approval
    shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Parent shall
    have the option of providing to Holdings, at any time at least 30 days prior
    to the due date, written instructions as to how Parent wants any, or all, of
    the items for which it may be liable reflected on such Tax Return. Holdings
    shall, in preparing such return, cause the items for which Parent is liable
    hereunder to be reflected in accordance with Parent&#39;s instructions
    (unless, in the opinion of nationally recognized tax advisor to Holdings,
    complying with Parent&#39;s instructions would likely subject Holdings
    to any criminal penalty or to one or more civil penalties under Sections
    6662 through 6664 of the Code or similar provisions of applicable state,
    local or foreign laws) and, in the absence of having received such
    instructions, in accordance with past practice, if any, to the extent
    permissible under applicable Law.</p>
    <p>(vi) Upon the written request of Holdings setting forth in detail the
    computation of the amount owed, Parent shall pay to Holdings, no later than

    schedules and work papers required by Parent to enable Parent to prepare and
    file all Tax Returns required to be prepared and filed by it pursuant to
    Section 5.8(a)(i). Holdings shall prepare such package in good faith in a
    manner substantially consistent with Parent&#39;s past practice.</p>
    <p>(viii) Parent may amend any Tax Return filed or required to be filed by
    or with respect to each of the Bison Subsidiaries (other than the Brazilian
    Entities) for any taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing
    Date; <u>provided</u>, that no such amendment shall be permitted if it would
    result in any Tax Detriment to any Bison Subsidiary after the Closing.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(b) <u>Computation of Tax Liabilities</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) To the extent permitted or required by law or administrative
    practice, (A)&#160;the taxable year of each Bison Subsidiary which
    includes the Closing Date shall be treated as closing on (and including) the
    Closing Date and, notwithstanding the foregoing, (B)&#160;all
    transactions not in the ordinary course of business occurring after the
    Closing Date shall be reported on Holdings&#39; consolidated United
    States federal income Tax Return to the extent permitted by Treasury
    Regulation Section 1.1502&#45;76(b)(1)(ii)(B) and shall be similarly
    reported on other Tax Returns of Holdings or its Affiliates to the extent
    permitted by applicable Law. For purposes of Sections 5.8, where it is
    necessary to apportion between Parent and Holdings the Tax liability of an
    entity for a Straddle Period (which is not treated under the immediately
    preceding sentence as closing on the Closing Date), such liability shall be
    apportioned between the period deemed to end at the close of the Closing
    Date, and the period deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following
    the Closing Date on the basis of an interim closing of the books, except
    that Taxes (such as real property Taxes) imposed on a periodic basis shall
    be allocated on a daily basis.</p>
    <p>(ii) In determining Parent&#39;s liability for Taxes pursuant to this
    Agreement, Parent shall be credited with the amount of estimated Taxes paid
    by or on behalf of any of the Bison Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. To
    the extent that Parent&#39;s liability for Taxes for a taxable year or
    period is less than the amount of estimated income Taxes previously paid by
    or on behalf of any of the Bison Subsidiaries (other than THI and its
    Subsidiaries) with respect to all or a portion of such taxable year or
    period, Holdings shall pay Parent the difference within two days of filing
    the Tax Return relating to such income Taxes.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(c) <u>Refunds</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) Any Tax refund (including any interest in respect thereof) received
    by Holdings, C&A Products or any of the Bison Subsidiaries (other than
    the Brazilian Entities and THI and its Subsidiaries), and any amounts
    credited against Tax to which Holdings, C&A Products or any of the Bison
    Subsidiaries (other than the Brazilian Entities and THI and its
    Subsidiaries) becomes entitled (including by way of any amended Tax Returns
    or any carryback filing), that relate to any taxable period, or portion
    thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the account of
    Parent, and Holdings shall pay over to Parent any such refund or the amount
    of any such credit within 15 days after receipt of such credit or
    entitlement thereto.</p>
    <p>(ii) Any Tax refund (including any interest in respect thereof) received
    by Permali or Rosario, and any amounts credited against Tax to which Permali
    or Rosario becomes entitled (including by way of any amended Tax Returns or
    any carryback filing), that relate to any taxable period, or portion
    thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the account of
    Parent, and Holdings shall pay over to Parent any such refund or the amount
    of any such credit within 15 days after receipt of such credit or
    entitlement thereto.</p>
    <p>(iii) The percentage (the &quot;Ownership Percentage&quot;), equal to the
    lesser of (A) 56.6% or (B) the percentage of issued and outstanding stock of
    Plascar held by Permali, of any Tax refund (including any interest in
    respect thereof) received by Plascar or TATB or any amounts credited against
    Tax to which Plascar or TATB becomes entitled (including by way of any
    amended Tax Returns or any carryback filing), that relate to any taxable
    period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date shall be
    for the account of Parent, and Holdings shall pay over to Parent the
    Ownership Percentage of any such refund or credit within 15 days after
    receipt of such credit or entitlement thereto.</p>
    <p>(iv) Holdings shall pay Parent interest at the rate prescribed under
    Section 6621(a)(1) of the Code, compounded daily, on any amount not paid
    when due under this Section 5.8(c). For purposes of this Section 5.8(c),
    where it is necessary to apportion a refund or credit between Holdings and
    Parent for a Straddle Period, such refund or credit shall be apportioned
    between the period deemed to end at the close of the Closing Date and the
    period deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following the Closing
    Date on the basis of an interim closing of the books of each of the Bison
    Subsidiaries (other than THI and its Subsidiaries), except that refunds or
    credits of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (e.g., real property Taxes)
    shall be allocated on a daily basis.</p>
    <p>(v) Holdings shall cooperate, and cause C&A Products and each of the
    Bison Subsidiaries (other than THI and its Subsidiaries) to cooperate, in
    obtaining, at Parent&#39;s expense, any Tax refund (other than a refund
    based on a carryback from a taxable year or period beginning after the
    Closing Date) that Parent reasonably believes is available based on
    substantial authority, including through filing appropriate forms with the
    applicable Tax Authority; <u>provided</u>, that if the refund would result
    in any Tax Detriment to any Bison Subsidiary after the Closing, Parent shall
    reimburse Holdings the amount of such Tax Detriment.</p>

<p>(d) <u>Certain Post&#45;Closing Settlement Payments</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) If the examination of any federal, state, local or other Tax Return
    of Parent for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date shall
    result (by settlement or otherwise) in any adjustment which permits
    Holdings, C&A Products or any of the Bison Subsidiaries (other than THI
    and its Subsidiaries) to increase deductions, losses or tax credits or
    decrease the income, gains or recapture of tax credits which would otherwise
    (but for such adjustments) have been reported or taken into account
    (including by way of any increase in basis) by Holdings, C&A Products or
    any of the Bison Subsidiaries (other than THI and its Subsidiaries) for one
    or more periods ending within ten years after the Closing Date, Parent shall
    notify Holdings and provide it with adequate information so that Holdings
    can reflect on its, C&A Products&#39; or the applicable Bison
    Subsidiary&#39;s Tax Returns such increases in deductions, losses or tax
    credits or decreases in income, gains or recapture of tax credits. Holdings
    shall pay to Parent, within 30 days of the realization of any resulting Tax
    Benefits, the amount of any resulting Tax Benefits.</p>
    <p>(ii) If the examination of any federal, state, local or other Tax Return
    of Holdings, C&A Products or any of the Bison Subsidiaries for any
    taxable period ending after the Closing Date shall result (by settlement or
    otherwise) in any adjustment which permits Parent to increase deductions,
    losses or tax credits or decrease the income, gains or recapture of tax
    credits which would otherwise (but for such adjustments) have been reported
    or taken into account (including by way of any increase in basis) by Parent
    for one or more periods ending on or before the Closing Date, Holdings shall
    notify Parent and provide it with adequate information so that Parent can
    reflect on its Tax Returns such increases in deductions, losses or tax
    credits or decreases in income, gains or recapture of tax credits. Parent
    shall pay to Holdings, within 30 days of the receipt of such information,
    the amount of any resulting Tax Benefits.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>(e) <u>Post&#45;Closing Actions which Affect Parent&#39;s Liability
for Taxes</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) Holdings shall not take, or cause or permit C&A Products or any

    their Affiliates) to take, any action, with respect to the taxable year or
    period of Holdings, C&A Products, such Bison Subsidiary, or Affiliate,

    Parent to indemnify Holdings for Taxes pursuant to this Agreement)
    including, for example, any action which would be reasonably likely to,

information to the other party regarding any of the Bison Subsidiaries or the
Business in connection with (i) the other party preparing any Tax Returns which
such other party is responsible for preparing and filing, and (ii) the other
party preparing for any audits of, or disputes with any Tax Authority regarding,
any Tax Returns of any of the Bison Subsidiaries. In connection therewith,
Holdings, C&A Products and Parent shall not dispose of any Tax work papers,
books or records relating to any of the Bison Subsidiaries during the
six&#45;year period following the Closing Date, and thereafter shall give
the other parties reasonable written notice before disposing of such items.</p>
<p>(g) <u>Section 338(g) Elections</u>. Holdings shall ensure that C&A
Products does not make any election under Section 338(g) of the Code (or any
analogous provision of state, local, or foreign law) with respect to the
purchase of the stock of any foreign Bison Subsidiary without the prior written
consent of Parent, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of
Parent. If Parent does so consent, Holdings and C&A Products shall jointly
and severally be liable for, and shall pay, any Tax attributable to, or
resulting from, the making of such election and will indemnify Parent from and
against any Tax liability or other adverse consequences attributable to, or
resulting directly or indirectly from, the making of such election. Any
indemnification obligation of Holdings and C&A Products pursuant to this
Section 5.8(g) shall be increased by the relevant After Tax Amount. For purposes
of this Agreement, &quot;After Tax Amount&quot; means any additional amount
necessary to reflect the tax consequences of the receipt or accrual of such
reimbursement payment (including the payment of an additional amount or amounts
hereunder) determined by using the actual marginal federal, state, foreign or
local rates for the relevant taxable period.</p>
<p>(h) <u>Stock Options</u>. Holdings and its Affiliates (including C&A
Products and the Bison Subsidiaries (other than THI and its Subsidiaries)) shall
not claim any Tax deduction arising by reason of any exercise of an employee
stock option to acquire Parent stock held by employees of any Bison Subsidiary.
If, however, all or any part of a Tax deduction claimed by Parent with respect
to the exercise of an option to acquire Parent stock held by employees of any
Bison Subsidiary is disallowed to Parent, then, to the extent permitted by law,
Holdings, C&A Products or a Bison Subsidiary (or their appropriate
Affiliate) shall claim such Tax deduction. If Holdings, C&A Products or a
Bison Subsidiary (or any of their Affiliates) receives any Tax Benefit in any
taxable period as a result of any Tax deduction claimed by Holdings, C&A
Products or a Bison Subsidiary (other than THI and its Subsidiaries) (or any of
their Affiliates) pursuant to this Section 5.8(h), Holdings shall promptly pay
to Parent the amount of such Tax Benefit.</p>
<p>(i) <u>Indemnification by Parent</u>. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, Parent shall indemnify Holdings from and against and in respect
of any and all Losses incurred by Holdings (or with respect to subsection (ii)
below, by Holdings or THI and its Subsidiaries, without duplication), which may
be imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by or assessed against Holdings
(or with respect to subsection (ii) below, by Holdings or THI and its
Subsidiaries, without duplication), directly or indirectly, to the extent

    reasonably expected to result in a material increase in Tax liability of any
    Bison Subsidiaries for which Holdings would be liable under this Section

shall not engage in the business of (i) manufacturing or selling overhead
systems, headliners, interior instrument panels, interior quarter panel/sidewall
trim, interior trim consoles, lift&#45;gate trim panels, painted or
unpainted fascia and bumpers, claddings/exterior trim moldings, exterior

or (ii) assembling or selling cockpit systems or front&#45;end modules, in
each case as currently manufactured, assembled or sold by the Bison Subsidiaries
and in each case for use in automotive passenger cars and light and heavy trucks
(the &quot;Restricted Field&quot;). For the avoidance of doubt, the continued
operation of the existing businesses of Parent and the Non&#45;Bison
Subsidiaries and the continued ownership by Parent or one or more of its
Affiliates of a direct or indirect equity interest in THI and its Subsidiaries
shall not be a violation of this Section 5.11(a). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, if C&A Products or any of its Subsidiaries
default under any of the Leasing Documents and Parent or any of its Affiliates
continue to own any interest in the Equipment (as defined in the Equipment Lease
Term Sheet attached hereto as Exhibit 12) subject thereto, then the Parent
Entities (and all Affiliates of Parent) shall be permitted to use such Equipment
(whether or not in the Restricted Field) and lease, license, sell or otherwise
transfer (whether or not for use in the Restricted Field) all or any part of
their respective right, title and interest in and to such Equipment to any third
party.</p>
<p>(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Entities may acquire, directly
or indirectly, all or substantially all of the capital stock or assets of any
Person (an &quot;After&#45;Acquired Business&quot;) which derives 33% or
less of its gross sales revenues from the Restricted Field, if Parent or such
Parent Entity promptly grants to Holdings an option to acquire the portion of
the After&#45;Acquired Business which engages in the Restricted Field (the
&quot;Restricted Portion&quot;) upon the terms and conditions set forth in this
Section 5.11(b) and promptly gives notice to Holdings of such option (but in no
event later than the date the After&#45;Acquired Business was acquired). The
purchase price for the Restricted Portion shall be an amount equal to the
aggregate purchase price, including any liabilities assumed by a Parent Entity,
paid by a Parent Entity for the After&#45;Acquired Business, multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the net operating profit or other
mutually acceptable measure of value of the Restricted Portion during the most
recently completed fiscal year prior to the date such Parent Entity acquired the
After&#45;Acquired Business and the denominator of which shall be the net
operating profit or other mutually acceptable measure of value of the
After&#45;Acquired Business during the same period.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) The purchase of the Restricted Portion by Holdings will be subject to
    the execution by the Parent Entity and Holdings of a mutually satisfactory
    definitive agreement for such purchase and the obtaining of all necessary
    regulatory approvals from any Governmental Authority and material third
    party Consents (in each case at no out&#45;of&#45;pocket cost or
    expense to the Parent Entity) and the expiration or termination of any
    applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and any applicable Foreign
    Competition Laws. The Parent Entity&#39;s representations and warranties
    in the definitive purchase agreement for the Restricted Portion shall be
    limited to reasonable assurances that the applicable Parent Entity had
    caused the Restricted Portion to be operated in the ordinary course of
    business during the period of such Parent Entity&#39;s ownership, and
    the Parent Entity shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
    rights under the purchase agreement by which it acquired the
    After&#45;Acquired Business to the extent relating to the Restricted
    Portion to be assigned or otherwise made available to Holdings. The
    definitive purchase agreement shall provide that such agreement may be
    terminated at the option of either a Parent Entity (or the applicable
    Non&#45;Bison Subsidiary) or Holdings if such transaction is not
    consummated by the six month anniversary of the date the
    After&#45;Acquired Business was acquired by a Parent Entity.</p>
    <p>(ii) If Holdings fails to give Parent notice of its intent to exercise
    this option on or before the one month anniversary of the date the
    After&#45;Acquired Business was acquired or the sale of the Restricted
    Portion to Holdings is not consummated, other than because of a default by a

Textron Automotive Company Italia S.r.l. (the &quot;Italian Opco&quot;) will be
a wholly owned subsidiary of THI and that THI will be operated as a joint
venture between one or more Subsidiaries of Parent and a Subsidiary of Holdings.
Prior to the Closing, Parent will use commercially reasonable best efforts to
cause THI to purchase all of the shares of capital stock of the Italian Opco
owned by Magneti Marelli Holding S.p.A.</p>
<p>(b) Subject to Section 2.6(b), on the Closing Date, with effect from and

(collectively, the &quot;Italian JV Documents&quot;).</p>
<p>(c) Thirty days after delivery of a written request by Parent that Holdings
purchase the THI Shares owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries that represent 50%
of the total number of THI Shares outstanding as of the Closing Date (the
&quot;Put Notice&quot;), which request may be delivered any time after the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, C&A Products shall purchase said THI Shares
for a purchase price of twenty&#45;three million one hundred forty thousand
dollars ($23,140,000), less any amount received in respect of such THI Shares
after the Closing Date from any liquidation or other distribution, dividend or
payment to Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (other than distributions,
dividends or payments made for the purpose of payment of Taxes); <u>provided</u>,
that if Fiat Auto S.p.A. has not implemented a slow&#45;pay payables policy

facilitate the implementation of a slow&#45;pay payables policy by Fiat Auto
S.p.A., and shall promptly notify Parent in the event any such policy is
implemented. The rights of Parent under this Section 5.20(c) shall not be
assignable to any other Person, except an Affiliate of Parent.</p>
<p>(d) If Parent does not deliver a Put Notice pursuant to Section 5.20(c)
within ninety days after the third anniversary of the Closing Date, all excess
cash not required for the normal operations and debt service of THI and its
Subsidiaries shall be swept out of THI and its Subsidiaries from time to time
and paid over to C&A Products in exchange for a promise to repay as
described in the Joint Venture and Shareholders Agreement attached hereto as
Exhibit 8. Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, from time to time
take any and all action, including to cause its or their THI director designees
to take any and all action, necessary to permit such payment to C&A Products
consistent with Italian law.</p>
<p>(e) At any time after the third anniversary of the Closing Date, Holdings, by
written notice delivered to Parent (the &quot;Call Notice&quot;), may require
that Parent and its Subsidiaries sell all (but not less than all) of the THI
Shares owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries to Holdings, or a Subsidiary of
Holdings, for a total price equal to the fair market value of 100% of the total
THI Shares outstanding (the &quot;Fair Market Value&quot;) multiplied by a
fraction whose numerator is the number of THI Shares owned by Parent and its
Subsidiaries and whose denominator is the total number of THI Shares
outstanding; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that neither Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall be obligated to sell its THI Shares pursuant to the Call
Notice if it delivers a Put Notice to Holdings pursuant to Section 5.20(c)
within twenty days after receiving a Call Notice; <u>provided</u> <u>further</u>,
<u>however</u>, that the rights of Holdings under this Section 5.20(e) shall not
be assignable to any other Person by Holdings other than as collateral security
for the borrowings described in the Debt Commitment Letter and except to an
Affiliate of Holdings. Fair Market Value shall be that which a willing buyer and
a willing seller, under no economic compulsion to buy or sell and without regard
to any existing position in THI, would be willing to pay in cash to acquire the
subject THI Shares and shall be determined in good faith by Holdings and
specified in the Call Notice delivered to Parent.</p>
<p>(f) The shareholders in THI will cooperate to ensure that all information
regarding THI necessary to enable THI and its Subsidiaries to timely prepare
their Tax Returns is available, if within their respective abilities to do so.</p>
<p>(g) The shareholders in THI will cooperate to ensure that THI provides its
shareholders all information regarding THI necessary to enable its shareholders
to timely prepare and file any Tax Returns.</p>
<p>(h) Any of the rights to purchase THI Shares, whether upon exercise of the

without relieving C&A Products of its obligations under these provisions.</p>

<p>(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent agrees to cause the sale of
equipment to Textron Financial Corporation or one of its Affiliates for the
purposes of the transactions described in the terms sheets attached hereto as
Exhibit 12, and immediately thereafter cause the Subsidiary which sold the
assets to enter into a lease with Textron Financial Corporation or one of its
Affiliates on terms consistent with Exhibit&#160;12. To the extent that the
leverage ratio (as determined under the definitive financing documentation for
the debt financing of the Transactions, assuming EBITDA of $377.1 million)
exceeds 3.82:1.00 on or shortly prior to the Closing Date, the parties will use
their commercially reasonable best efforts to cause additional property and/or
equipment of Parent or its Subsidiaries to be made subject to the described
leasing transactions for the purpose of reducing the requisite debt financing so
as to comply with such ratio as a condition precedent set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters. It is agreed that in no event shall the fair market value of
the property or the equipment subject to the leasing transactions be less than
eighty six million nine hundred thousand dollars ($86,900,000). The documents
required to be executed to consummate the transactions referred to in the
attached term sheets on the terms described therein are referred to as the

<p>(b) C&A Products will use commercially reasonable efforts to locate a
third party to purchase the property subject to the Leasing Documents from
Textron Financial Corporation, or, if unsuccessful, obtain funding to enable
C&A Products to purchase said property on or prior to the second anniversary
of the Closing Date. Such sale may (but need not be) effected subject to the
Leasing Documents or new leasing documentation may be entered into by C&A
Products and its Subsidiaries with the new owner. Nothing herein shall be
construed as requiring that C&A Products is obligated to purchase any such
property.</p>

the individuals listed in Schedule H hereto solely as a result of actions taken
by Parent in the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2001 in connection with a

representation and warranty shall survive until the third anniversary of the
Closing Date and shall not be subject to the limitations of liability set forth
in Article VIII. Neither C&A Products nor its Subsidiaries shall claim any
Tax deduction with respect to any payments made pursuant to this Section 5.22(a)
unless it is required by the relevant Tax Authority to treat the reimbursement
as income.</p>
<p>(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent will terminate the employment of
approximately 225 employees of the Business with the goal of achieving savings
of approximately $18.8 million during the period January 1, 2002 through

Products, or its applicable Subsidiaries, make payments on behalf of Parent for
cash severance and termination payments, in amounts established by Parent, to,
or for the benefit of, the terminated employees solely as a result of
Parent&#39;s actions prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall reimburse
C&A Products, or its applicable Subsidiaries, for the cost of such payments.
Neither C&A Products nor its applicable Subsidiaries shall claim any Tax
deduction with respect to any payments made pursuant to this Section 5.22(b)

promptly provide Parent all information necessary for Parent to satisfy any
applicable information reporting obligations with respect to such payments.
Except for the cash severance and termination payments referred to in this
Section 5.22(b). C&A Products shall be solely liable for all Losses relating

    of the breach of any representation or warranty in Sections 3.3(b), 3.6,
    3.7, 3.12 and 3.16, a Holdings Indemnified Party shall not make any claim
    against Parent which individually does not exceed five hundred thousand
    dollars ($500,000), and such claims not meeting this threshold shall not be
    applied in calculating the ten million dollar ($10,000,000) minimum
    specified above, (B) with respect to any Losses for which Holdings
    Indemnified Parties would be entitled pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) other
    than those referred to in Section 8.1(d)(i)(A), a Holdings Indemnified Party
    shall not make any Claim against Parent which individually does not exceed
    fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) and such Claims not meeting this threshold
    shall not be applied in calculating the ten million dollar ($10,000,000)
    minimum specified above, and (C) Parent&#39;s maximum aggregate
    indemnification liability for which Holdings Indemnified Parties would be
    entitled pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) and Section 8.2(a) (excluding

    of, (A) the Dover Municipal Landfill located in Dover, New Hampshire and (B)

    indemnification obligation for breach of any representation or warranty
    contained in Section 3.2(b) or (c) and pursuant to Sections 8.1(b)(ii) and

    Agreement, in the event that a Holdings Indemnified Party is entitled to any
    indemnification amounts pursuant to Section 5.8 (i), Section 8.1(b)(i) or
    Section 8.2(a) in connection with Losses or Environmental Losses, as
    applicable, relating to or arising out of the business conducted by THI or
    its Subsidiaries, then, subject to the limitations set forth in Section
    8.1(d)(i) and Section 8.2(a), Parent shall pay (A) a minimum of 50% of such
    Losses or Environmental Loses, as applicable, at the time otherwise
    specified in Section 8.1 (and the remaining Losses shall not be taken into
    account for the purposes of calculating the deductibles, baskets and cap set
    forth in Section 8.1(d)(i) and Section 8.2(a)) and (B) the remaining 50% of
    such Losses or Environmental Losses, as applicable, when, and only to the
    extent that, Parent or its Subsidiaries receive cash in connection with the
    consummation of the sale of Parent&#39;s and its Subsidiaries&#39;
    THI Shares contemplated by Section 5.20; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
    that if Parent or its Subsidiaries have received solely cash in connection
    with the sale of their THI Shares pursuant to Section 5.20, than all such
    remaining Losses and Environmental Losses shall become due and payable at
    the time otherwise specified in Section 8.1.</p>
    <p>(iii) No party shall be liable for any Losses pursuant to Sections 8.1(b)
    or (c) unless the party seeking such indemnification (the &quot;Indemnified
    Party&quot;) has (x) delivered the notice of Claim in respect of such Loss
    required by Section 8.1(e) below and (y) such notice of Claim is received by
    the party from which indemnification is sought (the &quot;Indemnifying
    Party&quot;) within 30 days after the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
    except that (A) for any Losses relating to or arising out of breaches of any
    representations or warranties contained in Sections 3.2(b) and (c) and
    Section 4.4(a) and (b), such notice of Claim may be delivered at any time,
    (B) for breach of any covenant or agreement, such notice of Claim may be
    delivered at any time prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of
    limitation and (C) for Environmental Losses such notice of Claim may be
    delivered on or prior to the period specified in Section 8.2.
    Indemnification under Section 8.1(b)(i) and (ii) and Section 8.1(c)(i) and
    (ii) shall be the exclusive remedy of Holdings, C&A Products and Parent,
    as applicable, for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
    agreement (excluding breach of any covenant contained in Section 5.8 for
    which the exclusive remedy of Holdings, C&A Products and Parent, as
    applicable, shall be indemnification pursuant to Section 5.8) contained in
    this Agreement, the Transition Agreement and the Assignment and Assumption
    Agreement.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(e) <u>Notice of Claim</u>. If the Indemnified Party shall become aware of
any claim, proceeding or other matter (a &quot;Claim&quot;) which may give rise
to a Loss or Environmental Loss that will be taken into account for purposes of
calculating whether the Indemnifying Party&#39;s indemnification obligation
arises pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(c) above or Section 8.2(a) or
Section 8.3 below, the Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice thereof to
the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall specify whether the Claim arises as a
result of a Claim by a Person against the Indemnified Party (a &quot;Third Party
Claim&quot;) or whether the Claim does not so arise (a &quot;Direct
Claim&quot;), and shall also specify with reasonable particularity (to the
extent that the information is available) the factual basis for the Claim and
the amount of the Claim, if known. If the Indemnified Party does not promptly
give notice of any Claim as specified above, such failure shall not be deemed a
waiver of the Indemnified Party&#39;s right to indemnification or
application to the applicable deductible set forth in Section 8.1(d), Section
8.2(a)(iii) or Section 8.2 (a)(iv) hereunder for Losses or Environmental Losses
in connection with such Claim, but the amount of reimbursement to which the
Indemnified Party is entitled or application to the applicable deductible shall
be reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Indemnified Party&#39;s
Losses or Environmental Losses would have been reduced had such notice been
promptly delivered.</p>
<p>(f) <u>Direct Claims</u>. With respect to any Direct Claim, following receipt
of notice from the Indemnified Party of the Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
have 90 days to make such investigation of the Claim as is considered necessary
or desirable. For the purpose of such investigation, the Indemnified Party shall
make available to the Indemnifying Party the information relied upon by the
Indemnified Party to substantiate the Claim, together with all such other
information as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. If both parties
agree at or prior to the expiration of such 90&#45;day period (or any
mutually agreed upon extension thereof) to the validity and amount of such
Claim, they shall agree to apply it to the applicable deductible, or if the
applicable deductible has been satisfied, the Indemnifying Party shall
immediately pay to the Indemnified Party the full agreed upon amount of the
Claim, failing which the matter shall be referred to binding arbitration in such
manner as the parties may agree or shall be determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in the State of Delaware.</p>
<p>(g) <u>Third Party Claims</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) With respect to any Third Party Claims, the Indemnifying Party shall
    have the right, at its expense and at its election, to assume control of the
    negotiation, settlement and defense of the Claim through counsel of its
    choice reasonably acceptable to the other party; <u>provided</u>, that it
    irrevocably agrees that the Claim is covered by Section 8.1(b) or (c), as
    the case may be. In such event, the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the
    Indemnified Party for all the Indemnified Party&#39;s reasonable
    out&#45;of&#45;pocket expenses as a result of such assumption. The
    election of the Indemnifying Party to assume such control shall be made
    within the latter of 90 days of receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim
    or thirty days after the indemnification obligation arises, failing which
    the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have elected not to assume such
    control. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume such control, the
    Indemnified Party shall have the right to be informed and consulted with
    respect to the negotiation, settlement or defenses of such Third Party Claim
    and to retain counsel to act on its behalf, but the fees and disbursements
    of such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party unless the
    Indemnifying Party consents to the retention of such counsel or unless the
    named parties to any action or proceeding include both the Indemnifying
    Party and the Indemnified Party and a representation of both the
    Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would be
    inappropriate due to the actual or potential differing interests between
    them (such as the availability of different defenses). If the Indemnifying
    Party, having elected to assume such control, thereafter fails to defend the
    Third Party Claim within a reasonable period of time, the Indemnified Party
    shall be entitled to assume such control, and the Indemnifying Party shall
    be bound by the results obtained by the Indemnified Party with respect to
    the Third Party Claim. If any Third Party Claim is of a nature such that the
    Indemnified Party is required by applicable Law to make a payment to any
    Person (a &quot;Third Party&quot;) with respect to the Third Party Claim
    before the completion of settlement negotiations or related legal
    proceedings, the Indemnified Party may make such payment and the
    Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the provisions of Section 8.1, Section
    8.2 and Section 8.3, after demand by the Indemnified Party, reimburse the
    Indemnified Party for such payment. If the amount of any liability of the
    Indemnified Party under the Third Party Claim in respect of which such
    payment was made, as finally determined, is less than the amount which was
    paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified
    Party shall, promptly after receipt of the difference from the Third Party,
    pay the amount of such difference to the Indemnifying Party.</p>
    <p>(ii) If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume control of the defense of,
    or having assumed such control fails to defend, any Third Party Claim, the
    Indemnified Party shall have the exclusive right to consent, settle or pay
    the amount claimed, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be
    responsible for paying any such Claim or, if paid by the Indemnified Party,
    reimbursing the Indemnified Party. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party
    assumes control of the negotiation, settlement or defense of any Third Party
    Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Third Party Claim without
    the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
    unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless such settlement
    provides solely for monetary damages or other monetary payments.</p>
    <p>(iii) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate
    fully with each other with respect to Third Party Claims and, regardless of
    which party has control thereof as provided for herein, shall keep each
    other reasonably advised with respect thereto.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(h) Notwithstanding anything in Section 8.1, Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 to
the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any Losses or
Environmental Losses arising out of any matter to the extent that the Losses or
Environmental Losses with respect to such matter have been mitigated as a result
of having been reflected as a liability or the subject matter of a specific
result in the Closing Financial Statement.</p>

    Parties for the matters addressed in Section 8.2(a)(i)(A) through (C) shall
    be limited to those matters as to which Holdings provides Parent with
    written notice of said Claim in the manner set forth in Section 8.1(e)

    indemnify the Holdings Indemnified Parties for matters addressed in Section
    8.2(a)(i)(D) shall be limited to those matters as to which Holdings provides
    Parent with written notice of said Claim in the manner set forth in Section

    thereafter, Parent shall only be liable to the extent of such Environmental
    Losses in excess of five million dollars ($5,000,000); <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,

    of such Environmental Losses incurred by the Holdings Indemnified Parties
    for which such parties would otherwise be entitled to indemnification
    pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i)(A) through (D) exceeds twenty million dollars
    ($20,000,000) and thereafter, Parent shall be liable for fifty percent (50%)
    of such Environmental Losses in excess of twenty million dollars
    ($20,000,000).</p>
    <p>(v) Holdings and C&A Products shall jointly and severally indemnify
    and hold the Parent Indemnified Parties harmless against any Environmental
    Losses relating to the environmental matters set forth in Section 8.2(a)(i)
    of the Disclosure Schedule (other than any Environmental Losses relating to
    THI or any of its Subsidiaries incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties

    is required to account for THI and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis
    and (B) the date the Put Notice is delivered pursuant to Section 5.20(c)).
    Holdings and C&A Products shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold
    the Parent Indemnified Parties harmless against any Environmental Losses not
    related to the environmental matters set forth in Section 8.2(a)(i) of the
    Disclosure Schedule arising out of the matters described in Section
    8.2(a)(i)(A)&#45;(D) up to a maximum amount of (x) twenty million
    dollars ($20,000,000) for Environmental Losses related to the Dover
    Municipal Landfill located in Dover, New Hampshire and the Cardinal Landfill
    located in Farmington, New Hampshire; provided, however, if the Parent
    Indemnified Parties Environmental Losses exceed twenty million dollars, then
    Holdings and C&A Products shall jointly and severally indemnify the
    Parent Indemnified Parties for 50% of all Environmental Losses in excess of
    twenty million dollars, and (y) five million dollars ($5,000,000) for all
    other such Environmental Losses (other than any Environmental Losses
    relating to THI or any of its Subsidiaries incurred by the Parent
    Indemnified Parties prior to the earlier of (A) the first date that Holdings
    or C&A Products is required to account for THI and its Subsidiaries on a
    consolidated basis and (B) the date the Put Notice is delivered pursuant to
    Section 5.20(c)). For avoidance of doubt, any amounts paid by Holdings
    pursuant to this Section 8.2(j) shall be deemed to be Environmental Losses
    incurred by the Holdings Indemnified Parties for purposes of the limits set
    forth in sections 8.2(a)(iii) and 8.2(a)(iv).</p>
    <p>(vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if a Holdings
    Indemnified Party has a claim pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i)(D) of this
    Agreement, Parent shall indemnify the Holdings Indemnified Parties with
    respect to (A) any claims for fines or penalties arising out of said
    noncompliance and (B) Environmental Losses arising out of any expenditures
    made or actions taken by or on behalf of Holdings or C&A Products after
    the Closing Date to correct such noncompliance, but only to the extent that
    the Environmental Losses relate to the least expensive, commercially
    reasonable alternative necessary to correct such noncompliance; <u>provided</u>,
    that Holdings shall not make any claim against Parent pursuant to this
    Section 8.2(a)(vi)(B) which individually does not exceed fifty thousand
    dollars ($50,000) with respect to any single occurrence of noncompliance; <u>provided</u>,
    <u>further</u>, that with respect to any single occurrence of noncompliance,
    Parent shall only be liable for such Environmental Losses in excess of fifty
    thousand dollars ($50,000). If Holdings or C&A Products elects to
    correct such noncompliance by any means other than the least expensive,
    commercially reasonable alternative, subject to the provisions of this
    Section 8.2, Parent shall indemnify the Holdings Indemnified Parties for
    Environmental Losses up to an amount equal to the difference between the
    Environmental Losses that otherwise would have been incurred if the least
    expensive, commercially reasonable alternative had been implemented and five
    hundred thousand dollars ($500,000). Further, with respect to claims
    pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i)(D) which involve a violation that commenced
    prior to the Closing Date and continues after the Closing Date,
    Parent&#39;s indemnification obligation with respect to such continuing
    violation shall apply only with respect to the time period prior to the
    Closing Date. Notwithstanding the above, the foregoing shall not be
    interpreted to preclude the Holdings Indemnified Parties from
    indemnification with respect to the Remediation of Hazardous Substances that
    are present on or before the Closing Date in any environmental media at, on,
    under or migrating from or to, any Bison Property, as otherwise provided in
    this Agreement, including with respect to Hazardous Substances that were
    discharged into the environment prior to the Closing Date and continue to
    exist in the environment after the Closing Date.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>(b) With respect to claims to indemnify Holdings Indemnified Parties that are
described by Section 8.2(a)(i)(A):</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) Parent shall only be required to indemnify Holdings Indemnified
    Parties to the extent that, after the deductible set forth in Section
    8.2(a)(iii) is met: (A) the Remediation of the Hazardous Substances is
    required pursuant to an applicable Environmental Law that is in effect as of
    the Closing Date; (B) the Remediation Standards applicable to the
    Remediation are the most cost effective Remediation Standards required under
    Environmental Law assuming continued industrial use of the property, <u>provided</u>,
    that it is a Bison Property and where it is not, such other use then
    associated with such non&#45;Bison Property; and (C) the Remediation
    shall be conducted in a reasonable, cost effective manner consistent with
    applicable Environmental Law or as may be otherwise required by a
    Governmental Authority. Holdings shall accept appropriate engineering
    controls or institutional controls, including, if necessary, deed
    restrictions limiting property to an industrial use or limitations on the
    drilling and use of water wells on Bison Properties (individually or
    collectively, a &quot;Restriction&quot;), if such controls are needed in
    order to complete a Remediation consistent with the use of the least
    stringent Remediation Standards. Holdings shall not be required to consent
    to any Restriction in connection with completing a Remediation if the
    Restriction would materially impair or otherwise unreasonably interfere with
    the continued operations of the Bison Subsidiary or if the Governmental
    Authority having jurisdiction for such matter does not approve of reliance
    on such Restriction.</p>
    <p>(ii) For the sole purpose of seeking indemnification for Environmental
    Losses pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) of this Agreement, after the Closing
    Date, neither Holdings nor its Affiliates shall undertake any effort to
    discover whether there has been a release of Hazardous Substances at, on,
    underneath or migrating from any Bison Property, including the collection of
    soil, groundwater, or surface water samples or samples of other
    environmental media, except that Holdings or its authorized representatives
    may take such samples <u>and</u> the Holdings Indemnified Parties may seek
    indemnification therefore if: (A) required pursuant to an applicable
    Environmental Law or a lawful order of a Governmental Authority; (B)
    required by a potential acquirer of said Bison Property or the Business or a
    lessee of said Bison Property; (C) required in connection with defending
    against or pursuing a Third Party Claim; or (D) required by
    Holdings&#39; or C&A Products&#39; lender or financial
    underwriter prior to five years from the Closing Date. If Holdings fails to
    comply in any material respect with this provision, Parent shall have no
    obligation to provide any Holdings Indemnified Party with an indemnity for
    the Remediation of Hazardous Substances on such Bison Property or for any
    Claims for bodily injury or property damage related to Hazardous Substances
    on such property; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that this limitation on
    indemnification shall apply only the extent that any Environmental Losses
    incurred by a Holdings Indemnified Party for which indemnification is sought
    are identified solely as a result of such material noncompliance.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(c) Claims brought pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall be subject to the
procedures for indemnification set forth in Section 8.1(g) if such Claims are
Third Party Claims. Claims that involve or also involve the Remediation of
Hazardous Substances at any Bison Property shall also be subject to the
procedures set forth in Section 8.2(f).</p>
<p>(d) If Holdings or any of its Affiliates intends to sell, lease or otherwise
convey any Bison Subsidiary or any Bison Property, Holdings or said Affiliate
shall include, as a condition of such sale, lease or other agreement, terms and
conditions that will ensure that all Restrictions that have been accepted with
respect to the Bison Property are not disturbed (or, if such Restrictions will
be disturbed, that they will be restored at the expense of the party causing the
disturbance or, if additional Remediation is required as a result of the
disturbance of such Restrictions, that such additional Remediation will be
performed at the sole cost and expense of the party causing the disturbance).</p>
<p>(e) For purposes of this Agreement: (1) the term &quot;Environmental
Losses&quot; shall only include the following costs and expenses (after giving
effect to any related reduction in Taxes and amounts recovered from third
parties, including amounts recovered under insurance policies, with respect to
such Environmental Losses): (A) costs and expenses to implement a Remediation;
(B) damages for third party bodily injury and third party property damage; (C)
fines and penalties; and (D) reasonable attorneys&#39; fees,
consultants&#39; fees and expenses associated with (A), (B) or (C),
including costs and expenses associated with Litigation; (2) the term
&quot;Remediation Standard&quot; means a numerical standard (whether resulting
from an enacted statute, promulgated regulation, guidance or policy document
issued by a Governmental Authority, or developed on a
case&#45;by&#45;case basis through a risk assessment or other
methodology authorized pursuant to an applicable Environmental Law and, if
appropriate, approved by a Governmental Authority) that defines the
concentrations of Hazardous Substances that may be permitted to remain in any
environmental media after an investigation, remediation or containment of a
release of Hazardous Substances; (3) the term &quot;Remediation&quot; means any
action of any kind to investigate and/or clean up and/or otherwise respond a
release of Hazardous Substances into an environmental medium, including the
following activities: (A) monitoring, investigation, assessment, treatment,
cleanup, containment, removal, mitigation, remediation, corrective action,
response or restoration work; (B) obtaining any permits, consents, approvals or
authorizations of any Governmental Authority necessary to conduct any such
activity; (C) preparing and implementing any plans or studies for any such
activity; and (D) obtaining a written notice from a Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over the site being addressed under Environmental Laws that no
additional work is required by such Governmental Authority; and (4) the term
&quot;Off&#45;Site Location&quot; means any location other than (x) any
Bison Property or (y) property adjacent to any Bison Property which has been
impacted by a release of Hazardous Substances at, on, under or from any Bison
Property.</p>
<p>(f) <u>Procedures for Remedial Actions</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) Parent shall be entitled to assume control of Remediations at or with
    respect to any Bison Property (other than the Dover Municipal Landfill and
    the Cardinal Landfill) if the deductible set forth in Section 8.2(a)(iii) is
    met. The election of Parent to assume control of any such Remediation shall
    be made within a reasonable time. In the event that Parent shall control any
    Remediation, it shall promptly provide copies to Holdings of all notices,
    correspondence, draft reports, submissions, draft and final work plans and
    final reports and shall give Holdings a reasonable opportunity (at
    Holding&#39;s own expense) to comment on any submissions Parent intends
    to deliver or submit to the appropriate regulatory body prior to said
    submission. The party not controlling any Remediation may, at its own
    expense, hire its own consultants, attorneys or other professionals to
    monitor the work performed by the party controlling such Remediation,
    including any field work undertaken by such party. Notwithstanding the
    foregoing, Parent and Holdings, as applicable, agree to cooperate with each
    other, directly and through their respective consultants and counsel, to
    effect the successful completion of the Remediation within such period as
    may be specified by a Governmental Authority or under applicable
    Environmental Laws, or otherwise within a reasonable period of time; <u>provided</u>,
    <u>however</u>, that neither party shall take any actions that could
    unreasonably delay or unreasonably interfere with the performance of the
    work of the party controlling any Remediation.</p>
    <p>(ii) If Holdings or C&A Products is required to or desires to
    undertake a Remediation at or with respect to the Dover Municipal Landfill
    or the Cardinal Landfill that either Holdings or Parent determines is
    reasonably likely to cause the deductible set forth in Section 8.2(a)(iv) to
    be met, then Holdings shall notify Parent prior to undertaking such
    Remediation, and Parent and Holdings shall consult with each other, in good
    faith, to implement a mutually agreeable course of action to effect such
    Remediation. In the event of such determination, Holdings or C&A
    Products shall promptly provide copies to Parent of all notices,
    correspondence, draft reports, submissions, draft and final work plans and
    final reports and shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity (at
    Parent&#39;s expense) to comment on any submissions Holdings intends to
    deliver or submit to the appropriate regulatory body prior to said
    submission. Parent may, at its own expense, hire its own consultants,
    attorneys or other professionals to monitor the work performed by Holdings
    or C&A Products, including any field work undertaken by Holdings. Parent
    and Holdings, as applicable, agree to cooperate with each other, directly
    and through their respective consultants and counsel, to effect the
    successful completion of the Remediation within such period as may be
    specified by a Governmental Authority or under applicable Environmental
    Laws, or otherwise within a reasonable period of time; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
    that neither party shall take any actions that could unreasonably delay or
    unreasonably interfere with the performance of the Remediation.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(g) <u>Exclusive Remedy for Environmental Matters; Indemnification by
Holdings</u>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Holdings and C&A Products hereby agree that their sole and exclusive remedy
against any Parent Indemnified Party with respect to any and all Losses arising
under or related to any Environmental Law or any Hazardous Substances or the
environment, including statutory or common law claims for Environmental Losses,
damages, fines, penalties or response costs related to Hazardous Substances or
the environment, in connection with the Bison Subsidiaries, shall be the
indemnity set forth in this Section 8.2. Except with respect to the remedy
referred to in the preceding sentence, Holdings and C&A Products hereby
waive, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, and forever
releases the Parent Indemnified Parties, in connection with the Bison
Subsidiaries from, and shall indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties against,
any and all Environmental Losses arising under or related to Environmental Laws
or Hazardous Substances. Parent Indemnified Parties shall not make any claim
against Holdings for indemnification for any Loss, including any Environmental
Loss, pursuant to this Section 8.2(g) which individually does not exceed fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000). Holdings&#39; obligation to indemnify the Parent
Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Section 8.2(g) shall be limited to those
matters as to which Parent provides Holdings with written notice of said Claim
in the manner set forth in Section 8.1(e).</p>
<p>(h) <u>Disputes</u>. In the event of any dispute between Parent and Holdings
or C&A Products concerning a Claim for indemnification for Environmental
Losses under this Section 8.2 which cannot be resolved within thirty (30) days,
such dispute shall be promptly referred to an independent third party having
expertise in the matters at issue and mutually acceptable to the parties (or if
the parties cannot agree, the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution, in New York,
New York shall select a recognized expert who shall be independent from each of
the parties), whose fees and expenses shall be shared equally by the parties,
and who shall evaluate the facts and circumstances at issue and recommend a
course of action that the expert believes in its good faith judgment satisfies
the requirements of this Agreement and applicable Environmental Laws. Such
recommendations shall be final and binding on the parties. The parties agree to
act as promptly as practicable in implementing the foregoing procedures; <u>provided</u>,
<u>however</u>, that in the event that actions are required to be taken by a
Governmental Authority or in an emergency to avoid imminent and substantial harm
to health or the environment before the foregoing procedures can be implemented,
Holdings or C&A Products may undertake such actions without prejudice to its
rights under this Section 8.2 to seek indemnification for Environmental Losses.
In all other situations, Holdings&#39; or C&A Products&#39; failure
to comply with the requirements of this Section 8.2(h) shall not limit or reduce
the obligations of Parent under this Agreement except to the extent Parent is
actually and materially prejudiced thereby.</p>
<p>(i) <u>Other</u>. Nothing contained in this Section 8.2 shall restrict
Holdings or C&A Products from taking any action (and, if appropriate
pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i), seeking indemnification therefore) where required
to be taken by any Governmental Authority or in an emergency to avoid imminent
and substantial harm to health or the environment.</p>

of such series to be available for issuance from time to time as provided for in
Sections&#160;1(b) and 7(d) and each series of Series&#160;B Redeemable
Preferred Stock shall be further constituted (a) by up to an additional

Section&#160;1(b), Section&#160;7(d) and Section&#160;5(e), the
Company shall only issue the shares of the Series&#160;A2 Redeemable
Preferred Stock, the Series&#160;B2 Redeemable Preferred Stock and the
Series&#160;C2 Redeemable Preferred Stock to the Holders of the
Series&#160;A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Series&#160;B1 Redeemable
Preferred Stock and the Series&#160;C1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, as

provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement.</p>
<p>(b) In the event that the Company shall be required to pay Liquidated Damages
pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement and shall elect to pay such
Liquidated Damages in kind, on each Dividend Payment Date the Company shall
issue to each Holder entitled to Liquidated Damages in respect of shares of a
series of Redeemable Preferred Stock held by such Holder such number of newly
issued shares of such series of Redeemable Preferred Stock as is equal to
(x)&#160;the Liquidated Damages then due to such Holder in respect of shares
of Redeemable Preferred Stock of such series held by such Holder, divided by
(y)&#160;the Liquidation Preference plus Total Cash Dividends in Arrears
(inclusive of Additional Dividends and accrued regular dividends from the
preceding Dividend Payment Date if not concurrently paid or accrued in
accordance with the terms hereof) in respect of each share of Redeemable
Preferred Stock of such series as of such Dividend Payment Date. Each newly
issued share of Redeemable Preferred Stock of a series issued to a Holder shall
be identical in all respects, including Liquidation Preference and Total Cash
Dividends in Arrears, to all other shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock of the
same series held by such Holder. In lieu of any issuing any fractional shares of
Redeemable Preferred Stock of any series, the Company may deliver to a Holder an
amount in cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the amount set forth in
clause&#160;(y) of the preceding sentence with respect to such series.</p>
<p>(c) In the event that the Company shall be permitted, in accordance with the
terms of the Purchase Agreement, to satisfy all or a portion of the
Earn&#45;Out Amount, if any, in additional shares of Series B Redeemable
Preferred Stock, the Company may issue such number of additional shares of
Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock having at the time of payment an aggregate
Liquidation Preference plus Total Cash Dividends in Arrears (inclusive of any
Additional Dividends accruing from the most recent Dividend Payment Date) plus
accrued regular dividends equal to the Earn&#45;Out Amount or portion
thereof that the Company is permitted to so satisfy under the terms of the
Purchase Agreement. If any Series&#160;B Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance, all newly issued shares of
Series&#160;B Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be of the same series as all
other outstanding shares of Series&#160;B Redeemable Preferred Stock at such
time and identical to such outstanding shares in all respects, including as to
Liquidation Preference, Total Cash Dividends in Arrears (inclusive of any
Additional Dividends accruing from the most recent Dividend Payment Date),
accrued regular dividends and, if previously obtained with respect to
outstanding Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock, CUSIP number. If no shares of
Series&#160;B Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be outstanding immediately
prior to such issuance, all newly issued shares of Series&#160;B Redeemable
Preferred Stock shall be issued with a Liquidation Preference of $1,000.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, if the Company is
not able to issue Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock in satisfaction of the
Earn&#45;Out Amount as contemplated by the preceding paragraph because for
tax purposes such newly issued shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock
would not be fungible with previously outstanding shares of Series B Redeemable
Preferred Stock, then in lieu of issuing shares Series B Redeemable Preferred
Stock in satisfaction of the Earn&#45;Out Amount, the Company may, without
the consent of any Holder, create a new series of Redeemable Preferred Stock, to
be designated &quot;Series D Redeemable Preferred Stock,&quot; identical to the
Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock in all respects, having an initial
Liquidation Preference of $1,000 per share, and, if required pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement, provisions to the effect that (x) the Series D Redeemable
Preferred Stock shall be optionally redeemable by the Company at any time, at a
Redemption Price equal to 100% of the Liquidation Preference thereof plus any
Total Cash Dividends in Arrears (inclusive of Additional Dividends accruing from
the most recent Dividend Payment Date) and accrued regular dividends, (y) the
Series D Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be mandatorily redeemable, at the
Redemption Price set forth in the preceding clause (x), within 30 days following
any date upon which the Company would be permitted to redeem all or a portion of
the Series D Redeemable Preferred Stock without causing a Material Breach by the
Company or Parent, whether in one instance or as permitted from time to time
(the foregoing clause (x) and (y) being the &quot;Redemption Terms&quot;) and
(z) the Series D Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option
of the Holder, from time to time, in whole or in part, into shares of Series B
Redeemable Preferred Stock having the terms set forth in the second and third
sentences, as applicable, of the immediately preceding paragraph.</p>
<p>SECTION 2. <u>Dividends</u>. (a)&#160;&#160;Subject to
Section&#160;7(d) in the case of Textron Shares only, all shares of
Redeemable Preferred Stock will bear dividends, whether or not earned or
declared, out of funds legally available therefor, from the Issuance Date
thereof accruing on the Liquidation Preference thereof at the rate of
(x)&#160;(I) for all dividend periods ending on or before July 1, 2003, 11%
per annum, and (II) for all dividend periods ending after July 1, 2003, 15% per
annum (the &quot;<b>Series&#160;A Dividend Rate</b>&quot;) in the case of
the Series&#160;A Redeemable Preferred Stock, (y)&#160;(I) for all
dividend periods ending on or before July 1, 2003, 12% per annum, and (II) for
all dividend periods ending after July 1, 2003, 16% per annum (the &quot;<b>Series&#160;B
Dividend Rate</b>&quot;) in the case of the Series&#160;B Redeemable
Preferred Stock and (z)&#160;(I) for all dividend periods ending on or
before July 1, 2003, 12% per annum, and (II) for all dividend periods ending
after July 1, 2003, 16% per annum (the &quot;<b>Series&#160;C Dividend Rate</b>&quot;
and, together with the Series&#160;A Dividend Rate and the Series&#160;B
Dividend Rate, the &quot;<b>Dividend Rate</b>&quot;) in the case of the
Series&#160;C Redeemable Preferred Stock and, in each case, will be payable
quarterly in arrears on each Dividend Payment Date, commencing on
April&#160;1, 2002, to Holders of record on the March&#160;15,
June&#160;15, September&#160;15 and December&#160;15 immediately
preceding the relevant Dividend Payment Date. In calculating the amount of
dividends due on any Dividend Payment Date, the Liquidation Preference utilized
shall be the Liquidation Preference in effect on the first business day
following the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date. The Company may, at
its option and without notice, elect to accrue (x) at any time, up to (but not
more than) an amount (rounded to the nearest $.01) equivalent to 7% per annum of
the dividends on the Series&#160;A Redeemable Preferred Stock payable on any
Dividend Payment Date and up to (but not more than) an amount (rounded to the
nearest $.01) equivalent to 8% per annum of the dividends on each of the
Series&#160;B Redeemable Preferred Stock and the Series&#160;C
Redeemable Preferred Stock payable on any Dividend Payment Date or (y) at all
times through and including the dividend period ending and Dividend Payment Date
on January 1, 2004 during which the payment of cash dividends on Redeemable
Preferred Stock would result in a Material Breach by the Company or Parent, up
to the full amount of all dividends on each series of Redeemable Preferred Stock
payable on any Dividend Payment Date, but only to the extent necessary to
prevent any such breach from occurring (with any amounts payable in cash being
paid on a pro rata basis (based on aggregate Liquidation Preference) as among
each series of Redeemable Preferred Stock); in each case in lieu of payment of
such dividends in cash and, in each such case, any such accrued dividends
(respectively, the &quot;<b>Series&#160;A Accrued Dividends,&quot;
&quot;Series&#160;B Accrued Dividends</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>Series&#160;C
Accrued Dividends</b>&quot;) will be added to the Liquidation Preference of the
applicable series of Redeemable Preferred Stock. Additional dividends are
payable in cash in respect of Series&#160;A Redeemable Preferred Stock
constituting Textron Shares as provided in Section&#160;7(d) (&quot;<b>Liquidity
Dividends</b>&quot;); provided that at all times through and including the
dividend period ending and Dividend Payment Date on January 1, 2004 during which
the payment of cash Liquidity Dividends on Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock
would result in a Material Breach by the Company or Parent, the Company may,
without notice, elect to accrue up to all Liquidity Dividends payable on Series
A Redeemable Preferred Stock payable on any Dividend Payment Date (but only to
the extent necessary to prevent any such breach from occurring), with any such
accrual being added to the Series A Accrued Dividends for the relevant period.
Dividends shall cease to accumulate in respect of the shares of Redeemable
Preferred Stock upon their redemption unless the Company shall have failed to
pay the relevant redemption price on the Redemption Date.</p>
<p>(b) All dividends (including pursuant to Section&#160;2(f)) paid with
respect to shares of the Redeemable Preferred Stock pursuant to this Certificate
of Designation shall be paid <i>pro</i> <i>rata</i> to the Holders entitled
thereto.</p>
<p>(c) Dividends with respect to Redeemable Preferred Stock are payable when, as
and if declared by the Board of Directors, and nothing contained in this
Certificate of Designation shall in any way or under any circumstances be
construed or deemed to require the Board of Directors to declare, or the Company
to pay or set apart for payment, any dividends on shares of the Redeemable
Preferred Stock at any time. Dividends on the Redeemable Preferred Stock will
accrue whether or not the Company has earnings or profits, whether or not there
are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends and whether or not
dividends are declared. The accrual of dividends as Series&#160;A Accrued
Dividends, Series&#160;B Accrued Dividends or Series&#160;C Accrued
Dividends as permitted by Section&#160;2(a) shall be deemed to be a payment
of dividends and shall fulfill the Company&#39;s obligations with respect to
the payment of such portion of the dividends payable upon the Redeemable
Preferred Stock for all purposes hereof. Other dividends will accumulate to the
extent they are not paid on the Dividend Payment Date for the period to which
they relate as Cash Dividends in Arrears and accumulated and unpaid dividends
which are required to be paid in cash will bear Additional Dividends until paid
on the same basis as set forth in Section&#160;2(a) of this Certificate of
Designation, compounded quarterly on each Dividend Payment Date.</p>
<p>(d) Subject to the Company&#39;s option to accrue a portion of the
dividends provided for in Section&#160;2(a), Holders shall be entitled to
receive the cash dividends provided for in this Certificate of Designation
(including the Total Cash Dividends in Arrears) in preference to and in priority
over any cash dividends (including accumulated and unpaid dividends) payable
upon any Junior Securities.</p>
<p>(e) At the Issuance Date of the Series&#160;A2 Redeemable Preferred Stock
and the Series&#160;B2 Redeemable Preferred Stock and the Series&#160;C2
Redeemable Preferred Stock, such shares shall be issued with Total Cash
Dividends in Arrears and accumulated and unpaid dividends for the then current
dividend period equal to that of the Series&#160;A1 Redeemable Preferred
Stock, the Series&#160;B1 Redeemable Preferred Stock and the
Series&#160;C1 Redeemable Preferred Stock for which it is exchanged pursuant
to the Registration Rights Agreement.</p>
<p>(f) At any time and from time to time when there shall be Total Cash
Dividends in Arrears, the Company may declare and pay, to the Holders of record
of the Redeemable Preferred Stock on any record date chosen by the Company
(which record date shall be not less than 10 and not more than 60 days prior to
the payment date for such special dividend) for such dividends, a special
dividend per share of Redeemable Preferred Stock equal to all or a portion of
the Total Cash Dividends in Arrears as of the payment date. Upon payment of such
a dividend, if less than the Total Cash Dividends in Arrears with respect to a
share has been paid, the Cash Dividends in Arrears and Additional Dividends with
respect to such share shall be reduced on a <i>pro rata</i> basis by the amount
of such dividend.</p>
<p>(g) No full dividends may be declared or paid or funds set apart for the
payment of dividends on, and the Company shall not make any other distribution
with respect to, any Parity Securities for any period unless the entire Total
Cash Dividends in Arrears for all issued and outstanding shares of Redeemable
Preferred Stock shall have been declared and paid in full, except as provided
below. If at any time there shall exist Total Cash Dividends in Arrears, the
Redeemable Preferred Stock will share dividends <i>pro rata </i>with the Parity
Securities (on the basis of the relative unpaid amount of Cash Dividends in
Arrears and Additional Dividends, in the case of the Redeemable Preferred Stock
and of cumulative accrued and unpaid dividends, in the case of such Parity
Securities).</p>
<p>(h) Cash Dividends in Arrears, Additional Dividends and other dividends in
connection with any redemption may be declared and paid at any time, without
reference to any regular Dividend Payment Date, to Holders of record of the
Redeemable Preferred Stock on such date, not more than 60 days prior to the
payment thereof, as may be fixed by the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>(i) Dividends payable on the Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be computed on
the basis of a 360&#45;day year of twelve 30&#45;day months and the
actual number of days elapsed in the period for which dividends are payable and
shall be deemed to accrue on a daily basis.</p>
<p>SECTION 3. <u>Liquidation Preference</u>.&#160;&#160;Upon any
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding&#45;up of the
Company, Holders will be entitled to be paid, out of the assets of the Company
available for distribution to stockholders, the Liquidation Preference per share
of Redeemable Preferred Stock, plus, without duplication, an amount in cash
equal to all accumulated and unpaid dividends (including any Total Cash
Dividends in Arrears), if any, thereon to the date fixed for liquidation,
dissolution or winding&#45;up (including an amount equal to a prorated
dividend for the period from the last Dividend Payment Date to the date fixed
for liquidation, dissolution or winding&#45;up), plus, in the case of the
Series&#160;C Redeemable Preferred Stock only, an amount in cash equal to
the Common Participation Amount, before any distribution is made on any Junior
Securities, including, without limitation, on any Common Stock of the Company.
If, upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding&#45;up of the Company, the amounts payable with respect to the
Redeemable Preferred Stock and all other Parity Securities are not paid in full,
the Holders of the Redeemable Preferred Stock and the holders of the Parity
Securities will share equally and ratably in any distribution of assets of the
Company in proportion to their relative liquidation preferences, together with
all accumulated and unpaid dividends to which each is entitled. After payment of
the full amount of the Liquidation Preference and, without duplication,
accumulated and unpaid dividends (including any Total Cash Dividends in Arrears)
to which they are entitled, and, in the case of the Series&#160;C Redeemable
Preferred Stock only, an amount in cash equal to the Common Participation
Amount, Holders will not be entitled to any further participation in any
distribution of assets of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Series&#160;A Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Series&#160;B Redeemable
Preferred Stock and the Series&#160;C Redeemable Preferred Stock shall
constitute Parity Securities with respect to one another. For the purposes of
this Section&#160;3, neither the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for
cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or
substantially all of the property or assets of the Company nor the consolidation
or merger of the Company with one or more entities shall be deemed to be a
liquidation, dissolution or winding&#45;up of the Company. Any payment of
accumulated and unpaid dividends shall be paid prior to any other payments
called for pursuant to this Section 3.</p>
<p>SECTION 4. <u>Voting Rights</u>. (a)&#160;&#160;Holders shall be
entitled to vote on any matter required or permitted to be voted upon generally
by the holders of Common Stock of the Company and such vote shall represent an
aggregate voting power equal to 2% of the voting power of the Company&#39;s
outstanding Common Stock.</p>
<p>(b) In addition, if (i)&#160;after January&#160;1, 2003, there shall
exist any Total Cash Dividends in Arrears remaining in arrears and unpaid for
any two consecutive quarterly dividend periods; (ii)&#160;the Company fails
to discharge its obligation to redeem Redeemable Preferred Stock on any
Redemption Date to the extent required by Section&#160;5; (iii)&#160;the
Company fails to make a Par Offer if such offer is required by the second
paragraph of Section&#160;7(d) hereof or fails to purchase shares of
Series&#160;A Redeemable Preferred Stock from Holders who elect to have such
shares purchased pursuant to such Par Offer; (iv)&#160;a breach or violation
of any other provisions contained in Section&#160;7 hereof occurs and the
breach or violation continues for a period of 45 days or more after the Company
receives notice thereof specifying the default from the Holders of at least 25%
of the shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock then outstanding; (v) Indebtedness
of the Company and/or any Restricted Subsidiary having an individual or
aggregate outstanding principal amount of $25,000,000 or more is declared due
and payable following an event of default prior to its scheduled stated maturity
or is not paid in full upon its scheduled stated maturity; (vi)&#160;a
decree or order is entered by a court having jurisdiction in the premises
granting relief in respect of any Significant Subsidiary in any involuntary case
under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, adjudging such Significant Subsidiary a
bankrupt, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of any Significant
Subsidiary under any Bankruptcy Law, or appointing a receiver, liquidator,
custodian, assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of any
Significant Subsidiary, or of substantially all of its properties, or ordering
the winding&#45;up or liquidation of its affairs under any such law, and any
such decree or order continues unstayed and in effect for a period of 60
consecutive days; or (vii)&#160; any Significant Subsidiary institutes
proceedings to be adjudicated a bankrupt, or any Significant Subsidiary consents
to the institution of bankruptcy proceedings against it, or any Significant
Subsidiary files a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or
relief under any Bankruptcy Law, or any Significant Subsidiary consents to the
filing of any such petition or to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator,
custodian, assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of any
Significant Subsidiary, or of substantially all of its properties under any such
law, then, in each such case, the Holders of the majority of the then
outstanding affected series of Redeemable Preferred Stock (voting or consenting,
as the case may be, as one class to the extent such Voting Rights Triggering
Event relates to both series of Redeemable Preferred Stock) will be entitled to
elect two members of the Board of Directors of the Company; <i>provided</i>, <i>however</i>,
that in no event shall such Holders be entitled to elect more than two such
members. Such voting rights will continue until such time as (x)&#160;in the
case of a dividend default described in clause&#160;(i) above, all Total
Cash Dividends in Arrears on the Redeemable Preferred Stock are paid in full,
(y)&#160;in the case of an event described in clause&#160;(v) above, any
such acceleration or event of default has been rescinded, cured or waived or the
Indebtedness relating to such acceleration has been paid, redeemed, repurchased
or defeased in full and (z)&#160;in all other cases, any failure, breach,
default or event giving rise to such voting rights is remedied, cured or waived
by the Holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding affected series of
Redeemable Preferred Stock (voting or consenting, as the case may be, as one
class to the extent such Voting Rights Triggering Event relates to both series
of Redeemable Preferred Stock), after which time the term of the directors

event described in clauses&#160;(i) through (vii) above is referred to
herein as a &quot;<b>Voting Rights Triggering Event</b>.&quot;</p>
<p>(c) The Company shall not modify, change, affect or amend (including in
connection with a merger or consolidation, except to the limited extent
contemplated by Section&#160;7(e)) the Certificate of Incorporation or this
Certificate of Designation to affect materially and adversely the specified
rights, preferences, privileges or voting rights of the Holders of the
Redeemable Preferred Stock, or authorize the issuance of any additional shares
of Redeemable Preferred Stock, without the affirmative vote or consent of
Holders of at least a majority of the shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock then
outstanding, voting or consenting, as the case may be, as one class. In
addition, the Company shall not authorize, create (by way of reclassification,
merger, consolidation or otherwise) or issue (i)&#160;any Parity Securities,
or any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to
purchase any Parity Securities, without the affirmative vote or consent of the
Holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Redeemable Preferred
Stock except as expressly contemplated hereby, (ii)&#160;any Senior
Securities, or any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the
right to purchase Senior Securities, without the affirmative vote or consent of
the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Redeemable
Preferred Stock and (iii)&#160;any Junior Securities constituting
Disqualified Stock, or any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing
the right to purchase Junior Securities constituting Disqualified Stock, without
the affirmative vote or consent of the Holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of the Redeemable Preferred Stock, in each case voting or
consenting, as the case may be, as one class. Except as expressly set forth
above, (i)&#160;the creation, authorization or issuance of any shares of
Junior Securities, Parity Securities or Senior Securities, including the
designation of series thereof within the existing class of Preferred Stock of
the Company, or (ii)&#160;the increase or decrease in the amount of
authorized Capital Stock of any class, including any Preferred Stock of the
Company (other than the Redeemable Preferred Stock), shall not require the
consent of the Holders and shall not be deemed to affect materially and
adversely the specified rights, preferences, privileges or voting rights of
Holders. The affirmative vote or consent of Holders of at least a majority of
the then issued and outstanding shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be
required to increase the amount of authorized Redeemable Preferred Stock. No
vote of the Holders shall be required to decrease the number of authorized
shares of the Redeemable Preferred Stock; <i>provided</i>, <i>however</i>, that
such number shall not be decreased below the number of the then currently issued
and outstanding shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock.</p>
<p>(d) Immediately after voting power to elect directors shall have become
vested and be continuing in the Holders pursuant to Section&#160;4(b) or if
vacancies shall exist in the offices of directors elected by the Holders,
Holders of at least 10% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Redeemable
Preferred Stock or a proper officer of the Company shall call a special meeting
of the Holders for the purpose of electing the directors which such Holders are
entitled to elect. Any such meeting shall be held at the earliest practicable
date, and the Company shall provide Holders with access to the lists of Holders.
At any meeting held for the purpose of electing directors at which the Holders
shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect directors, the
presence in person or by proxy of the Holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be required to constitute
a quorum of such Holders.</p>
<p>(e) Any vacancy occurring in the office of a director elected by the Holders
shall be filled by the Holders.</p>
<p>(f) In any case in which the Holders shall be entitled to vote pursuant to
this Section&#160;4 or pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware, each Holder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of
Redeemable Preferred Stock held.</p>
<p>(g) Holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of
Redeemable Preferred Stock, voting or consenting, as the case may be, separately
as a single class, may waive compliance with any provision of this Certificate
of Designation.</p>

optional redemption may be made unless prior to such redemption any Total Cash
Dividends in Arrears shall have been fully paid on all shares of the Redeemable
Preferred Stock. If less than all the Redeemable Preferred Stock of any series
is to be redeemed, the particular shares of such series to be redeemed will be
determined <i>pro</i> <i>rata</i> among Holders of such series, except that the
Company may redeem such shares held by any Holder of fewer than 100 shares
without regard to such <i>pro</i> <i>rata</i> redemption requirement. If any
Redeemable Preferred Stock is to be redeemed in part, the Redemption Notice that
relates to such Redeemable Preferred Stock shall state the portion of the
Liquidation Preference to be redeemed. New shares of the same series of
Redeemable Preferred Stock having an aggregate Liquidation Preference equal to
the unredeemed portion will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon
cancellation of the original shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock.</p>
<p>(b) <u>Mandatory Redemption</u>. (i)&#160;&#160;The Company shall
redeem all outstanding Series&#160;A Redeemable Preferred Stock and
Series&#160;B Redeemable Preferred Stock (subject to the legal availability
of funds therefor) in whole on January&#160;1, 2013; <i>provided</i> that
such date shall be automatically changed upon the issuance of the Acquisition
Notes to be the date that is the first Business Day which is one year following
the final stated maturity date of the Acquisition Notes (without giving effect
to any amendment, modification or waiver thereof), at a redemption price equal
to 100% of the Liquidation Preference thereof, plus, without duplication, all
accumulated and unpaid dividends (including any Total Cash Dividends in
Arrears), if any, to the Maturity Redemption Date. The Company shall redeem all
outstanding Series&#160;C Redeemable Preferred Stock (subject to the legal
availability of funds therefor) in whole on February&#160;1, 2022, at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the Liquidation Preference thereof, plus,
without duplication, all accumulated and unpaid dividends (including any Total
Cash Dividends in Arrears), if any, to the Maturity Redemption Date, plus the
Common Participation Amount.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The
Company shall make an offer to redeem (a &quot;<b>Change of Control Offer</b>&quot;)
all outstanding Redeemable Preferred Stock (subject to legal availability of
funds therefor) not later than 60 days following a Change of Control (the &quot;<b>Change
of Control Redemption Date</b>&quot;) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
Liquidation Preference thereof, plus, without duplication, all accumulated and
unpaid dividends (including any Total Cash Dividends in Arrears), if any, to the
Change of Control Redemption Date, plus, in the case of the Series&#160;C
Redeemable Preferred Stock only, an amount equal to the Common Participation
Amount; <i>provided</i> that (A)&#160;no redemption under this
Section&#160;5(b)(ii) shall be required unless (i)&#160;all Existing
Notes shall have ceased to be outstanding, (ii)&#160;the Company shall have
consummated a defeasance with respect to the Existing Notes in accordance with
the terms thereof or (iii)&#160;the holders of Existing Notes shall have
consented to the Company&#39;s performance of its obligations under this
Section&#160;5(b)(ii) and (B)&#160;no redemption shall be effected until
after the Company has performed all of its obligations arising upon a
&quot;change of control&quot; under any debt instruments of the Company. The
Company shall not consummate a transaction resulting in a Change of Control
unless at the time of or prior to the Change of Control, the Company shall have
entered into customary financial and/or other arrangements which permit the
timely redemption of the Redeemable Preferred Stock under this
Section&#160;5(b)(ii) (disregarding the proviso of the preceding sentence).
The Company may (but shall not be obligated to) discharge any obligation arising
under this Section&#160;5(b)(ii) if a Person other than the Company (whether
or not an Affiliate) makes and consummates a Change of Control Offer in the
manner contemplated, and as required by, this Certificate of Designation.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In
the event of any Asset Disposition resulting in Net Cash Proceeds to the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary required by the terms of the Company&#39;s then
outstanding Indebtedness to be applied towards the repayment of, or any offer to
repay, any outstanding Indebtedness of the Company to the extent that such Net
Cash Proceeds are not applied by the Company within 365 days following such
Asset Disposition toward the repayment of any such Indebtedness or are not
reinvested in the business of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries within
365 days following such Asset Disposition, <i>first</i> the Company shall apply
such Net Cash Proceeds towards the making and consummation of any remaining
obligation to offer to purchase or other repayment of any outstanding
Indebtedness of the Company to the extent required by, and in accordance with,
the terms thereof, and towards any fees and expenses associated therewith, and, <i>second</i>,
to the extent that any Net Cash Proceeds remain after any such purchase or
repayment and payment of associated fees and expenses (such remaining proceeds
being &quot;<b>Net Available Proceeds</b>&quot;) and provided no default or
event of default would result under the terms of any Indebtedness of the
Company, the Company shall (a)&#160;declare a special dividend pursuant to
Section&#160;2(e) in an amount equal to the lesser of (x)&#160;the full
amount of the entire Total Cash Dividends in Arrears (together with all other
dividends payable in respect thereof) or (y)&#160;the amount of such Net
Available Proceeds, and (b) after fulfilling any obligations with respect to
special dividends referred to in the preceding clause (a), apply any remaining
Net Available Proceeds (&quot;<b>Remaining Net Available Proceeds</b>&quot;)
towards the making and consummation of an offer (an &quot;<b>Asset Disposition
Offer</b>&quot;) to redeem shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock, at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the Liquidation Preference thereof, plus, without
duplication, all accumulated and unpaid dividends (including any Total Cash
Dividends in Arrears), if any, to the redemption date (the &quot;<b>Asset
Disposition Redemption Date</b>&quot;), which shall be not more than 60 nor less
than 30 days following the Company&#39;s satisfaction of all obligations in
respect of such Asset Disposition and the application of the Net Cash Proceeds
therefrom required hereby to be performed prior to the making of an Asset
Disposition Offer, plus, in the case of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock
only, an amount equal to the Common Participation Amount. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the amount of Net Available Proceeds may be
recalculated to take account of the <i>pro rata</i> rights of any holders of
Parity Securities, if any.</p>
<p>(c) <u>Dividend Payment</u>. Any payment of accumulated and unpaid dividends
(including any dividends that have been added to the Liquidation Preference)
shall be declared and paid prior to the payment of any redemption price made
pursuant to this Section&#160;5. In addition, the Company shall declare and
pay a special dividend as provided in Section&#160;2(f) in respect of the
full amount of any Total Cash Dividends in Arrears prior to the payment of any
redemption price made pursuant to this Section&#160;5. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, this Section&#160;5(c) shall not result in
any requirement to make a duplicative payment upon any redemption hereunder.</p>
<p>(d) <u>Procedure for Redemptions</u>. (i)&#160;&#160;Not more than 60
and not less then 30 days prior to any Redemption Date (or, in the case of a
redemption pursuant to Section&#160;5(b)(ii), not more than 60 and not less
than 5 Business Days prior to any Redemption Date), written notice (the &quot;<b>Redemption
Notice</b>&quot;) shall be given by first&#45;class mail, postage prepaid,
to each Holder of record of shares to be redeemed on the record date fixed for
such redemption of the Redeemable Preferred Stock or entitled to the benefits of
a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, as the case may be, at
such Holder&#39;s address as the same appears on the stock register of the
Company; <i>provided</i>, <i>however</i>, that (1)&#160;a Redemption Notice
may be given with respect to a redemption pursuant to Section&#160;5(b)(ii)
on a basis that is conditioned upon and subject to the occurrence of a Change of
Control upon a date that may be subsequently changed (a &quot;<b>Conditional
Redemption Notice</b>&quot;) and (2)&#160;no failure to give such notice nor
any deficiency therein shall affect the validity of the procedure for the
redemption of any shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock to be redeemed except as
to the Holder or Holders to whom the Company has failed to give such notice or
except as to the Holder or Holders whose notice was defective. The Redemption
Notice shall state:</p>
<p>in the case of a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer only,
that a Change of Control has occurred or that Remaining Net Available Proceeds
resulting from an Asset Disposition exist, as the case may be, and that such
Holder has the right to require the Company to redeem such Holder&#39;s
Redeemable Preferred Stock at the within mentioned Redemption Price, in the case
of an Asset Disposition Offer, up to a maximum aggregate Redemption Price equal
to the Remaining Net Available Proceeds less the amount of fees and expenses
associated with the making and consummation of the Asset Disposition Offer;</p>
<p>the Redemption Price or, if unascertainable, how the Redemption Price will be
calculated;</p>
<p>in the case of an optional redemption only, whether all or less than all the
outstanding shares of a series of Redeemable Preferred Stock are to be redeemed
and the total number of shares of such Redeemable Preferred Stock being
redeemed;</p>
<p>in the case of an optional redemption only, the number and series of shares
of Redeemable Preferred Stock held by the Holder that the Company intends to
redeem;</p>
<p>in the case of an Asset Disposition Offer only, the aggregate Remaining Net
Available Proceeds available to redeem shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock
pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer and to pay fees and expenses associated
therewith;</p>
<p>in the case of an Asset Disposition Offer only, that any shares of Redeemable
Preferred Stock tendered in excess of the maximum number able to be repurchased
with the Remaining Net Available Proceeds (net of fees and expenses associated
with the Asset Disposition Offer) will be returned to the Holder and will be
treated for all purposes as if such shares had not been tendered for redemption,
and that in the event of such an excess tender, the Company shall select the
shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock to be redeemed as nearly as practicable on
a <i>pro rata</i> basis;</p>
<p>the Redemption Date or, in the case of a Conditional Redemption Notice, the
first possible and intended Redemption Date;</p>
<p>in the case of an optional redemption or maturity date redemption only, that
the Holder is to surrender to the Company, at the place or places that shall be
designated in such Redemption Notice, its certificates representing the shares
of Redeemable Preferred Stock to be redeemed;</p>
<p>in the case of a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer only,
that the Holder is to surrender to the Company, at the place or places that
shall be designated in such Redemption Notice, its certificates representing the
shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock that such Holder has elected to be
redeemed;</p>
<p>that dividends on the shares of any Redeemable Preferred Stock to be redeemed
shall cease to accumulate on the day prior to such Redemption Date unless the
Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price; and</p>
<p>the name of any bank or trust company performing the duties referred to in
subsection (d)(iv) below.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On
or before a Redemption Date, each Holder of Redeemable Preferred Stock to be
redeemed shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing such
shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock to the Company, in the manner and at the
place designated in the Redemption Notice, and on the Redemption Date the full
redemption price for such shares shall be payable in cash to the person whose
name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof, and each
surrendered certificate shall be returned to authorized but unissued shares. In
the event that less than all of the shares represented by any such certificate
are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed
shares.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On
and after the Redemption Date, unless the Company defaults in the payment in
full of the applicable redemption price, dividends on the Redeemable Preferred
Stock called or tendered for redemption shall cease to accumulate on the day
prior to the Redemption Date, and the Holders of such shares shall cease to have
any further rights with respect thereto on the Redemption Date, other than the
right to receive the redemption price, without interest.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(iv)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If
a Redemption Notice shall have been duly given or if the Company shall have
given to the bank or trust company hereinafter referred to irrevocable
authorization promptly to give such notice, and if on or before the Redemption
Date specified therein the funds necessary for such redemption shall have been
deposited by the Company with such bank or trust company in trust for the <i>pro</i>
<i>rata</i> benefit of the Holders of the Redeemable Preferred Stock called or
tendered for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for shares
so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, from
and after the time of such deposit, all shares so called or tendered, or to be
so called or tendered pursuant to such irrevocable authorization, for redemption
shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such
shares shall forthwith cease and terminate, except only the right of the Holders
thereof to receive from such bank or trust company at any time after the time of
such deposit the funds so deposited, without interest. The aforesaid bank or
trust company shall be organized and in good standing under the laws of the
United States of America or of any state within the United States, shall have
capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating at least $25,000,000 (a
&quot;<b>Qualified Bank</b>&quot;) and shall be identified in the Redemption
Notice. Any interest accrued on such funds from and after the Redemption Date
shall be paid to the Company from time to time. Any funds so set aside or
deposited, as the case may be, and unclaimed at the end of one year from such
Redemption Date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to
the Company, after which release or repayment the Holders of the shares so
called for redemption shall look only to the Company for payment thereof.</p>
<font SIZE="3">
<p>(e) <u>Exchange of Series&#160;C Redeemable Preferred Stock for
Series&#160;B Redeemable Preferred Stock</u>. At any time after the second
anniversary of the Issuance Date of the Series C1 Redeemable Preferred Stock but
prior to the third anniversary of the Issuance Date of the Series C1 Redeemable
Preferred Stock, at the option of the Company or upon the written request of
Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series&#160;C Redeemable
Preferred Stock, the Company shall exchange, in whole and not in part, all
outstanding shares of Series&#160;C Redeemable Preferred Stock for newly
issued shares of Series&#160;B Redeemable Preferred Stock. If any
Series&#160;B Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be outstanding immediately
prior to such exchange, all newly issued shares of Series&#160;B Redeemable
Preferred Stock shall be of the same series as all other outstanding shares of
Series&#160;B Redeemable Preferred Stock at such time and identical to such
outstanding shares in all respects, including as to Liquidation Preference,
Total Cash Dividends in Arrears (inclusive of any Additional Dividends accruing
from the most recent Dividend Payment Date), accrued regular dividends and, if
previously obtained with respect to outstanding Series B Redeemable Preferred
Stock, CUSIP number. If no shares of Series&#160;B Redeemable Preferred
Stock shall be outstanding immediately prior to such exchange, all newly issued
shares of Series&#160;B Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be issued with the
same Liquidation Preference, Total Cash Dividends in Arrears (inclusive of any
Additional Dividends accruing from the most recent Dividend Payment Date) and
accrued regular dividends as the shares of Series&#160;C Redeemable
Preferred Stock immediately prior to such exchange (and the Common Exchange
Factor shall be calculated on such basis). The ratio of exchange shall be one
share of Series&#160;B Redeemable Preferred Stock multiplied by the Common
Exchange Factor for each share of Series&#160;C Redeemable Preferred Stock
exchanged. In lieu of issuing any fractional shares of Series B Redeemable
Preferred Stock, the Company may deliver to a Holder an amount in cash equal to
such fraction multiplied by the sum of the Liquidation Preference plus Total
Cash Dividends in Arrears (inclusive of any Additional Dividends accruing from
the most recent Dividend Payment Date) plus accrued regular dividends in respect
of each share of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock being issued.</p>
</font>
<p>Not more than 60 and not less than 10 days prior to an exchange provided for
in the preceding paragraph , written notice (the &quot;<b>Exchange Notice</b>&quot;)
shall be given by first&#45;class mail, postage prepaid, to each Holder of
record of shares to be exchanged on the record date fixed for such exchange of
Series&#160;B Redeemable Preferred Stock for Series&#160;C Redeemable
Preferred Stock, at such Holder&#39;s address as the same appears on the
stock register of the Company; <i>provided</i>, <i>however</i>, that no failure
to give such notice nor any deficiency therein shall affect the validity of the
procedure for such exchange. The Exchange Notice shall state (i)&#160;the
date set for exchange, (ii)&#160;the method used to calculate the Common
Exchange Factor, (iii)&#160;that the Holder is to surrender to the Company,
at the place or places that shall be designated in such Exchange Notice, its
certificates representing the shares of Series&#160;C Redeemable Preferred
Stock to be exchanged, (iv)&#160;that following the date set for exchange,
such Holder&#39;s shares of Series&#160;C Redeemable Preferred Stock
shall cease to accrue dividends, whether or not submitted for exchange, and
(v)&#160;that following the date set for exchange, dividends on newly issued
shares of Series&#160;B Redeemable Preferred Stock shall accrue from the
most recent Dividend Payment Date.</p>
<p>SECTION 6. <u>Ranking</u>. The Redeemable Preferred Stock shall, with respect
to dividends and distributions upon liquidation, winding&#45;up and
dissolution of the Company, rank (a)&#160;senior to all classes of Common
Stock of the Company, and to each other class of Capital Stock or series of
Preferred Stock of the Company established after the Issuance Date of the
Series&#160;A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series&#160;B1 Redeemable
Preferred Stock and Series&#160;C1 Redeemable Preferred Stock the terms of
which expressly provide that it ranks junior to the Redeemable Preferred Stock
as to dividends and distributions upon liquidation, winding&#45;up and
dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to, together with all classes
of Common Stock of the Company, as &quot;<b>Junior Securities</b>&quot;),
(b)&#160;subject to any required approval of the Holders in accordance with
Section&#160;4(c) hereof, on a parity with each other class of Capital Stock
or series of Preferred Stock established after the Issuance Date of the
Series&#160;A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series&#160;B1 Redeemable
Preferred Stock and Series&#160;C1 Redeemable Preferred Stock the terms of
which expressly provide that such class or series will rank on a parity with the
Redeemable Preferred Stock as to dividends and distributions upon liquidation,
winding&#45;up and dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to as
&quot;<b>Parity Securities</b>&quot;), and (c)&#160;subject to any required
approval of the Holders in accordance with Section&#160;4(c) hereof, junior
to each class of Capital Stock or series of Preferred Stock established after
the Issuance Date of the Series&#160;A1 Redeemable Preferred Stock,
Series&#160;B1 Redeemable Preferred Stock and Series&#160;C1 Redeemable
Preferred Stock by the Board of Directors and the terms of which do not
expressly provide that such class or series will rank junior to, or on a parity
with, the Redeemable Preferred Stock as to dividends and distributions upon
liquidation, winding&#45;up and dissolution of the Company (collectively
referred to as &quot;<b>Senior Securities</b>&quot;). For the avoidance of
doubt, each series of Redeemable Preferred Stock shall constitute Parity
Securities with respect to one another.</p>
<p>SECTION 7. Certain Additional Provisions.</p>
<p>(a) <u>Limitation on Indebtedness</u>. The Company shall not Incur any
Indebtedness, and the Company shall not permit any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to Incur any Indebtedness, other than, in any such case, Permitted
Indebtedness; <i>provided</i> that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may
Incur Indebtedness if immediately after giving <i>pro forma</i><u> </u>effect
thereto and the use of the proceeds thereof (in accordance with the definition
of &quot;Consolidated Coverage Ratio&quot;), the Consolidated Coverage Ratio is
at least equal to
[&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;]:1.00.
<sup>a</p>
</sup>
<p>For purposes of determining compliance with this Section&#160;7(a),
(i)&#160;in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of
more than one of the types of Permitted Indebtedness or the provisions of the
first paragraph of this Section&#160;7(a), the Company in its sole
discretion may classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of
Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount of such Indebtedness as
one of such types and such item of Indebtedness may be divided and classified in
more than one of such types, (ii)&#160;the liquidation preference of any
Preferred Stock will be the amount of all obligations of such Person with
respect to the redemption of such Preferred Stock at its stated maturity or upon
liquidation or dissolution (whichever is greater) and (iii)&#160;in no event
shall the accrual of dividends or interest or issuance of
pay&#45;in&#45;kind dividends or interest subsequent to the issuance or
Incurrence of Indebtedness or Preferred Stock giving rise thereto constitute an
Incurrence required to be tested under this Section&#160;7(a).</p>
<font SIZE="3">
<p>(b) <u>Limitations on Restricted Payments</u>. Without limiting other
prohibitions in this Certificate of Designation (including

restrictions contained in any mortgage, security or lease agreement (including a
capital or operating lease) securing Indebtedness of a Subsidiary or relating to

that the provisions relating to such encumbrance or restriction at the time any
such agreement is entered into (i)&#160; are customary in similar agreement
entered into by persons of a comparable size and credit worthiness to the
Company and (ii)&#160;could not reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect the Company&#39;s ability to make required cash dividend
payments with respect to the Redeemable Preferred Stock or to redeem the
Redeemable Preferred Stock on the Maturity Redemption Date; or (I)&#160;any
encumbrance or restriction which by its terms permits payments to the Company to
the extent needed to pay dividends on any Dividend Payment Date or as otherwise
required hereunder.</p>
<p>(d) <u>Textron Share Liquidity Provisions</u>. The provisions of this Section
7(d) are solely for the benefit of Holders of Series&#160;A Redeemable
Preferred Stock that constitute Textron Shares. In the event that either
(I)&#160;both (A)&#160;the Liquidity Condition is satisfied at any time
and (B)&#160;no Par Offer has been properly made on or before the First
Dividend Payment Date and all Textron Shares purchased pursuant thereto or
(II)&#160;both (A)&#160;the Existing Notes are repaid at or within 180
days of their final Stated Maturity and (B)&#160;no Par Offer has been
properly made on or before such repayment, the Series&#160;A Dividend Rate
applicable solely to Textron Shares will increase by 1.00% per annum for the
first dividend period commencing on the first day after the First Dividend
Payment Date and by an additional 0.50% per annum for each dividend period
thereafter; <i>provided</i> that (1)&#160;the Series&#160;A Dividend
Rate applicable to Textron Shares in effect at any time shall not exceed 20% per
annum and (2)&#160;the Series&#160;A Dividend Rate will return to the
Dividend Rate otherwise applicable under Section&#160;2(a) once a Par Offer
has been properly made and all Textron Shares purchased pursuant thereto. The
period during which the increased Series&#160;A Dividend Rate in respect of
Textron Shares shall be in effect under the immediately preceding sentence is
referred to herein as the &quot;Restricted Period.&quot; During the Restricted
Period, if any, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall not Incur any
Indebtedness (other than Permitted Restricted Period Debt or Indebtedness
Incurred for the purpose financing a Par Offer) unless the Consolidated Coverage
Ratio (or, if there has been an Asset Acquisition after the Issuance Date of the
Series&#160;A1 Preferred Stock, the Adjusted Consolidated Pro Forma Coverage
Ratio) after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is equal to or
greater than the ratios specified below for the four fiscal quarter periods

repay, retire or defease Existing Notes (other than at or within 180 days prior
to their final Stated Maturity) in an aggregate principal amount greater than
$25&#160;million, unless prior to or concurrently therewith a Par Offer
shall have been made. Notwithstanding the Company&#39;s obligations to pay
Liquidity Dividends as provided in this Section 7(d) to the Holders of Textron
Shares, the Company shall not be required to make a Par Offer unless
(i)&#160;all Existing Notes shall have ceased to be outstanding,
(ii)&#160;the Company shall have consummated a defeasance with respect to
the Existing Notes in accordance with the terms thereof or (iii)&#160;the
holders of Existing Notes shall have consented to the making of such Par Offer.</p>
<p>For so long as there are any issued and outstanding Textron Shares, within 60
days after an Asset Acquisition occurring following the Issuance Date of the
Series&#160;A1 Preferred Stock and prior to a Par Offer, the Company shall
deliver a certificate of its Chief Financial Officer to the Holders of Textron
Shares certifying that attached five full fiscal year &quot;stand alone&quot;
projections (the &quot;<b>Certified Projections</b>&quot;) of Consolidated Cash
Flow and Consolidated Interest Expense for the Persons or assets acquired
pursuant to such Asset Acquisition (assuming for the purposes of such
projections that such Persons or assets are the &quot;Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries&quot; and disregarding clause (viii) of the definition of
Consolidated Interest Expense) are (1)&#160;projections that are utilizing
consistent operating assumptions with any projections delivered to lenders to
the Company in connection with the particular Asset Acquisition (it being agreed
that the Certified Projections are &quot;stand alone&quot; projections and will
accordingly give no effect to any impact of combining or integrating the
acquired Person or assets with the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries) or
(2)&#160;in the absence of the projections referred to in the preceding
clause (1), the projections utilized by the Board of Directors of the Company
(or any duly authorized Committee thereof) in approving the particular Asset
Acquisition. Such Certified Projections may include a prospective reasonable
methodology for allocating the indicated Consolidated Cash Flow and Consolidated
Interest Expense across quarters for the entire period covered by the Certified
Projections.</p>
<p>The benefit of the provisions of this Section 7(d) are solely intended for
Textron and its Subsidiaries and shall terminate as to any shares of
Series&#160;A Redeemable Preferred Stock that are transferred or otherwise
disposed of to any other Person, regardless of their subsequent reacquisition by
Textron or any of its Subsidiaries.</p>
<p>In the event of any transfer of Textron Shares to a Person other than Textron
or its Subsidiaries (a &quot;<b>Non&#45;Textron Transferee</b>&quot;), if
immediately prior to such transfer there shall exist Total Liquidity Dividends
in Arrears with respect to such Textron Shares, then immediately following such
transfer such Total Liquidity Dividends in Arrears shall cease to exist with
respect to such transferred Textron Shares (the &quot;<b>Transferred Shares</b>&quot;)
and the Transferred Shares shall be for all purposes shares of Series A
Redeemable Preferred Stock not entitled to any of the benefits afforded to
Textron Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, but without limitation, the
Transferred Shares shall have a Liquidation Preference and be entitled to Total
Cash Dividends in Arrears, if any, as if such shares (or any predecessor shares)
had never been Textron Shares. As promptly as practicable following a written
notice of a transfer of Textron Shares to a Non&#45;Textron Transferee, the
Company shall issue to such Non&#45;Textron Transferee additional shares of
Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock identical to the Transferred Shares in all
respects (including, without limitation, as to Liquidation Preference, Total
Cash Dividends in Arrears, if any, and accrued regular dividends), with the
number of such newly issued shares being equal to (x) the Total Liquidity
Dividends in Arrears formerly applicable to the Transferred Shares, divided by
(y) the Liquidation Preference plus Total Cash Dividends in Arrears (inclusive
of Additional Dividends accruing from the most recent Dividend Payment Date)
plus accrued regular dividends from the most recent Dividend Payment Date in
respect of each share of newly issued Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock as of
its date of issuance. In lieu of any issuing any fractional shares of Series A
Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Company may deliver to a Non&#45;Textron
Transferee an amount in cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the amount set
forth in clause (y) of the preceding sentence. The Company may require
reasonable certifications and indemnities from Textron and/or any
Non&#45;Textron Transferee concerning the transfer of Textron Shares as a
condition to issuing additional shares of Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock
(or cash payments in respect of fractional shares) as contemplated by this
paragraph.</p>

Expense for such period directly attributable to the Indebtedness of such
Restricted Subsidiary to the extent the Company and the continuing Restricted

became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period shall have made any
Asset Disposition or Asset Acquisition that would have required an adjustment
pursuant to clause&#160;(3) or (4) above if made by the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary during such period, Consolidated Cash Flow and
Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated after giving <i>pro
forma</i><u> </u>effect thereto as if such Asset Disposition or Asset
Acquisition occurred on the first day of such period. For purposes of this
definition, whenever <i>pro forma</i><u> </u>effect is to be given to an Asset
Acquisition, the amount of income or earnings relating thereto and the amount of
Consolidated Interest Expense associated with any Indebtedness Incurred in
connection therewith, the <i>pro forma</i><u> </u>calculations shall be
determined in good faith by the Company. If any Indebtedness or Preferred Stock
bears a floating rate of interest or dividends and is being given <i>pro forma</i><u>
</u>effect, the interest expense on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if
the rate in effect on the date of determination had been the applicable rate for
the entire period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to
any such Indebtedness if such Interest Rate Agreement has a remaining term that
extends at least until the end of such period). <sup>a</p>
