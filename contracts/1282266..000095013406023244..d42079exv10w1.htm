 1.6 _Net Working Capital Calculation and Adjustment_.

As used herein, " _Net Working Capital_ " shall mean (A) the sum of all current assets (other than (i) unbilled receivables, (ii) intercompany accounts receivable and (iii) directories in process) of the Division, as well as any Holdings Financing Expenses that have been incurred or paid by or on behalf of WIN or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates prior to the Effective Time, other than any such Holdings Financing Expenses that will remain liabilities or obligations of Holdings or the Division Subsidiaries after the Effective Time, less (B) the sum of all current liabilities (other than (i) all affiliates payable, including dividends accrued, (ii) publishing rights, and (iii) other deferred revenue), including any WIN Transaction Expenses that will remain liabilities or obligations of Holdings or the Division Subsidiaries after the Effective Time, but excluding any Holdings Financing Expenses that will remain liabilities or obligations of Holdings or the Division Subsidiaries after the Effective Time), of the Division, in each case determined in all respects in accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with all accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. For the avoidance of doubt, Net Working Capital shall be calculated prior to the application of any purchase accounting adjustments. If the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net Working Capital, then Holdings shall pay to WIN an amount in cash at the Closing equal to such excess; or (B) if the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital, then WIN shall pay to Holdings an amount in cash at the Closing equal to such deficit. WIN shall also pay to Holdings an amount in cash at the Closing equal to the Estimated Division Indebtedness. 

   

 (b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Holdings shall cause to be prepared and delivered to WIN, with a copy to the WCAS Subs, a statement (the " _Statement_ ") setting forth (i) the Net Working Capital, as of the Effective Time (the " _Actual Net Working Capital_ ") and the amount by which the Actual Net Working Capital (A) exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital (any such excess amount, the " _Working Capital Excess Amount_ ") or (B) is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital (any such deficiency amount, 

     ##### 

  

    

the " _Working Capital Deficiency Amount_ "); and (ii) the Division
Indebtedness, as of the Effective Time (the " _Actual Division Indebtedness_
") and the amount by which the Actual Division Indebtedness (A) exceeds the
Estimated Division Indebtedness (any such excess amount, the " _WIN Division
Indebtedness Excess Amount_ ") or (B) are less than the Estimated Division
Indebtedness (any such deficiency amount, the " _WIN Division Indebtedness
Deficiency Amount_ "). Subject to Sections 1.6(c), (d) and (e) hereof, (i)
Holdings shall, and the WCAS Subs shall cause Holdings to, pay to WIN
the amount of any Working Capital Excess Amount and/or WIN Division
Indebtedness Deficiency Amount and (ii) WIN shall pay to Holdings the amount
of any Working Capital Deficiency Amount or any WIN Division Indebtedness
Excess Amount, in each case, as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.6. To the extent that netting the payments referenced in the
preceding sentence results in a net payment by Holdings to WIN, the amount of
such net payment shall be referred to herein as the " _Excess Amount_ " and,
to the extent that netting the payments referenced in the preceding sentence
results in a net payment by WIN to Holdings, the amount of such net payment
shall be referred to herein as the " _Deficiency Amount_." The Statement
shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP utilizing the accounting
principles, practices, methodologies and policies used in the preparation of
the Financial Statements. 

   

 (c) After receipt of the Statement, WIN shall have twenty (20) Business Days to review the Statement together with the workpapers used in its preparation. The Statement shall become final, conclusive and binding upon the parties on the twentieth Business Day following receipt thereof by WIN unless WIN gives written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Holdings prior to such date. Holdings shall, and the WCAS Subs shall cause Holdings to, give WIN and its representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours of Holdings, to all personnel, books and records of the Division as reasonably requested by WIN to assist it in its preparation of the Notice of Disagreement. Any Notice of Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any disagreement so asserted, (ii) WINs calculation of the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time, and (iii) WINs calculation of the amount of Division Indebtedness as of the Effective Time. In the event that WIN delivers a Notice of Disagreement to Holdings within the foregoing twenty (20) Business Day period, then the Statement shall become final, conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto on the date such parties resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to any matter properly included in the Notice of Disagreement pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures set forth herein or by mutual agreement of the parties. During the twenty (20) Business Days immediately following the receipt by Holdings of a Notice of Disagreement, the respective Chief Financial Officers of Holdings and WIN shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any issues properly included in a Notice of Disagreement. During such period, Holdings shall have full access to the work papers of WIN prepared in connection with WINs preparation of the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 20-Business Day period, at the request of WIN or Holdings, any and all matters which remain in dispute and which were included in the Notice of Disagreement shall be submitted to KPMG LLP (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for a binding resolution. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be paid one-half by WIN and one-half by Holdings and the WCAS Subs. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (d) The Accounting Firm shall determine and report in writing to WIN and Holdings, with a copy to the WCAS Subs, as to the resolution of all disputed matters submitted to the Accounting Firm and the effect of such determinations on the Statement within ten (10) Business Days after such submission or such longer period as the Accounting Firm may reasonably require, and such determinations shall be final, conclusive and binding as to WIN, Holdings and their respective Affiliates, including the WCAS Subs. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm, acting in the capacity of an expert and not as an arbitrator: (i) shall limit its review to matters specifically set forth in such Notice of Disagreement delivered pursuant to Section 1.6(c) as a disputed item (other than matters thereafter resolved by mutual written agreement of WIN and Holdings), (ii) shall further limit its review to whether the calculation of any such disputed item is mathematically accurate and has been prepared in accordance with GAAP utilizing the accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies used in preparation of the Financial Statements, and (iii) shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by any party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by any other party in the Statement or the Notice of Disagreement delivered pursuant to Section 1.6(c). WIN and Holdings shall, and the WCAS Subs shall cause Holdings to, each furnish to the Accounting Firm such workpapers and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues, and shall provide interviews and answer questions, as the Accounting Firm may reasonably request. 

   

 (e) At such time as the Statement becomes final, conclusive and binding upon WIN, Holdings and their respective Affiliates, including the WCAS Subs, in accordance with this Section 1.6, the Statement shall become the " _Conclusive Statement_ ". If the Conclusive Statement contains a Deficiency Amount, then WIN shall pay to Holdings an amount in cash equal to such Deficiency Amount. If the Conclusive Statement contains an Excess Amount, then Holdings shall, and the WCAS Subs shall cause Holdings to, pay to WIN an amount in cash equal to such Excess Amount. All payments to be made pursuant to this Section 1.6 shall be made on the second Business Day following the date on which the Statement becomes the Conclusive Statement pursuant to this Section 1.6. Any payment required to be made by WIN or Holdings pursuant to this Section 1.6 shall bear interest from the date such payment is finally determined pursuant to Section 1.6(c) or (e), as applicable, through the date of payment at the Interest Rate, and shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by the party entitled to receive such funds prior to the date when such payment is due. 

   

 (f) For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes (including deferred Tax assets and liabilities) shall not be included as assets or liabilities for purposes of determining Estimated Net Working Capital or Actual Net Working Capital. Liabilities, assets, pre-payments, refunds and credits with respect to Taxes shall be governed by and allocated solely in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement.

less than five (5) Business Days prior thereto, provided, however, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing shall not take place prior to

such terms as will enable WIN, upon receipt of the Holdings Exchange Debt, to

Holdings Exchange Debt in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence,
subject to the responsibilities of the WCAS Subs set forth in the second
sentence of this Section 2.6(a). The parties hereto further acknowledge and

contemplated by this clause (v), (vi) disclosing the Holdings Financing, as
required under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, in any registration
statement and any other filings to be made with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and (vii) taking all other actions reasonably necessary

Each party shall have the right to be provided a reasonable period in advance of submission, to review, and to approve, materials prepared by the other party, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Each party shall provide the other party with copies of all memoranda, ruling requests, correspondence or other submissions as filed with the IRS promptly following the filing thereof.

 2.8 _Termination of Forward Underwriting Commitment_. In the event that the IRS determines pursuant to, or in connection with its consideration of, one or more of the Private Letter Rulings requested from the IRS pursuant to Section 2.7 that the Forward Underwriting Commitment contemplated under the Commitment Letter is inconsistent with such Private Letter Ruling(s) or that the IRS will not be able to issue any or all of the Private Letter Rulings to the extent that the Forward Underwriting Commitment is in effect, then the WCAS Subs shall terminate, and the Parents shall cause the WCAS Subs to terminate, the Commitment Letter effective immediately, such that the Parties will proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the benefit of the Forward Underwriting Commitment. 

  

 2.9 _Repayment of Division Indebtedness_. Prior to or at the Effective Time, WIN shall repay, or cause to be repaid, or assume, or cause to be assumed, all Indebtedness of Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries other than the Holdings Exchange Debt and any other Indebtedness incurred by Holdings in order to enable Holdings to pay the Special Dividend.

 4.3 _Title to Exchanged WIN Shares_. At the Closing, each WCAS Sub will have good and valid title to its respective Exchanged WIN Shares, free and clear of all Liens, and upon delivery to WIN at the Closing and the Second Closing of certificates representing the Exchanged WIN Shares, duly endorsed by each WCAS Sub for transfer to WIN or accompanied by stock powers duly executed in blank, and upon receipt by the WCAS Subs of the Holdings Shares and any cash payment required to be made by WIN pursuant to Section 1.6(a) hereof,

 4.5 _Capitalization of Division_. The WCAS Subs will at the Closing have sufficient capital to fund any amounts required to be paid hereunder (including applicable expenses). Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of WIN set forth in Article III hereof, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereunder, (x) each of the WCAS Subs, Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries will be "solvent" as of the Effective Time and (y) the Present Fair Saleable Value of the respective assets of each of the WCAS Subs, Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries will, as of the Effective Time, exceed (i) the value of all respective "liabilities of each of the WCAS Subs, Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries, including contingent and other liabilities," as of the Effective Time, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable federal Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable respective liabilities of each of the WCAS Subs, Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries on their debts as of the Effective Time (including contingent liabilities known to the WCAS Subs) as such debts become absolute and matured.

The term " _Solvency_ " shall have a correlative meaning. For purposes of the definition of " _Solvent_ ", (A) " _debt_ " means liability on a "claim"; and (B) " _claim_ " means (i) any right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured or (ii) the right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment, whether or not such equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured. " _Present Fair Saleable_  

   ##### 

  

 

 _Value_ " means the amount that may be realized if the aggregate assets of
the WCAS Subs, Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries (including goodwill),
as applicable, are sold as an entirety with reasonable promptness in an arms
length transaction under present conditions for the sale of comparable
business enterprises.

The Parents and the WCAS Subs acknowledge that WIN has provided the Parents and the WCAS Subs with access to the properties, premises, contracts and records of Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries for this purpose. Except as and to the extent expressly set forth herein and subject to the limitations and restrictions contained herein, the Parents and the WCAS Subs (i) acknowledge that, except for those representations or warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, they shall not be entitled to rely on any representation or warranty, either express or implied, previously made by WIN or its agents, representatives, employees or Affiliates as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information provided or made available to the Parents or the WCAS Subs or their respective agents or representatives, and (ii) agree that none of WIN, Holdings nor the Division Subsidiaries or any of their respective agents, representatives, employees or Affiliates has or shall have any liability or responsibility whatsoever to the Parents or the WCAS Subs or any of their respective agents or representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or state securities Laws) based upon any information provided or made available, or statements made, to the Parents or the WCAS Subs or their respective agents or representatives prior to the date hereof, other than pursuant to this Agreement with regard to representations and warranties made herein.

  ##### 

  

    

WCAS Subs and its authorized employees, accountants, counsel, financing
sources and other representatives (such entities and representatives other
than the WCAS Subs being referred to as " _WCAS Sub Representatives_ ")
reasonable access during regular business hours to all offices, personnel,
facilities, books and records of WIN, Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries
as they may reasonably request, and shall furnish or cause to be furnished to
the WCAS Subs such financial and operating data and other information with
respect to the business and properties of the Division as the WCAS Subs may
from time to time reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , (i) that the
WCAS Subs and WCAS Sub Representatives shall take such action as is deemed
necessary in the reasonable judgment of WIN to schedule such access and
visits through only those representatives of WIN set forth in Section 5.2 of
the Disclosure Letter, and in such a way as to avoid unreasonably disrupting
the normal business of Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries, (ii) that
Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries shall not be required to take any
action which would constitute (based on the advice of counsel) a waiver of
the attorney-client or other privilege, (iii) that WIN, Holdings and the
Division Subsidiaries need not supply the WCAS Subs or WCAS Sub
Representatives with any information which, based on the advice of counsel,
Holdings or the Division Subsidiaries, they are under a legal obligation not
to supply and (iv) that WIN, Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries shall not
be required to supply WCAS Subs or WCAS Sub Representatives with any
information that does not relate primarily to the Division. 

   

 (b) The WCAS Subs shall hold and shall cause the WCAS Sub Representatives to hold any information which it or they receive in connection with the activities and transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements in strict confidence in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of September 19, 2006, between WIN and WCAS (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII hereof, but shall not apply to any information regarding Holdings or the Division Subsidiaries upon completion of the transaction contemplated hereby; _provided_ _that_ each WCAS Sub acknowledges that any and all other information provided to it by WIN or WINs representatives concerning WIN shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing Date. 

   

 5.3 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements at the earliest practicable date. 

  

 5.4 _Consents_. Without limiting the generality of Section 5.3 hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals of all third parties required under Material Contracts and Material IP Agreements (but without any payment of money by WIN, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates) and all material licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements prior to the Closing. Each of the Parties hereto shall make or cause to be made all filings and submissions under Laws applicable to it as may be required for the consummation of 

   ##### 

  

    

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.
Each WCAS Sub and WIN shall coordinate and cooperate with each other in
exchanging such information and assistance as any of the parties hereto may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Except for those
consents and approvals set forth in Section 7.1(d) of the Disclosure Letter or
Section 7.1(d) of this Agreement, the failure to obtain any consent or
approval pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall not result in a delay of the
Closing or be deemed to be a failure to satisfy any of the conditions set
forth in Section 7.1 of this Agreement. If any consent or approval required in
connection with the assignment or transfer of any contract or agreement
(including any such contract or agreement referred in Section 2.2(c)) is not
obtained, or would be ineffective, violate any applicable Law or would
adversely affect the rights of WIN or its Subsidiaries thereunder such that
the Division Subsidiaries would not in fact receive all rights under such
contract or agreement, WIN and the WCAS Subs shall cooperate in a mutually
agreeable arrangement under which the WCAS Subs (directly or indirectly
through the Division Subsidiaries) would obtain the benefits and assume
the obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, including sub-
contracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to the WCAS Subs or the Division
Subsidiaries, or under which WIN and its Subsidiaries would enforce for the
benefit of the WCAS Subs, with the WCAS Subs assuming WINs or such
Subsidiarys obligations, any and all rights of WIN and its Subsidiaries
against a third party thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that WIN or its
Subsidiaries shall not be materially and adversely affected as a result of
providing such benefits.

each case, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other
order in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of
preventing or materially delaying the Closing, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
nothing in this Section 5.5 shall require or be construed to require any
WCAS Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries to take any action, propose
or make any divestiture or other undertaking, or propose or enter into any
consent decree, except for those that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect following the Closing.

 (b) WIN shall promptly notify the WCAS Subs of, and furnish the WCAS Subs any information it may reasonably request with respect to, the occurrence, to the Knowledge of WIN, of any event or condition or the existence, to the Knowledge of WIN, of any fact that would cause any of the conditions to any WCAS Subs obligation to consummate the exchange of the Exchanged WIN Shares for the Holdings Shares not to be fulfilled.

 (a) On the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, WIN shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the WCAS Subs to the extent reasonably practicable all original agreements, documents, books, records and files (collectively, " _Records_ "), if any, in the possession of WIN relating primarily to Holdings, the Division and the Division Subsidiaries to the extent not then in the possession of Holdings or the Division Subsidiaries, subject to the following exceptions:

 (a) _Continuation of Employment; Compensation_. Effective as of, and for a period of one year following the Closing, each WCAS Sub shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including but not limited to Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries) to, continue the employment of Continuing Division Employees on terms and conditions with respect to salary, wages and bonus opportunities that are substantially similar to those terms and conditions in effect as of immediately prior to the Closing. Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, each WCAS Sub shall cause the Division Subsidiaries to provide (or cause to be provided) to Continuing Division Employees benefits (excluding for this purpose equity-based plans or arrangements, incentives, defined benefit pension plans, retiree welfare benefits and non-qualified deferred compensation plans) from time to time that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the benefits provided to Continuing Division Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time under the WIN Plans (other than any equity-based plans or arrangements, incentives, defined benefit pension plans, retiree welfare benefits and non-qualified deferred compensation plans). Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting any WCAS Sub and its Affiliates (including but not limited to, Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries) from terminating the employment of any Continuing Division Employee at any time following the Closing Date and for any or no reason. If any WCAS Sub or their Affiliates terminates, or causes any Division Subsidiary to terminate, the employment of any Continuing Division Employee at any time on or after the Closing Date, the WCAS Subs or their Affiliates shall be responsible for the severance costs, if any, of any such termination. For a period of one year following the Closing, the WCAS Subs and their Affiliates (including but not limited to Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries) shall pay severance benefits to the Continuing Division Employees no less favorable than the terms set forth in Section 6.1(a) of the Disclosure Letter. 

     ##### 

 

   

 (b) _Benefits_. To the extent that a Continuing Division Employee commences participation in an employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by any WCAS Sub or any Division Subsidiary (an " _Applicable WCAS Sub Plan_ ") following the Closing Date, each WCAS Sub shall, or shall cause the Division Subsidiaries and the Applicable WCAS Sub Plan to, (i) credit each Continuing Division Employees service with the Division Subsidiaries, or any predecessor employers to the Division Subsidiaries, to the extent credited under the analogous WIN Plan as of the Closing Date, as service with such WCAS Sub for all purposes under such Applicable WCAS Sub Plan, _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Continuing Division Employees be entitled to such service credit to the extent that it would result in duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service or benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan and except as otherwise provided in any employment agreement, (ii) cause any and all pre-existing condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods, active employment requirements and requirements to show evidence of good health under such Applicable WCAS Sub Plan, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions and waiting periods would have been waived or satisfied under the analogous WIN Plan in which such Continuing Division Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, to be waived in the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs with respect to such Continuing Division Employee and such individuals spouse and eligible dependents who become participants in such Applicable WCAS Sub Plan and (iii) give credit for or otherwise take into account under such Applicable WCAS Sub Plan the out-of-pocket expenses and annual expense limitation amounts paid by each Continuing Division Employee under the analogous WIN Plan for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs. 

   

 (c) _Benefit Plan Liabilities_. All WIN Plan liabilities and obligations accrued by WIN with respect to Continuing Division Employees prior to the Closing shall be the liability of and paid by WIN, and WIN shall assume, retain and be solely responsible for all other obligations and liabilities relating to or at any time arising under or in connection with any WIN Plan or any other "employee benefit plan" (as defined in section 3(3) of ERISA) or other benefit plan, program or arrangement of any kind at any time maintained, sponsored or contributed or required to be contributed to by WIN, Holdings, the Division Subsidiaries, or any ERISA Affiliate, or with respect to which WIN, Holdings, any Division Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has any current or potential liability or obligation.

    ##### 

  

  

 (e) _WIN Retirement Plans_. Following the Closing, those Continuing Division Employees who are, as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, participants in the Windstream Pension Plan, Windstream Profit Sharing Plan or Windstream 401(k) Plan, as amended from time to time (collectively, the " _WIN Retirement Plans_ "), shall be given credit for vesting purposes only under the WIN Retirement Plans for their service with the WCAS Subs and their Affiliates (including without limitation Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries). The WCAS Subs and WIN agree to cooperate following the Closing for purposes of effectuating the covenant set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. As of the Closing Date, all Continuing Division Employees shall cease all active participation under any WIN Retirement Plan in accordance with the applicable WIN Retirement Plan documents; _provided_ _that_ WIN shall as of the Closing Date make pro-rated matching and profit sharing contributions to the Windstream 401(k) Plan and Windstream Profit Sharing Plan on behalf of all Continuing Division Employees for the plan year or portion thereof ending on the Closing Date, disregarding for such purpose any end-of-year or other service requirement to receive such contributions.

 (g) _No Implication_. Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of any WCAS Sub, Holdings, any Division Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them in accordance with the terms of such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and applicable Law, (iii) is intended to confer upon any current or former employee any right to employment or continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement or (iv) is intended to confer upon any Person (including employees, retirees, or dependents or beneficiaries of employees or retirees) any other rights as a third-party beneficiary of this Section 6.1. 

   

 (h) _Additional Information_. Following the date of this Agreement, WIN shall provide Holdings and the WCAS Subs with such information and documentation as may be reasonably requested by Holdings or any WCAS Sub for purposes of effecting the provisions of this Section 6.1. 

    ##### 

  

  

 6.2 _Certain Agreements_. Prior to the Closing, the WCAS Subs and WIN shall cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts (but without any payment of money by WIN, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates) to negotiate with parties to the agreements listed, and in the manner set forth, in Section 6.2 of the Disclosure Letter to either (a) amend or otherwise modify such agreements in order to, at the Closing, include one or more of the Division Subsidiaries as a party to each such agreement and set forth the respective rights and obligations of each of WIN and all other parties thereto or (b) cause the parties to such agreement, other than WIN, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, to execute a new agreement with one or more of the Division Subsidiaries on terms substantially similar (to the extent practicable) to those applicable to WIN, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates prior to the Closing. Except for those consents and approvals set forth in Section 7.1(d) of the Disclosure Letter or Section 7.1(d) of this Agreement, the failure to obtain any amendment, modification or new agreement pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall not result in a delay of the Closing or be deemed to be a failure to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 of this Agreement. 

  

 6.3 _Workers  Compensation_. Prior to Closing, the WCAS Subs shall use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill the necessary requirements of each state in which the Division Subsidiaries operate with respect to workers compensation insurance, including posting surety bonds or purchasing insurance policies. Each WCAS Sub shall use its commercially reasonable efforts after the Closing to obtain a release of WIN from any and all obligations of the Company with respect to workers compensation insurance. 

  

 6.4 _Use of WIN s Name and Logo_. It is expressly agreed that, except as provided in the Publishing Agreement or any of the other Ancillary Agreements, the WCAS Subs are not purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining any right, title or interest in and to the name "Windstream" or any trade names, trademarks, Internet domain names, identifying logos or service marks related thereto or employing the word "Windstream" or any part or variation derivation of the foregoing or any confusingly similar trade name, trademark, Internet domain name, logo or service Mark (collectively, the " _WIN Trademarks and Logos_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that during the period from the Closing Date until 180 days after the Closing Date (the " _Wind-down Period_ "), each WCAS Sub, Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries shall be entitled to continue to use, and WIN hereby grants each WCAS Sub, Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries a license to use, the WIN Trademarks and Logos to the extent that such WIN Trademarks and Logos exist or are contained as of the Closing Date on any business cards, schedules, stationery, displays, signs, promotional materials, manuals, forms, computer software and other similar material used prior to the Closing Date in the operation of the Division. The nature and quality of all uses of the WIN Trademarks and Logos made by each WCAS Sub, Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries shall substantially conform to the quality standards employed by WIN as of the Closing Date set by WIN and communicated to each WCAS Sub, Holdings or the Division Subsidiaries either directly or indirectly. None of the WCAS Subs, Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries shall use the WIN Trademarks and Logos in any manner which might reasonably be expected to dilute, tarnish, disparage, or reflect adversely on WIN or the WIN Trademarks and Logos. Each WCAS Sub agrees that immediately upon termination of the Wind-down Period, except as provided in the Publishing Agreement or other Ancillary Agreements or otherwise agreed in writing by WIN, the WCAS Subs, Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries shall cease and desist from all further use of the WIN Trademarks and Logos and shall adopt new trade names, trademarks, Internet domain 

   ##### 

  

 

names, identifying logos and service marks related thereto Marks which are not
confusingly similar to the WINs Trademarks and Logos. Further, it is
expressly agreed that, the WCAS Subs are not purchasing, acquiring or
otherwise obtaining any right, title or interest in and to the name "Alltel"
or any name confusingly similar thereto or related name any derivation
thereof, or, except as provided in the Publishing Agreement or any of the
other Ancillary Agreements, any name under which either of the Division
Subsidiaries may have been operated prior to the consummation of the merger
of Alltel Holding Corp. with and into Valor Communications Group, Inc.,
including any trade names, trademarks, Internet domain names, identifying
logos or service marks related thereto or employing the word "Alltel" or any
such other name or any part or variation of the foregoing or any confusingly
similar trade name, trademark, Internet domain name, logo or service
mark. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.4 to the contrary, Buyer
shall cause Holdings and each of the Division Subsidiaries to, promptly
following the Closing Date, change its name to delete any reference to
"Windstream", "Alltel", "Valor" or any other WIN Trademarks and Logos (and to
file with the appropriate Governmental Entities any certificates or
instruments required to effect such name change). 

   

 6.5 _ALLTEL Non-Solicitation_. From and after the Closing Date, the WCAS Subs shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates (including Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries) to honor the non-solicitation obligations with respect to employees of ALLTEL Corporation and certain related entities pursuant to Section 8.8(b) of that certain Distribution Agreement, dated as of December 8, 2005, between ALLTEL Corporation and WIN or its Affiliate for the period specified therein, as if the WCAS Subs, Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries were parties thereto. 

  

 6.6 _Termination of WCAS Securityholders Agreement_. From and after the date hereof, until the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, each of the parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, forebear from exercising any rights pursuant to the WCAS Securityholders Agreement, including any right to cause WIN to register the Exchanged WIN Shares or to take any action in connection therewith. Effective as of the Effective Time, each of the parties to this Agreement hereby waives the applicability of any provision of the WCAS Securityholders Agreement that may be triggered in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstance shall any party to this Agreement have any rights under the WCAS Securityholders Agreement with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby after the Effective Time and each of the parties hereby agrees to forebear from exercising such rights during the term of this Agreement. Each of the parties hereby covenants and agrees that, effective as of the Closing, the WCAS Securityholders Agreement shall terminate and be deemed cancelled in its entirety, and effective upon the termination and cancellation thereof, each of the parties unconditionally and forever releases and discharges each other party to the WCAS Securityholders Agreement from all obligations and liabilities arising thereunder. The foregoing termination of the WCAS Securityholders Agreement shall be of no force or effect unless and until the Closing shall have occurred and such WCAS Securityholders Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms (subject to the forbearance referenced above) unless and until such time as the Closing has occurred.

the result of a material breach of this Agreement by WIN; 

   

 (d) by the WCAS Subs if WIN shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in subsections 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) of this Agreement and (B) is incapable of being cured (or is not cured) by WIN within 30 calendar days following receipt of written notice of such breach or failure to perform by the WCAS Subs, _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of any such condition to be capable of satisfaction is not the result of a material breach of this Agreement by the WCAS Subs; 

   

 (e) by the WCAS Subs or WIN, if any court of competent jurisdiction or any Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable; or

 (a) the WCAS Subs shall return all documents, work papers and other materials (and all copies thereof) obtained from WIN, Holdings or the Division Subsidiaries relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements, whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof, to the party furnishing the same, and all confidential information received by the WCAS Subs with respect to the Division shall be treated in accordance with Section 5.2 hereof and the Confidentiality Agreement referred to in such Section; 

   

 (b) At the option of WIN or the WCAS Subs, all filings, applications and other submissions made pursuant to Sections 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 hereof shall, to the extent practicable, be withdrawn from the agency or other person to which made; 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in this Section 8.2, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force or effect, except for the obligations provided for in Sections 5.6, 8.2, and 10.1 through 10.11 hereof, the confidentiality provision contained in Section 5.2 hereof and the Confidentiality Agreement referred to in such Section, each of which shall survive any such termination of this Agreement without limitation; and 

   

 (d) Such termination shall not be deemed to release and shall not relieve any party hereto from any liability for any willful breach or violation by such party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, nor shall such termination impair the rights of any party to (i) compel specific performance by any the other party of its obligations under this Agreement or (ii) seek any other remedy under law or in equity. 

   

 8.3 _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented at any time but only by written agreement of the parties hereto. 

  

ARTICLE IX 

   

 _SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS; INDEMNIFICATION_   

  

 9.1 _Survival of Representations_. The representations and warranties in this Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of this Article IX and shall terminate on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date but shall not survive any termination of this Agreement prior to Closing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (a) the representations and warranties in Sections 3.2 (Title to Holdings Shares), 3.4 (Capitalization of Holdings) and 3.23 (Brokers) hereof shall survive indefinitely and (b) the representations and warranties in Section 3.13 (Employee Benefit Plans) shall survive the Closing for a period of three (3) years (the representations and warranties set forth in clause (a) above, the " _Fundamental Representations_ "). To the extent applicable, the parties intend to modify the statute of limitations and agree that no claims or causes of action may be brought against WIN or the WCAS Subs based upon, directly or indirectly, any of the representations, warranties or agreements contained in Articles III and IV after the applicable survival period or any termination of this Agreement; _provided_ _that_ if a claim is made prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period, then the claim shall survive until final resolution thereof. It is agreed that, in determining whether there has been a breach of any representation or warranty under this Agreement for purposes of this Article IX, the concepts of materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect, "in all material respects" and other similar qualifying language contained in the representations and warranties and certifications of or on behalf of the parties shall be given full effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in view of the limitation arising from the Basket, in the event that there has been a breach of any representation or warranty or certification by a party after giving effect to such qualifying language, then for purposes of determining whether the Basket has been exceeded with respect to such breach or breaches and the amount of any resulting Damages to be indemnified, the concept of materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect, "in all material respects" and other similar qualifying language contained in the representations and warranties and certifications of or on behalf of the applicable party shall be disregarded. 

    ##### 

  

   

 9.2 _WIN s Agreement to Indemnify_. From and after Closing, upon the terms and subject to conditions of this Article IX, WIN shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Parents, the WCAS Subs, their respective Affiliates (including Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries) and their respective officers, directors, and employees (the " _WCAS Sub Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against all demands, claims, actions or causes of action, assessments, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and costs of investigation or settlement (collectively, " _Damages_ "), asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or suffered or incurred by WCAS Sub Indemnified Parties by reason of or arising from (a) a breach of any representation or warranty of WIN contained in this Agreement; (b) a breach of any of WINs covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement; or (c) any liability or obligation at any time arising under or in connection with any WIN Plan; (d) any liability or obligation arising under or pursuant to section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA for any time period prior to the Effective Time; (e) any liability or obligation of WIN or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (other than Holdings and the Division Subsidiaries) unrelated to Holdings, the Division Subsidiaries or the Division; (f) any liability with respect to any Guaranties that are not released at Closing; or (g) any WIN Transaction Expenses to the extent such expenses are not actually reflected in the Net Working Capital adjustment in Section 1.6 (collectively, " _WCAS Sub Claims_ "). 

  

 9.3 _WIN s Limitation of Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the liability of WIN to indemnify WCAS Sub Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.2(a) hereof shall be limited to WCAS Sub Claims as to which a WCAS Sub Indemnified Party has given WIN written notice, setting forth therein in reasonable detail the basis for such WCAS Sub Claim, on or prior to the termination of such representation or warranty pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions for indemnification contained in Section 9.2(a) (other than as a result of the breach of the Fundamental Representations) shall be effective only after the aggregate amount of all such WCAS Sub Claims for which WIN is liable under this Agreement exceed an amount equal to Five Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($5,250,000) (the " _Basket_ "), and only to the extent of such excess. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall the aggregate amount of all WCAS Sub Claims for which WIN is liable pursuant to: (i) Section 9.2(a) (other than as a result of the breach of the Fundamental Representations), exceed an amount equal to Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) and (ii) Section 9.2(b) or (c), exceed an amount equal to the Transaction Amount less any amounts paid pursuant to Section 9.2(a). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, WIN shall have no indemnification obligations under Section 9.2 for any WCAS Sub Claim or series of related WCAS Sub Claims as to which the aggregate Damages are less than or equal to $50,000 and, further, such WCAS Sub Claims shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating the amount by which the WCAS Sub Claims exceed the Basket. 

  

 9.4 _WCAS Subs  Agreement to Indemnify_. From and after Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Article IX, the WCAS Subs, jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless WIN, its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, and employees (the " _WIN Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against all Damages 

   ##### 

  

 

asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or incurred by WIN Indemnified
Parties by reason of or arising from: (a) a breach of any representation or
warranty of any WCAS Sub contained in this Agreement; (b) a breach of any
of the WCAS Subs covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement; (c)
any liability or obligation of the Division Subsidiaries or the Division,
except for those matters which are subject of WINs indemnification of the
WCAS Subs pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement or Section 9.2 hereof; or (d)
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained
in any offering memorandum, registration statement, prospectus or preliminary
prospectus relating to the Holdings Financing, except to the extent that the
same are based upon information furnished by WIN, Holdings or the Division
Subsidiaries expressly for use therein; (collectively, " _WIN Claims_ "). 

   

 9.5 _WCAS Subs  Limitation of Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the liability of the WCAS Subs to indemnify WIN Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.4(a) hereof, against any Damages sustained by reason of any WIN Claim with respect to the breach of a representation or warranty (other than Sections 4.3, 4.5 and 4.8) shall be limited to WIN Claims as to which a WIN Indemnified Party has given the WCAS Subs written notice, setting forth therein in reasonable detail the basis for such WIN Claim, on or prior to the termination of such representation or warranty pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions for indemnification contained in Section 9.4(a) shall be effective only after the aggregate amount of all such WIN Claims for which the WCAS Subs are liable under this Agreement exceed the Basket, and only to the extent of such excess. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall the aggregate amount of all WIN Claims for which any WCAS Sub is liable pursuant to: (i) Section 9.4(a), exceed an amount equal to Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) and (ii) Section 9.4(b), exceed an amount equal to the Transaction Amount less any amounts paid pursuant to Section 9.4(a). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the WCAS Subs shall have no indemnification obligations under Section 9.4 for any WIN Claim or series of related WIN Claims as to which the aggregate Damages are less than or equal to $50,000 and, further, such WIN Claims shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating the amount by which the WIN Claims exceed the Basket. 

  

 9.6 _Procedures for Indemnification With Respect to Third-Party Claims_. Except as provided in the Tax Sharing Agreement, the obligations and liabilities of WIN and the WCAS Subs with respect to WCAS Sub Claims and WIN Claims, respectively, which arise or result from claims for Damages made by third parties (" _Third-Party Claims_ ") shall be subject to the following terms and conditions: 

  

 (a) The indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party prompt written notice of any such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure; and (B) the indemnifying party shall have the right, after it acknowledges in writing to the indemnified party its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party hereunder, to undertake the defense thereof by counsel chosen by it; _provided_ , that if the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense; 

      ##### 

  

      

 (b) Until the indemnifying party acknowledges in writing its obligation hereunder with respect to, and assumes the defense of, a Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party shall (upon further written notice to the indemnifying party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the indemnifying party subject to the right of the indemnifying party to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim at any time prior to settlement, compromise or final determination thereof (subject to subclause (B) of clause (i) above); and 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding any provision in this Article IX to the contrary, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), the indemnifying party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto, except in the case of any settlement that (A) includes as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the indemnified party of a written release from all liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim or (B) provides solely for monetary relief and does not otherwise involve or purport to bind or limit the indemnified party. In addition, if the indemnifying party shall have assumed the defense of the Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto, without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), and the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any such admission, settlement, compromise, discharge or consent to judgment made by an indemnified party without such prior written consent of the indemnifying party. 

   

 9.7 _Other Claims_. In the event any indemnified party should have a claim against any indemnifying party under Section 9.2 or 9.4 hereof that does not involve a Third-Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall, as promptly as practicable after discovery of such claim, deliver written notice of such claim to the indemnifying party. The failure by any indemnified party so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to such indemnified party under Section 9.2 or 9.4 hereof, except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced by such failure. If the indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified party within thirty (30) Business Days following its receipt of such notice that the indemnifying party disputes its liability to the indemnified party under Section 9.2 or 9.4 hereof, such claim specified by the indemnified party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying party under Section 9.2 or 9.4 hereof and the indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such liability to the indemnified party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined. If the indemnifying party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, as provided above, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation pursuant to Section 10.10 hereof. 

     ##### 

  

  

 9.8 _Sole Remedy_. 

  

 (a) The WCAS Subs and WIN acknowledge and agree that, if the Closing occurs, their sole and exclusive remedy (other than for fraud or intentional misrepresentation) following the Closing with respect to any and all claims, including WCAS Sub Claims and WIN Claims (whether Third-Party Claims or otherwise), relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the provisions set forth in the Tax Sharing Agreement and this Article IX; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall prevent an indemnified party from pursuing remedies as may be available to such party under applicable Law in the event of an indemnifying partys failure to comply with its indemnification obligations hereunder. 

   

 (b) The indemnifying party shall be subrogated to the rights of the indemnified party (to the extent permitted by the terms of such insurance agreements) in respect of any insurance relating to the Damages to the extent of any indemnification payments made hereunder. The WCAS Subs and WIN shall be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the amount of any Damages for which such party is entitled to seek indemnification hereunder. Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. 

   

 (c) Each WCAS Sub and WIN agree to treat (and cause their Affiliates to treat) any indemnification payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the consideration to be transferred between WIN and Holdings in connection with the Contribution. Any indemnification obligation under this Agreement shall be net of (i) any Tax Benefit actually realized by the indemnified party or its Affiliates, and (ii) any insurance proceeds or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by the indemnified party or its Affiliates from any third party with respect thereto, net of any expenses related to the recovery of such proceeds and the cost of any insurance premiums. The indemnified party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain full recovery under all insurance policies covering any indemnification obligation to the same extent as they would if such indemnification obligation were not subject to indemnification under this Agreement. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is received by any indemnified party with respect to any indemnification obligation for which any such Person has been indemnified under this Agreement, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the indemnifying party. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 9.2 to the contrary, for purposes of this Agreement, "Damages" shall not include damages incurred directly or indirectly as a result of lost profits or any damages that are special, consequential or punitive in nature, regardless of whether such damages are permissible by applicable Law. 

       ##### 

  

     

 9.9 _Exclusivity of Tax Sharing Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Tax Sharing Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to indemnification for Tax matters covered therein. Any conflict between the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement and any provision of this Agreement, or any provision of any other agreement, shall be resolved in favor of the Tax Sharing Agreement, unless such other provision expressly provides that it shall be given priority over the Tax Sharing Agreement.
