use their commercially reasonable efforts (but without any payment of money by WIN, its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates) to negotiate with parties to the agreements listed, and in the manner
set forth, in Section&nbsp;6.2 of the Disclosure Letter to either (a)&nbsp;amend or otherwise modify such
agreements in order to, at the Closing, include one or more of the Division Subsidiaries as a party

indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to
such indemnified party under Section&nbsp;9.2 or 9.4 hereof, except to the extent that the indemnifying
party demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced by such failure. If the indemnifying
party does not notify the indemnified party within thirty (30)&nbsp;Business Days following its receipt
of such notice that the indemnifying party disputes its liability to the indemnified party under
Section&nbsp;9.2 or 9.4 hereof, such claim specified by the indemnified party in such notice shall be
conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying party under Section&nbsp;9.2 or 9.4 hereof and the
indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such liability to the indemnified party on demand or, in
the case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on
such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined.
If the indemnifying party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, as
provided above, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute
shall be resolved by litigation pursuant to Section&nbsp;10.10 hereof.
