Section 2.8  _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the stockholders of any of the foregoing:

  



  

(a)   _Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock,
par value $0.001, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b)   _Company Capital Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.10_,
_Section 2.11_, _Section 2.12_ and  _Section 3.2_ and _Article 10_, each
share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be canceled, extinguished and automatically
converted into the right to receive the Common Per Share Cash Amount and the
Common Per Share Stock Amount.

  



  

(c)   _Excluded Shares_. Each share of Capital Stock held by
the Company in the Company's treasury, by the Company's Subsidiaries or by
Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, "
_Excluded Shares_ ") shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(d)   _Escrow Amount_. Notwithstanding any terms of _Article 2_
or _Article 3_ to the contrary, Parent shall withhold the Escrow Amount from
that portion of the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this _Section
2.8_,  _Section 2.9_ and _Section 2.10_ at the Closing, in accordance with
the Pro Rata Shares of the Sellers, for deposit into the Escrow Account.
Amounts payable to holders of Capital Stock as a result of the Merger as
provided in this _Section 2.8_ shall be estimated and paid as, when and to
the extent provided in this _Article 2_ and _Article 3_. Such amounts shall
be subject to reduction to reflect the funding of the Escrow Account (and,
potentially, the release of Escrow Funds), and any applicable Tax withholding
amount.

  



  

(e)   _Unaccredited Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that Parent reasonably believes
that one or more Stockholders are not Accredited Stockholders (any such
Stockholder, an " _Unaccredited Stockholder_ "), Parent may elect to pay the
Common Per Share Stock Amount with respect to such Unaccredited Stockholder
solely in cash to such Unaccredited Stockholder. Any such election by Parent
to pay cash (instead of the Common Per Share Stock Amount) to an
Unaccredited Stockholder shall not change the overall aggregate amount of the
Common Per Share Cash Amount, the Common Per Share Stock Amount, the Cash
Consideration or the Stock Consideration as provided in _Article 2_ or
_Article 3_, but shall result in the appropriate proportionate reduction of
the Estimated Cash Price Per Share and the appropriate proportionate increase
in the Common Per Share Stock Amount being paid to the Accredited
Stockholders and Accredited Optionholders so that the total amount of the
Common Per Share Cash Amount and the Common Per Share Stock Amount paid to all
Stockholders and Accredited Optionholders and RSU Holders in the aggregate
does not exceed the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration after
reduction for the Option Settlement Payments.

  



  

(f)   _Certain Adjustments_. If between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different
class, by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock dividend,
subdivision, merger, consolidation, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the Stock
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,
subdivision, merger, consolidation, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, exchange or similar transaction.

Section 2.9  _Treatment of Company Options and RSUs_.

  



  

(a)  Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then
outstanding option to purchase Common Stock under the Company Stock
Option Plans (collectively, the " _Company Options_ ") shall become fully
vested thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date (with such vesting subject
to the Closing) and shall terminate and be canceled by the Company and, in the
case of Eligible Options, shall automatically be converted into the right to
receive (i) (1) for holders of Eligible Options who are not
Accredited Optionholders, an amount of cash (without interest and subject to
any applicable Tax withholding) equal to the product of (A) the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Eligible
Option _multiplied_ by (B) an amount equal to the Estimated Price Per Share
minus the exercise price required to be paid by such holder in order to
acquire one share of Common Stock pursuant to such Eligible Option and (2)
for Accredited Optionholders, an amount (without interest and subject to any
applicable Tax withholding) equal to the product of (A) the aggregate number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Eligible Option
_multiplied_ by (B) the excess of an amount equal to the sum of the Estimated
Cash Price Per Share and Common Per Share Stock Amount _minus_ the exercise
price required to be paid by such holder in order to acquire one share of
Common Stock pursuant to such Eligible Option (with such exercise price to
reduce the amount of the Estimated Cash Price Per Share and Common Per
Share Stock Amount payable in respect of such Eligible Options ratably so
that Accredited Optionholders receive the same proportion of cash and Parent
Common Stock as Accredited Stockholders, after giving effect to _Section
2.8(e)_ ); and (ii) a Pro Rata Share of any additional cash amounts (without
interest and subject to any applicable Tax withholding) from time to time, and
solely to the extent, payable to the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement,
including pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)(ii)(D)_, _Section 10.2(b)_, 
_Section 10.8(b)_ and _Section 11.2_ (collectively, the " _Other Seller
Payments_ "). The amounts payable to holders of Eligible Options who are not
Accredited Investors as described in the preceding clause (i)(1) are
referred to herein as " _Option Settlement Payments_." Company Options that
are not Eligible Options shall be canceled at the Closing, the holders of
such Company Options shall not be entitled to receive any payments or
consideration whatsoever with respect to such Company Options as a result of
the Merger or the cancellation of such Company Options and the Company shall
have no further obligation with respect to such Company Options. Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each RSU shall become fully vested and shall
terminate and be canceled by the Company and shall automatically be converted
into the right to receive (iii) an amount (without interest and subject to
any applicable Tax withholding) equal to the product of (X) the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock issuable with respect to the RSU multiplied
by (Y) an amount equal to the sum of the Estimated Cash Price Per Share and
the Common Per Share Stock Amount; and (iv) a Pro Rata Share of any Other
Seller Payments (without interest and subject to any applicable Tax
withholding) from time to time, and solely to the extent, payable to the
Sellers pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  The Surviving Corporation shall pay all amounts owing to a
holder of Eligible Options and RSUs pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)_ (without
interest and net of any applicable withholding) when specified in this
Agreement by check, direct deposit or wire transfer of immediately available
funds (and for Accredited Optionholders and RSU Holders, in shares of Parent
Common Stock) (including by payment through the Company's third party payroll
agent). Other amounts payable to holders of Eligible Options and
RSUs pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)_ shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation
at the same time as such amounts are required to be paid to, or on behalf of,
the Stockholders. All amounts payable to holders of Eligible Options and RSUs
pursuant to this  _Section 2.9_ shall be subject to and reduced by any
applicable Tax withholding. Parent and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek to establish an appropriate net
settlement mechanism so that Accredited Optionholders and RSU Holders may
satisfy applicable Tax withholding associated with payments to be made in
respect of Eligible Options and RSUs granted under the Company's 2012 Stock
Incentive Plan through a reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable in respect of such awards, provided that any liability for Tax
withholding resulting from the implementation of the net settlement
mechanism shall be treated as a consolidated current liability of the Company
for purposes of the calculation of Closing Working Capital.

form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, of the holders thereof
with respect to such cancellation. The Company Stock Option Plans shall be
terminated as of the Effective Time.

amount of Closing Indebtedness, (iii) _less_ the amount of Seller Expenses,
(iv) _plus_  the amount, if any, by which Closing Working Capital is greater

Working Capital is less than Target Working Capital and (vi) less the TRT
Earnout Amount (the amount represented by this clause (1), the " _Cash Merger
Consideration_ "); plus (2) the Stock Consideration. The Merger
Consideration shall be estimated and finally determined pursuant to _Section
2.10(b)_. The Merger Consideration shall be paid as and when described
herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and for
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the aggregate consideration paid or
payable in respect of all Common Stock, Eligible Options and RSUs exceed the
Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b)   _Determination of Cash Merger Consideration_. The Cash
Merger Consideration shall be estimated and finally determined as follows:

  



  

  (i)   _Closing Date Estimate_. No later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent a consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ "), including the Company's good faith estimates of the amounts of Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital and Seller Expenses, together with calculations of the Cash Merger Consideration (the " _Estimated Cash Merger Consideration_ ") and the Estimated Price Per Share based on such estimates (which Estimated Closing Statement shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent). The Estimated Closing Statement and all amounts, estimates, determinations and calculations contained therein shall be prepared and calculated in accordance with _Section 2.10(c)_.

  



  

  (ii)   _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

  



  

(A)  Parent shall cause to be prepared and, as soon as practical,
but in no event later than 75 days after the Closing Date, shall cause to be
delivered to the Representative, a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ")
containing the actual amounts of Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Working Capital and Seller Expenses, together with a calculation of the Cash
Merger Consideration based on such amounts. The Closing Statement and all
amounts, estimates, determinations and calculations contained therein shall
be prepared and calculated in accordance with _Section 2.10(c)_. Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its auditors to, make
available to the Representative and its auditors all records and work
papers used in preparing the Closing Statement.

  



  

   

-21- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(B)  If the Representative disagrees in whole or in part with the
Closing Statement, then, within 30 days after its receipt of the Closing
Statement, the Representative shall notify Parent of such disagreement in
writing (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ "), setting forth in reasonable
detail the particulars of any such disagreement. Any Notice of Disagreement
shall include a copy of Parent's Closing Statement marked to indicate the
specific line items of the Closing Statement that are in dispute (the "
_Disputed Line Items_ ") and shall be accompanied by the Representative's
calculation of each of the Disputed Line Items and the Representative's
revised Closing Statement setting forth its determination of the Estimated
Cash Merger Consideration and any component thereof. All items that are not
Disputed Line Items shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes
hereunder unless the resolution of a Disputed Line Item affects an undisputed
item, in which case such undisputed item shall remain open and be considered
a Disputed Line Item to the extent of such corresponding effect. In the event
that the Representative does not provide a Notice of Disagreement within such
30-day period, the Representative shall be deemed to have accepted in full the
Closing Statement as prepared by Parent, and such Closing Statement shall
become final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder as of 5:00
p.m. New York time on such 30th day. In the event any Notice of Disagreement
is properly and timely provided, Parent and the Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts for a period of 30 days (or such longer period
as they may mutually agree) to resolve any Disputed Line Items. During such
30-day period, Parent and the Representative shall cooperate with each
other and shall have reasonable access to the books and records, working
papers, schedules and calculations of the other used in the preparation of
the Closing Statement and the Notice of Disagreement and the determination of
the Cash Merger Consideration and Disputed Line Items and the officers and
other employees of the other Party, in each case, to the extent reasonably
necessary or appropriate in connection with the resolution of the Disputed
Line Items. All Disputed Line Items agreed to during such 30-day period shall
be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties and not subject to further
appeal. If, at the end of such period, Parent and the Representative are
unable to resolve all such Disputed Line Items, then any such remaining
Disputed Line Items shall be referred to a nationally recognized independent
accounting firm mutually and reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Representative (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). Parent and the Representative
will enter into reasonable and customary arrangements for the services to be
rendered by the Accounting Firm under this _Section 2.10(b)(ii)(B)_, such
services to be provided in the Accounting Firm's capacity as an accounting
expert and not an arbitrator. The Accounting Firm shall be directed
to determine as promptly as practicable whether the Merger Consideration as
set forth in the Closing Statement requires adjustment. The Accounting Firm
shall be instructed that, in making such determination, it may not assign a
value greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party
or smaller than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Party, and
that the Accounting Firm is only to consider matters still in dispute between
Parent and the Representative. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Representative shall each furnish to the Accounting Firm such work papers and
other documents and information relating to the Disputed Line Items, and
shall provide interviews and answer questions, as such Accounting Firm may
reasonably request. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties and shall be based solely on the terms
of this Agreement (including _Section 2.10(a)_) and the written submissions
by Parent and the Representative and not by independent review.

  



  

(C)  The costs and expenses for the services of the Accounting
Firm shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), on the other hand, in inverse
relation to their success with respect to any disputes submitted to the
Accounting Firm for resolution. Subject to the foregoing sentence, each party
shall be responsible for its own fees and expenses incurred in connection
with this _Section 2.10(b)_.

(D)  After the Cash Merger Consideration has been finally
determined in accordance with this _Section 2.10(b)(ii)_ (the Cash Merger
Consideration as so determined, the " _Final Cash Merger Consideration_ "),
the following payments shall be made:

  



  

(1)  If the Final Cash Merger Consideration exceeds the
Estimated Cash Merger Consideration, then the Surviving Corporation shall pay
an amount in cash equal to such excess (but not more than an amount equal to
the amount of the Cap) to the Paying Agent or Surviving Corporation, as
applicable (for further distribution to the Sellers on a pro rata basis based
on their respective Pro Rata Shares in accordance with _Section 2.13_); or

  



  

(2)  If the Estimated Cash Merger Consideration exceeds the
Final Cash Merger Consideration (such excess, the " _Shortfall Amount_ "),
then Parent and the Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to the Surviving
Corporation, from the Escrow Account, an amount of cash and an amount of
Escrow Shares (valued at the Parent Market Price) (but not more than the
Escrow Amount), pro rata in amount to the Escrow Shares and Cash
Escrow Amount contributed to the Escrow Account) from the Escrow Account
equal to such Shortfall Amount.

  



  

(E)  Any amount payable pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)(ii)(D)_
shall be paid within 10 Business Days after the determination of the Final
Cash Merger Consideration by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account designated in writing by the recipient thereof.

  



  

(F)  Payments pursuant to this _Section 2.10(b)(ii)_ shall be
treated for all purposes as adjustments to the Cash Merger Consideration.

  



  

(c)   _Accounting Procedures_. The Estimated Closing Statement,
the Closing Statement and the determinations and calculations contained
therein shall be prepared and calculated on a consolidated basis for the
Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP and using the same
accounting principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods (with
consistent classifications, judgments, inclusions, exclusions and valuation
and estimation methodologies) used and applied by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in the preparation of the Latest Audited Balance Sheet, except
that such statements, calculations and determinations shall follow
the defined terms contained in this Agreement whether or not such terms are
consistent with GAAP.

  



  

Section 2.11   _Appraisal Rights_.

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, each share of Capital Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a
Stockholder who (i) has not voted in favor of this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing and (ii) who shall have otherwise perfected such
holder's appraisal rights in accordance with and as contemplated by Section
262 of the DGCL (each such Stockholder, an " _Appraisal Stockholder_ ", and
each share of Capital Stock held by such Appraisal Stockholder, an "
_Appraisal Share_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the amounts payable with respect to such Capital Stock under _Section

of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such Appraisal Stockholder
fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or loses such holder's right to
appraisal of and payment for such holder's shares under Section 262 of the

under this _Section 2.11_ (without interest) as and when such payments are
required to be made following surrender by such Stockholder of the

  (ii)  as soon as reasonably practicable after the Paying Agent receives any Other Seller Payment, an amount equal to such Stockholder's Pro Rata Share of such payment.

  



  

(b)  If any Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,

") of that fact from the holder claiming such Stock Certificate to be lost,
mislaid, stolen or destroyed, (ii) such customary contractual indemnity or
other undertaking as Parent may reasonably require and (iii) any other
documents necessary to evidence and effect the bona fide exchange
thereof, the Paying Agent shall issue to such holder the consideration into

Section 3.4  _Payments to Persons Other than Registered Holders_. If any
consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Stock Certificate or Eligible Option or RSU surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to such exchange that the
Person requesting such exchange shall deliver such Stock
Certificate, Eligible Option or RSU accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and shall pay to the Surviving Corporation
any transfer or other similar Taxes payable by the Surviving Corporation
required by reason of the payment of such consideration to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Stock Certificate, Eligible Option or RSU so
surrendered, or such Person shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

  



  

Section 3.5  _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and

deduct and withhold from payments made in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement such amounts as it is required to

and any other Applicable Law relating to Taxes. To the extent that amounts

the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent, or any of

good faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  



  

Section 3.7  _Return of Funds; Consideration Fund_.

  



  

(a)  If and to the extent any Seller fails to deliver a Letter
of Transmittal and the related Stock Certificate, Lost Certificate Affidavit
or Option and RSU Surrender Form to the Paying Agent prior to the six month
anniversary of the Closing Date, any funds received by the Paying Agent as
Merger Consideration or disbursements from the Escrow Account and payable to
such Seller in respect of such Seller's shares of Common Stock and Company
Options and RSUs, as applicable, shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation (and any
such cash may be commingled with the general funds of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be), free and clear of all claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto (other than the claims of a Seller and
its heirs, assigns and transferees hereunder) and shall be promptly delivered
to the Surviving Corporation by the Paying Agent, and such Seller shall look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of such amounts. Each Seller
who prior to such date delivers to the Paying Agent a duly completed and
executed Letter of Transmittal and surrenders the related Stock Certificate
or Lost Certificate Affidavit shall look only to the Paying Agent for
satisfaction of any claims related to the Merger Consideration and such other
amounts (except to the extent the Paying Agent has returned such funds to the
Surviving Corporation as contemplated above, in which case such Seller shall
only look to the Surviving Corporation as contemplated above). Any interest,
dividends or other income earned on the investment of cash held by the Paying
Agent, together with all Tax and other liabilities associated therewith,
shall be for the account of the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will
be liable to any Seller for any Merger Consideration or other amounts payable
to the Sellers hereunder if delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  



  

(b)  The Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Company; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that any such investments shall be (i) direct short-term obligations of, or
obligations fully guaranteed by the full faith and credit of, the United
States, (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation,
respectively, or (iii) a combination of the foregoing, and, in each case,
have maturities not exceeding three months. Earnings on the Consideration Fund
in excess of the amounts payable to the Sellers shall be the sole and
exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Company and shall be paid to
Parent or the Surviving Company as Parent directs. No investment of the
Consideration Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Company or the Paying
Agent from promptly making the payments required by _Article 2_ in accordance
with this _Article 3_, and following any losses from any such investment,
Parent shall promptly provide additional cash funds to the Paying Agent
for the benefit of the Sellers at the Effective Time in the amount of such
losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Consideration
Fund.

the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Company shall be closed as to
holders of Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and no
transfer of Capital Stock (or Eligible Options and Option Shares or RSUs and
RSU Shares) by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until
surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.2_,
each Stock Certificate theretofore representing shares of Capital Stock
(other than Excluded Shares) shall, from and after the Effective
Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive a portion of the
Merger Consideration as described herein and such additional amounts (if any)
described herein. Until a Joinder and other Option and RSU Surrender Forms
have been executed and delivered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.3_, each Eligible Option and
RSU shall, from and after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only
the right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration as described
herein and such additional amounts (if any) described herein. The Merger
Consideration and such additional amounts (if any) payable in accordance with
the terms of this _Article 3_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Capital Stock (other than any
Appraisal Shares) and Eligible Options and RSUs.

Section 4.4  _Financial Statements; Liabilities; Internal Controls;
Solvency_.

  



  

(a)  Attached to _Schedule 4.4(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules are true and complete copies of the following financial statements
(such financial statements, the " _Financial Statements_ "):

  



  

  (i)  the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 (the " _Latest Audited Balance Sheet_ ") and December 31, 2011, and the related audited consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for each fiscal year of the Company then ended; and

  



  

  (ii)  the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2013 (the " _Latest Balance Sheet_ "), and the related unaudited consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the nine-month period then ended.

  



  

(b)  Except as disclosed on _Schedule 4.4(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedules, the Financial Statements have been prepared from the
books and records of the Company and in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods covered thereby, except in the case
of the unaudited Financial Statements the absence of footnotes and normal
year-end adjustments. The Financial Statements fairly present, in all
material respects, (i) the financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the date thereof and (ii) the results of
operations, changes in stockholders' equity (in the case of the audited
Financial Statements) and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
the fiscal period covered thereby, in compliance with GAAP as in effect on
such date (subject, in the case of the unaudited Financial Statements, to the
absence of footnotes and changes that result from normal year-end
adjustments). The books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries are
true, correct and complete in all material respects. All of the accounts
receivable reflected in the Financial Statements represent bona
fide transactions of the Company and its Subsidiaries that arose in the
ordinary course of business. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have
received written notice on or prior to the date hereof from any customer or
partner that such customer or partner does not intend to pay any material
account receivable.

  



  

(c)  Except for matters reflected or reserved against in the
Latest Audited Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any liabilities of any nature that would be required under GAAP, as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, to be reflected on a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company (including the notes thereto), except liabilities
that (i) were incurred since the date of such balance sheet and prior to the
date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice and that in the aggregate are not material to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) are incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as such term is defined in Item
303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act). For purposes
of clarity, the representations and warranties in this _Section 4.4(c)_ shall
not be deemed to extend to the substance of any of the specific portions of
the representations and warranties qualified by "Knowledge of the Company" in
this _Article 4_, which substance is set forth exclusively in such specific
portions of the applicable representations and warranties.

(d)  The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and
maintained a system of internal control over financial reporting
appropriate for a privately-held company similar to the Company. Such
internal controls provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
the Company's financial reporting and the preparation of Company financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has not
identified, and the Company's independent accounting firm has not identified
to the Company, (i) any deficiencies, including significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses, in the design or operation of the internal controls of
the Company that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize or report
financial data; or (ii) any known fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company and its Subsidiaries' internal controls and the Company.

  



  

(e)  Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have, at any
time, (i) made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, (ii) filed,
or had filed against it, any bankruptcy petition or similar filing, (iii)
suffered the attachment or other judicial seizure of all or a substantial
portion of its assets, (iv) admitted in writing its inability to pay its debts
as they become due or (v) been convicted of, or pleaded guilty or no contest
to, any felony. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries are insolvent.

_Schedule 4.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules, assuming the truth and
accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set
forth in _Section 6.3_, no notices to, filings with, or authorizations,
consents or approvals of any Governmental Entity are necessary for the
execution, delivery or performance by the Company or its Subsidiaries of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Documents to which the Company or its Subsidiaries
are a party or the consummation by the Company or its Subsidiaries of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except for (i) compliance with
and filings under the HSR Act and (ii) the filing of the Certificate of
Merger. Neither the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Documents to which it is a party, nor the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, will (a) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of
the Company's Governing Documents, (b) except as set forth on _Schedule
4.5 _of the Company Disclosure Schedules, result in a violation or breach of,

terms, conditions or provisions of, or result in the payment of any
additional amounts or consideration under, any Material Contract or Permit,

Agreement or with respect to Permitted Liens, result in the creation of any

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of the intention

of business consistent with past practice that are not material
individually or in the aggregate, (ii) are incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. For purposes of clarity, the representations and warranties in this

the specific portions of the representations and warranties qualified by
"knowledge of Parent" in this _Article 6_, which substance is set forth

respective businesses as presently conducted and (ii) all such Permits are

effect that would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. During
the past two years, (x) no material violations have been recorded in respect
of any material Permit and (y) none of Parent nor its Subsidiaries has
received written notice relating to the revocation or modification of any
material Permits or alleging that it is not or may not be in material

threatened to revoke or limit any Permit, nor has any such Proceeding been
pending at any time during the prior two years. None of Parent or its
Subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets, or to Parent's
knowledge, any of Parent's or its Subsidiaries' directors, officers or
employees (solely in their capacities as such), are currently, nor have any
such Persons been at any time during the past two years, subject to any
material Orders. Parent and its Subsidiaries are, and for the two years have

Section 6.9  _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct
and complete copies of (i) the executed commitment letters from such Debt
Financing Sources dated on or about the date hereof together with the
executed fee letters referenced therein (except that the fee amounts, pricing
caps and other economic terms (none of which would adversely affect the
amount or availability of the debt financing) set forth therein, but not the
references to the subject of the flex terms, if any, have been redacted)
(such letters collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ ") from the
financial institutions identified therein (the " _Debt Financing Sources_ ")
to provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in
the amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (being collectively referred to as the " _Debt
Financing_ "). As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letters have not
been amended or modified, and the respective obligations and commitments
contained in such letters have not been withdrawn, terminated,
rescinded, amended or modified. Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in
accordance with the Debt Commitment Letters, the net proceeds contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letters, together with cash on hand at Parent, will in the
aggregate be sufficient for Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to, on
and after the date of the Closing, pay the aggregate Common Per Share Cash
Amount and satisfy the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this
Agreement. The Debt Commitment Letters are in full force and effect as of the
date hereof, and the Debt Commitment Letters constitute valid and binding
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, each
other party thereto, enforceable against such party in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date hereof,
no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would or would reasonably be expected to (1) constitute a default or breach
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other
party thereto, (2) to the knowledge of Parent, result in a failure of any
condition to the Debt Financing or (3) to the knowledge of Parent, otherwise
result in any portion of the Debt Financing being unavailable on the date of
the Closing. As of the date hereof, Parent does not have any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be
satisfied or that the Debt Financing will not be available to Parent or
Merger Sub in the full contemplated amount thereof on the date of the
Closing. There are no conditions precedent or contingencies to the obligations
of the parties under the Debt Commitment Letters (including pursuant to any
"flex" provisions or otherwise) to make the full amount of the Debt Financing
available to Parent on the terms therein except as expressly set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, there are no side letters or
other agreements, Contracts or arrangements to which Parent or any of its
Affiliates is a party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of
the full amount of the Debt Financing that could adversely affect the
availability of the Debt Financing other than as set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters.

Section 7.2  _Tax Matters_

  

 __.

  

(a)   _Indemnification by the Sellers_. The Sellers (severally
but not jointly based on each Seller's Pro Rata Share) shall be liable for,
pay (or caused to be paid) and indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser
Indemnitees from and against all Losses with respect to any:

  



  

  (i)  Taxes imposed by Applicable Law on or with respect to any Seller or the Representative;

  



  

  (ii)  Taxes imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries (or for which the Company or its Subsidiaries may otherwise be liable) with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period;

  



  

  (iii)  Taxes of any other Person imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries or for which the Company or its Subsidiaries otherwise may be liable arising as a result of (A) the Company or its Subsidiaries having been a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary, or similar group during any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (B) transferee or successor liability to the extent such liability results from or relates to any transaction undertaken by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, or (C) by Contract, to the extent such liability relates to a Contract entered into prior to the Closing Date, except to the extent such Taxes are allocable to the Post-Closing Tax Period with respect to any such Contract that remains in effect after the Closing in accordance with _Section 7.2(j)(i)_;

  



  

  (iv)  any breach or nonperformance of any representation or warranty in _Section 4.15_, or any covenant in _Section 7.1(a)(viii)_ or this _Section 7.2_ of the Company or its Subsidiaries, any Seller or the Representative relating to Taxes (A) in this Agreement or (B) in any certificate or other instrument or document delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement ( _provided_ that for the purposes of this clause (iv), qualifications as to material, materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect, Knowledge or other qualifiers of similar import contained in such representations and warranties shall not be given effect for determining whether a breach of such representations and warranties has occurred or for purposes of calculating any Losses);

  



  

   

-59- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

  (v)  Transaction Payroll Taxes; and

  



  

  (vi)  all transfer, excise, sales, use, value added, stamp, documentary, filing, recordation, real property transfer Taxes and other similar Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") that are imposed on or with respect to any of the Parties hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses for claims made with
respect to _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_ through _Section 7.2(a)(vi)_ in excess of an
amount equal to the then remaining portion of the Escrow Funds (with the
Stock Consideration being valued at the Current Parent Market Price). In
connection with any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section
7.2(a)(i)_, each Seller shall only be severally liable for his, her or its
Pro Rata Share of any Losses (individually or in the aggregate) resulting
from such claim, and no Seller shall be responsible for aggregate Losses in
excess of his, her or its Pro Rata Share of the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b)   _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this _Section 7.2_,
in the case of Taxes of or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries
that are imposed with respect to any Tax period beginning on or before the
Closing Date and ending after the end of the Closing Date (a " _Straddle
Period_ "), the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be:

  



  

  (i)  in the case of Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts, the amount of Tax determined on an interim closing of the books method as of (and including) the Closing Date ( _provided_ that depreciation and amortization deductions determined on an annual basis (other than with respect to property placed in service after the Closing) shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period in proportion to the number of days in each such period); and

  



  

  (ii)  in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the assets of the Company, or otherwise measured by the level of any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

  



  

(c)   _Payment of Tax Obligations_. Whenever the Sellers or the
Representative shall be required to pay Parent an amount pursuant to this
_Section 7.2_, such payments shall be made no later than five Business Days
after such payments are requested in writing by Parent and Parent provides
reasonable documentary evidence of the amount of such Taxes; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Purchaser Indemnitees shall only recover such Losses from
the Escrow Funds and shall not be entitled to recover such Losses in excess
of an amount equal to an the then-remaining portion of the Escrow Funds (with
the Stock Consideration being valued at the Current Parent Market Price). Any
payment pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ or _Article 10_ shall be reduced by
the amount of any Tax benefit actually realized in cash in connection with the
payment or incurrence of such Losses.

  



  

(d)   _Refunds and Credits_. Provided that the related Taxes
either (i) have been paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or
prior to the Closing Date, (ii) have been reflected as a liability in the
calculation of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_ or
(iii) have resulted in an indemnification payment to a Purchaser Indemnitee,
any refunds of Taxes or credits for overpayment of Taxes that are actually
received in cash, or actually reduce the cash Taxes required to be paid, by
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries
shall be for the account of the Sellers, and Parent will, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to, deliver and pay over to
the Representative for the benefit of the Sellers any such refund or the
amount of any such credit within 10 Business Days after receipt. All
other refunds and credits, including any refunds or credits reflected as
assets in the Closing Working Capital shall be for the account of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable.

(e)   _Transfer Taxes_. Any Transfer Taxes that are imposed by
Applicable Law on any Sellers shall be paid by Sellers in the time and manner
required by Applicable Law. The Sellers, the Representative and Parent will
cooperate (and cause their Subsidiaries and representatives to cooperate) to
timely prepare any Tax Return or other filings relating to Transfer Taxes,
including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or
imposition of any Transfer Taxes.

  



  

(f)   _Tax Returns_.

  



  

  (i)  The Sellers or the Representative shall cause the Company to file or cause to be filed in the time and manner required by Applicable Law all Tax Returns of or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries (i) that are due after the date hereof and on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii) that solely relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (regardless of when such Tax Return is due), and the Sellers or the Representative shall cause the Company to pay or cause to be paid in the time and manner required by Applicable Law all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in accordance with past practices unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. At least 15 days prior to filing any such Tax Return that is an income or other material Tax Return, the Sellers or the Representative shall cause the Company to submit a copy of such Tax Return to Parent for Parent's review, and shall consider in good faith Parent's reasonable comments. Subject to _Section 7.2(e)_, all other Tax Returns of or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries, shall be filed or caused to be filed by Parent. To the extent that any such Tax Return relates to Taxes for which the Sellers may be liable pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_, such Tax Returns shall be filed by Parent in the time and manner required by Applicable Law, and Parent shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns (subject to Parent's right to indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_). Until the Release Date (or such later time as all claims made by the Purchaser Indemnitees prior to the Release Date have been fully resolved), all such Tax Returns relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be prepared and filed in accordance with past practices unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. Until the Release Date (or such later time as all claims made by the Purchaser Indemnitees prior to the Release Date have been fully resolved), at least 15 days prior to filing any such Tax Return relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that is an income or other material Tax Return, Parent shall cause the Company to submit a copy of such Tax Return to Representative for Representative's review, and shall consider in good faith Representative's reasonable comments. Any items reflected on a Tax Return submitted for review to Parent or the Representative in accordance with this _Section 7.2(f)_ with respect to which they are unable to agree after negotiating in good faith for 10 Business Days shall be referred to the Accounting Firm for resolution as promptly as practicable. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes hereunder. If a Tax Return is required by Applicable Law to be filed or a payment made before the Accounting Firm has resolved the disputed items (taking into account valid extensions of time within which to file, which shall be sought to the extent necessary to permit the resolution of disputed items), the Tax Return shall be filed or payment made as determined by Parent, and shall be amended if necessary to reflect the determination of the Accounting Firm with respect to the disputed items. The costs of the Accounting Firm shall be borne in substantially the same manner as set forth in _Section 2.10(b)(ii)(C)_.

  (ii)  None of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries shall amend any previously filed Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent that such Tax Return relates to Taxes for which the Sellers are liable pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ without the prior written consent of the Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither the amount of Taxes reflected on any such amended Tax Return nor the consent of the Representative to the filing thereof shall be dispositive of the right of any Purchaser Indemnitee to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(g)   _Contests_.

  



  

  (i)  If a Governmental Entity asserts a claim for Taxes against the Company or its Subsidiaries and (ii) Sellers could be responsible for any portion of those Taxes under _Section 7.2(a)_ (any such claim, a " _Tax Claim_ "), then the Party first receiving notice of such Tax Claim shall promptly provide to Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Representative written notice specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the Governmental Entity in respect of such Tax Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of such party to give such prompt and detailed notice shall not relieve the other party of any of its obligations under this _Section 7.2_, except if and only to the extent that the other party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.

  



  

  (ii)  If, within 30 days after the Representative receives notice of a Tax Claim (whether from a Governmental Entity or pursuant to _Section 7.2(g)(i)_), which relates solely to Taxes for which Sellers would be responsible under _Section 7.2_, the Representative provides to Parent a written notice in which the Representative elects to contest, and to control the defense or prosecution of, such Tax Claim, then, subject to the provisions of this _Section 7.2(g)_, the Representative shall have the right to defend or prosecute and the right to control, at the Sellers' sole cost and expense, such Tax Claim by all appropriate proceedings. Parent shall be entitled to control the defense of all other Tax Claims of the Company and its Subsidiaries. For any Tax Claim that the Representative is entitled to control pursuant to this _Section 7.2(g)_ or that relates to a Tax for which the Sellers are responsible pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_, (i) the Party controlling the defense or prosecution of the Tax Claim (the " _Controlling Person_ ") shall defend or prosecute the Tax Claim diligently and in good faith; (ii) the Controlling Person shall not enter into any compromise or settlement of such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the other Parties (the " _Non-Controlling Person_ "), which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; (iii) the Controlling Person shall inform the Non-Controlling Person of all material developments and events relating to such Tax Claim (including providing to the Non-Controlling Person copies of relevant portions of all written materials relating to such Tax Claim); (iv) the Non-Controlling Person shall cooperate with the Controlling Person and its representatives in good faith in order to contest effectively such Tax Claim; and (v) the Non-Controlling Person or its authorized representative shall be entitled, at its own expense (or, in the case of the Representative, at the expense of the Sellers), to attend and participate in, all conferences, meetings and proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.

(h)   _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Subject to _Section
7.2(g)_, the Parties shall reasonably cooperate in connection with the filing
of any Tax Return, in any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect
to Taxes, and in allowing the Representative to review Tax Returns of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Tax Periods to determine or
verify the proper amounts payable as refunds hereunder ( _provided_ , that,
such Tax Returns will be limited to pro forma copies of such Tax Returns
that relate solely to the Company and its Subsidiaries). Such cooperation
shall include the reasonable retention and the provision of copies of records
and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any materials
provided hereunder. Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries and which relate to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (taking into account any extensions thereof), and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Entity. All of
such information provided pursuant to this _Section 7.2(h)_ shall be treated
as Confidential Information pursuant to the terms of, and as defined in, the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Parties further agree, upon request, to use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person or take any other
action as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed on any party hereto (including with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, at or before the
Closing, the Company shall deliver or make available to Parent true, correct
and complete copies of all Tax Returns of the Company filed with respect to
Tax periods ending on or after December 31, 2010.

  



  

(i)   _Tax Classification of Indemnification Payments_. The
Parties agree to treat any indemnification payments made pursuant to this
Agreement as an adjustment to the purchase price for all Tax purposes, to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law.

  



  

(j)   _Additional Tax Covenants_.

  



  

  (i)   _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Unless Parent otherwise requests in writing or such Contract or agreement is entered into in the ordinary course of business and is not primarily related to Taxes, any Tax sharing, Tax indemnity, Tax allocation or similar agreements (whether oral or written) between the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any other Person, on the other hand, shall be terminated prior to the Closing and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have no liability thereunder after the Closing.

  

  (ii)   _Powers of Attorney_. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall cause each power of attorney with respect to any Tax matters granted by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries to be terminated as of the day prior to the Closing Date unless Parent requests in writing that, or grants its written consent for, such power of attorney to remain in effect thereafter.

  



  

  (iii)   _Survival_. The representations and warranties in this Agreement relating to Taxes shall survive until the Release Date and the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement relating to any Tax matter shall survive indefinitely; provided, that, the obligations of the Sellers and the Representative to indemnify and hold harmless Parent for Taxes (and Losses attributable thereto) pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ shall not survive beyond the Release Date except for claims for indemnification asserted prior to the Release Date (which claims shall survive until final resolution thereof) and shall be limited, for the avoidance of doubt, to the then remaining portion of the Escrow Funds (with the Stock Consideration being valued at the Current Parent Market Price).

  



  

  (iv)   _Exclusivity_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all matters relating to Taxes shall be governed exclusively by the provisions of this _Section 7.2_ and _Section 2.8(d)_ , _Section 2.9(a)_ , _Section 2.9(b)_ , _Section 2.12(a)(i)_ , _Section 2.12(a)(ii)_ , _Section 3.4_ , _Section 3.5_ , _Section 3.7_ ,  _Section 4.15_ , _Section 7.1(a)(viii)_ , _Section 7.11_ , _Section 10.6(b)_ , _Section 10.6(c)_ and _Section 10.8(c)_ ; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to matters covered by _Section 4.10_ or _Section 7.7_  (relating to matters pertaining to employees).

(k)   _Tax Attributes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Sellers shall not have any indemnification obligations
to any Parent Indemnitee with respect to (i) the ability of Parent or any of
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to utilize any Tax
Attributes after the Closing, or any Losses incurred by reason of any
reduction in any of the foregoing with respect to their availability in Post-
Closing Tax Periods, whether such reduction occurs by reason of the carryback
or other utilization of such Tax Attribute by the Company, the filing of any
amended Tax Return for the Company, the redetermination of the amount of such
Tax Attribute by any taxing authority or otherwise; _provided_ , that nothing
in this _Section 7.2(k)_ shall affect the indemnification obligations of the
Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_; (ii) any Taxes attributable to any
action taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date
after the Closing outside of the ordinary course of business (including
making a Code Section 338(g) election or similar election); and (iii) any
Taxes attributable to any Tax period or portion of a period beginning after
the Closing for which the Sellers are not otherwise liable pursuant to
_Section 7.2(a)(iii)_ or _Section 7.2(a)(iv)_ as a result of a breach or
inaccuracy of the representations or warranties in _Section 4.15(j)_, 
_Section 4.15(k)_, _Section 4.15(l)_, _Section 4.15(t)_ _Section 4.15(r)_
or _Section 4.15(i)_ ; provided, that in the case of breaches of the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.15(i)_ , the Sellers
shall not have any indemnification obligations to any Parent Indemnitee with
respect to any Taxes attributable to any Tax period or portion of a period
beginning after the Closing following the one year anniversary of the Closing.

  



  

Section 7.3  _Access to Information_. From and after the date hereof until
the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (a) provide to
Parent and Merger Sub and their authorized representatives during normal
business hours reasonable access to all books, records, assets, properties
and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in a manner so as to not
interfere with the normal business operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries) and (b) furnish as promptly as practicable to Parent and Merger
Sub and their authorized representatives any information concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries that Parent may reasonably request. All of such
information shall be treated as Confidential Information. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, no such information shall be furnished to
the extent that it would require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
disclose information subject to attorney-client privilege or conflict with
any confidentiality obligations to which the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries is bound.

  



  

Section 7.4  _Efforts to Consummate_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each
of the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly
as practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
satisfaction, but not waiver, of the closing conditions set forth in _Article
8_). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to notify and to obtain consents of all Governmental
Entities as necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party shall make an appropriate filing
pursuant to the HSR Act and with any applicable other Governmental Entity for
which a competition filing is required in each case, with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, at a time mutually agreed by
Parent and the Company (and shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to make such filing not later than January 2, 2014) and thereafter
shall supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental
Entities any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act or Applicable Law governing a foreign
competition filing. Each of Parent and the Company shall, in their respective
filings pursuant to the HSR Act, request early termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) the Company and
Parent shall not extend any waiting period or comparable period under the HSR
Act or enter into any Contract with any Governmental Entity not to consummate

the other Parties, and (ii) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to take
all actions that are reasonably necessary or reasonably advisable or as may
be reasonably required by any Governmental Entity to consummate the

Parent shall deliver to each Accredited Stockholder the information that is

revenues, individually or in the aggregate); (d) for the sale, lease,
exchange, exclusive license, mortgage, pledge or transfer (including through
any arrangement having substantially the same economic effect as a sale of

consistent with past practice, but which in any event do not exceed 10% of the
Company's consolidated assets or revenues, individually or in the aggregate);

Section 7.6  _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business
Relations_. During the period from the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of (x) the Closing Date, (y) the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms or (z) such time, if any, as the Company reasonably
determines that any such meetings would have a detrimental effect on the
Company's business, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist Parent and Merger Sub, upon the reasonable request of Parent, in
arranging meetings and facilitating access for Parent and Merger Sub and its
representatives with customers and suppliers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; provided that the Company shall be present at all times during

(a)  If requested by Parent, the Company will adopt all
necessary resolutions to terminate each 401(k) Plan sponsored or
maintained by the Company, effective as of no later than one day prior to the
Closing Date (but such termination may be contingent upon the Closing).
Immediately prior to any such termination, the Company will make all necessary
payments to fund the contributions: (i) necessary or required to maintain the
tax-qualified status of the 401(k) Plan; (ii) for elective deferrals made
pursuant to the 401(k) Plan for the period prior to termination; and (iii)

(b)  For a period of one year following the Closing Date (or,
with respect to continuation of bonus opportunity, until the end of Parent's
fiscal year 2014), Parent agrees that each employee of the Company who
continues employment with Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (a " _Continuing Employee_ ")
shall be provided (except as mutually agreed as between the Parent and any
Continuing Employees) with (A) base salary and bonus opportunity (at current
payout level consistent with past practice over the past 24 months) not less
favorable than the base salary and bonus opportunity (at current payout level
consistent with past practice over the past 24 months) provided to each such
Continuing Employee (excluding any Continuing Employees with employment
agreements) immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) benefits either
(1) on similar terms as benefits are provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent or (2) that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate than
the benefits provided by the Company, in each case as of immediately prior to
the date of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement (i) shall require
Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries to continue to
employ any particular Continuing Employee following the Closing Date, or (ii)
shall be construed to prohibit Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any Employee Benefit Plan.

  



  

(c)  Parent shall ensure that, as of the Closing Date, each
Continuing Employee receives full credit (for all purposes,
including eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation entitlement and
severance benefits, but excluding benefit accrual), subject to any required
approval of the applicable insurance provider, which Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to procure, for service with the Company (or
predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides such past service
credit under its employee benefit plans) under each of the comparable
employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent, the Surviving Company
or the relevant Subsidiary, as applicable, in which such Continuing Employee
becomes a participant; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such service
recognition shall result in any duplication of benefits. With respect to each
health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary for the benefit of any Continuing
Employees that Continuing Employees become newly eligible to participate in
following the Closing Date, subject to any required approval of the applicable
insurance provider, if any, Parent shall (i) cause to be waived any
eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and
the application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan, and
(ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit under such plan for
all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under any similar Company
Employee Benefit Plan for the plan year that includes the Closing Date for
purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the applicable plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
relevant Subsidiary, as applicable, for the plan year in which the Closing
Date occurs.

  



  

(d)  Nothing contained herein, express or implied, (i) is
intended to confer upon any Continuing Employee any right to
continued employment for any period or continued receipt of any specific
employee benefit, (ii) shall constitute an amendment to or any
other modification of any Employee Benefit Plan, (iii) shall be construed to
prohibit Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries from amending or
terminating any Employee Benefit Plan or (iv) shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in favor of any Continuing Employees or others Persons.

Section 7.8  _Notification_. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall
give reasonably prompt written notice to the other Parties of the occurrence,
or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur would
be reasonably likely to cause (a) any representation or warranty of such
party that is contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect as if such representation and warranty were made at such
time and (b) such Party to fail to comply with or satisfy, in any
material respect, any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by such Person under this Agreement.

RELEASES, WAIVES, ACQUITS AND FOREVER DISCHARGES the Surviving Corporation,
the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent, Merger Sub, and each of their
respective Affiliates, together with each of their respective past and
present officers, directors, partners, members, trustees, employees,
stockholders, agents, attorneys and representatives (each, a " _Released
Party_ "), from any and all Losses, causes of action or suits in law or
equity, of whatever kind or nature that any Releasing Party ever had or may
now have against any Released Party to the extent related to the Company and
its Subsidiaries and that have accrued or arisen prior to the date of this
Agreement, including those based on any fact or circumstance arising from
such Seller's past or current ownership, as applicable, of any Capital Stock
or Company Options (including any claims relating to actual or alleged
breaches of fiduciary or other duties by the Company's directors, officers or
stockholders) or claims arising out of Affiliate Agreements, whether based on
contract or any Applicable Law in any jurisdiction, including under
California Civil Code Section 1542, which provides that:

  



  

"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know
or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release,
which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her
settlement with the debtor."

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 7.9_ shall or be
deemed to release any rights or obligations of any Releasing Party (a)
pursuant to and subject to the terms of this Agreement (including to receive
any Stock Consideration received by the Releasing Party); (b) pursuant to and
subject to the terms of any Ancillary Documents to which the Releasing Party
is a party; (c) pursuant to and subject to the terms of any indemnification
agreement between the Releasing Party and the Company (including
indemnification provided for under applicable Law) in effect on the date of
this Agreement or any insurance policy (including directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies) maintained by the Company or its successor for
the benefit of the Releasing Party; (d) pursuant to and subject to the terms
of any Employee Benefit Plan; (e) pursuant to and subject to the terms of the
Company's or its Subsidiaries' Governing Documents (to the extent not
terminated pursuant to _Section 7.12_); or (f) for accrued but unpaid
compensation and business-related expenses, each as incurred in the ordinary
course of business. The Company and the applicable Seller shall take the
actions set forth on _Schedule 7.9_ prior to the Closing.

of the Effective Time, and (ii) such other officers and directors of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent designates to the Company in writing at
least 10 days prior to the Effective Time, with all such resignations to
become effective at the Effective Time, it being understood and agreed
that, for purposes of the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii), in the
case of any such officer, such resignation shall represent solely such
Person's resignation from his or her official officer capacity with the
Company or its applicable Subsidiary, and shall not otherwise affect such
Person's employment status with the Company or its Subsidiaries, and shall not
be deemed a breach or waiver by any such person of any rights under any
employment or similar agreement to which such Person is a party.

the Merger Consideration in the preparation and filing of any Tax Return or
Tax election relating to the Sellers or their Affiliates, any Confidential

protective order or other remedy with respect to such Confidential
Information.

  



  

(c)  From and after the date hereof, no press release or
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby will be issued by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, on the other hand, without the prior consent of
Parent or the Representative, as the case may be, which consent shall not be

Section 7.18   _Financing_.

  



  

(a)  Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Debt Financing described in the Debt Commitment Letters on the
terms and conditions described therein including using reasonable best efforts
(i) to maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters until the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) to negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letters
(collectively, the " _Debt Financing Agreements_ ") on the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters or, if available, on other
terms (to the extent they are less favorable to Parent) that are acceptable
to Parent and would not adversely affect (including with respect to timing,
taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) the ability
of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
herein, (iii) to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding in the
Debt Commitment Letters and Debt Financing Agreements (other than any
condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of the
Company's failure to comply with its obligations under _Section 7.18(b)_)
and to consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing, and (iv) to
enforce its rights (including through litigation) under or with respect to
the Debt Commitment Letters and the Debt Financing Agreements. Parent
and Merger Sub shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or
grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision under the Debt
Financing Agreements without the prior written consent of the Company to the
extent such amendments, modifications or waivers would reasonably be expected
to (A) reduce the aggregate amount of cash proceeds available from the Debt
Financing to fund the amounts required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub
under this Agreement below the amount of cash on hand at Parent and cash on
hand at the Company which, in the aggregate, is sufficient for Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation to, on and after the date of the Closing, pay the
aggregate Common Per Share Cash Amount, (B) impose new or additional
conditions or otherwise be reasonably likely to prevent or delay or impair
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or adversely impact the ability
of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights (including through litigation)
against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing
Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice (x) of any actual or alleged
breach or default by any party to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Debt
Financing Agreements, (y) of the receipt of any written notice or
other written communication from any Debt Financing Source with respect to
any actual or alleged breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or any Debt Financing Agreement or
any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letters or any Debt Financing
Agreements, or (z) if Parent and Merger Sub determine in good faith that they
will not be able to satisfy any of the obligations to, or otherwise be able
to obtain, some or any portion of the Debt Financing prior to the Termination
Date. Upon the occurrence of any circumstance referred to in clause (x), (y)
or (z) of the preceding sentence or if any portion of the Debt Financing
otherwise becomes unavailable, and such portion is reasonably required to fund
the aggregate Common Per Share Cash Amount and all fees, expenses and other
amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof
alternative financing from the same or alternative sources in an amount that,
when combined with the amount of cash on hand at Parent and cash on hand at
the Company, in the aggregate is sufficient for Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation to, on and after the date of the Closing, pay the aggregate
Common Per Share Cash Amount on terms and conditions not materially less
favorable, in the aggregate, to the Company or Parent than the terms set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letters (including the flex provisions thereof).
Any reference in this Agreement to (1) the "Debt Financing" shall include any
such alternative financing, (2) the "Debt Commitment Letters" shall include
the commitment letters and the corresponding fee letter with respect to any
such alternative financing, (3) the "Debt Financing Agreements" shall include
the definitive agreements with respect to any such alternative financing and
(4) the "Debt Financing Sources" shall include the financing institutions
contemplated to provide any such alternative financing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in
this _Section 7.18(a)_ shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable
best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require,
either Parent or Merger Sub to pay any fees or any interest rates applicable
to the Debt Financing in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter (including the flex provisions), or agree to any "market flex" term
less favorable to Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company than such
corresponding market flex term contained in or contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (in either case, whether to secure waiver of any conditions
contained therein or otherwise). Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing.

required by, or necessary to satisfy conditions precedent under, the Debt
Commitment Letters) and other customary documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent; (vii) facilitating the pledging of collateral for the
Debt Financing; (viii) requesting from the Company's existing lenders such
customary documents in connection with re-financings as requested by Parent in
connection with the Debt Financing and collateral arrangements, including

documentation and other information required by Governmental Entities with

obtaining all documents, affidavits, estoppels and signatures required in
connection with title insurance and other documentation and items relating to
the Debt Financing as reasonably requested by Parent; and (xi) cooperating
with Parent, and taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of
the Effective Time, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation

to the Effective Time, the Company and its Affiliates and their
representatives shall not have any responsibility for, or incur any liability
to any Person under, any Debt Financing in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any cooperation provided pursuant to this
_Section 7.18_ and that Parent and Merger Sub shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective representatives from and against any and all liabilities,

(c)  The Company hereby consents to the use of the Company's
name, trademarks and logos in connection with the Debt Financing in
substantially the same manner currently being used. In connection with any
Offering Document prepared by Parent and used to market any debt securities
or debt financing contemplated pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters prior
to the Closing, the Company will, upon request of Parent, use its reasonable
best efforts to periodically update any Required Information included in
such Offering Document so that Parent may ensure that such Required
Information, when taken as a whole, does not contain as of the time provided,
giving effect to any supplements, any untrue statement of material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained therein not materially misleading.

  



  

(d)  Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the
obtaining of the Debt Financing is not a condition to Closing and
that, subject to _Section 9.3_ and _Section 12.14_ the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement are not contingent in any respect
upon the funding of the amounts contemplated to be funded pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letters.

  



  

Section 7.19   _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to

Effective Time a waiver of the right to receive payments that could
constitute "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code and
regulations promulgated thereunder in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent,
from each Person whom the Company believes might otherwise receive, have
received or have the right or entitlement to receive any parachute payment
under Section 280G of the Code. The Company shall deliver each such parachute
payment waiver to Parent on or before the Closing Date. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the approval by such number of
shareholders of the Company as is required by the terms of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code so as to render the parachute payment provisions of
Section 280G of the Code inapplicable to any and all payments and/or
benefits provided pursuant to contracts or arrangements that, in the absence
of the executed parachute payment waivers by the affected Persons above,
might otherwise result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any
amount and/or the provision of any benefit that would not be deductible by
reason of Section 280G of the Code, with such stockholder approval to be
obtained in a manner which satisfies all applicable requirements of such
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder,
including Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such Treasury Regulations.

Section 9.3  _Parent Termination Fee_ 

  



  

(a)  In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_ as a result of the failure of the Debt
Financing to be funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letters when the
parties thereto were otherwise obligated to do so, then Parent shall pay to
the Company a termination fee of $25,000,000 in cash (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by the Company no later than two Business Days after the
date of such termination (it being understood that in no event shall Parent be
required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion). If
Parent becomes obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section 9.3_ under circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is
payable, then (i) the Parent Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for, and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise), of the Company, its Subsidiaries,
the Sellers, the Representative, the Stockholders or any of their respective
former, current or future general or limited partners, shareholders,
financing sources, managers, members, directors, officers, employees,
advisors and counsel or Affiliates (collectively, the " _Company Related
Parties_ ") against Parent, Merger Sub, the Debt Financing Sources or any of
their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, financing sources, managers, members, directors, officers,
employees, advisors, counsel or Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent
Related Parties_ ") for any and all Losses suffered or incurred by the
Company Related Parties in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letters (and the termination hereof and thereof), the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (and the abandonment or termination hereof
and thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and neither
the Company, the Company Related Parties nor any other Person shall be
entitled to bring or maintain any Proceeding against any Parent Related
Parties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letters, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(or the abandonment or termination hereof or thereof) or any matters forming
the basis for such termination under circumstances where the Parent
Termination Fee is payable and Parent pays the Parent Termination Fee to the
Company; and (ii) the Company Related Parties agree that the maximum
aggregate monetary liability of the Parent Related Parties, if any, shall be
limited to the amount of the Parent Termination Fee, and, subject to _Section
9.3(b)_, in no event shall any Company Related Party seek to recover, whether
at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, any monetary damages in
excess of the Parent Termination Fee.

(b)  The Parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, none of the
Parties would have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent fails
to timely pay the Parent Termination Fee under circumstances where it is
payable, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a
Proceeding that results in an award against the Parent for such fee, then
Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such Proceeding, together
with interest on the amount of the Parent Termination Fee from the date such
payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime
lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date
that such payment was required to be made.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company's rights set forth in this _Section 9.3_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies available to the Company and the Company Related
Parties against any Parent Related Parties for any Loss suffered as a result
of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to
perform hereunder or otherwise, in each case under circumstances where the
Parent Termination Fee is payable and paid; _provided_ that (1) under no
circumstances will the Company or the Company Related Parties be entitled to
monetary damages, reimbursement of expenses, indemnification or other payment
in excess of the amount of the Parent Termination Fee where the Parent
Termination Fee is payable and paid; and (2) while the Company may pursue
both a grant of specific performance in accordance with _Section 12.14_ and
the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under _Section 9.3(a)_, under no
circumstances shall the Company or the Company Related Parties be permitted
or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of Parent's and
Merger Sub's obligation to consummate the Merger and any money damages,
including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee.

import contained in such representations and warranties shall not be given
effect for determining whether a breach of such representations and
warranties has occurred or for purposes of calculating any Losses), (ii) any
breach by the Sellers or the Representative or, prior to Closing, the
Company, of any of their respective covenants or agreements contained herein
(other than those relating to Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by

of the consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of

respect of any Appraisal Shares; (iv) the failure of any item set forth in

Consideration. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall
have any liability with respect to the allocation and payment of proceeds to
the former holders of Common Stock and the former holders of Company Options
and RSUs resulting from any payments made to such former holders pursuant to
this Agreement. The Sellers and the Representative hereby covenant not to sue
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation for any Losses resulting from
their respective reliance on such directions, which includes reliance on the
Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule.

(b)  Subject to the other provisions of this Article 10, from
and after the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold each Seller and their
respective officers, directors, employees, partners, stockholders,
Affiliates, agents and representatives, and any successors or assigns of any
of the foregoing (each a " _Seller Indemnitee_ "), harmless from any Losses
actually incurred or sustained that arise out of or result, directly or
indirectly, from: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by
Parent or Merger Sub (A) contained in this Agreement or (B) in
any certificate or other instrument or document delivered to the Company or
the Representative pursuant to this Agreement ( _provided_  that for the
purposes of the foregoing clause (i), qualifications as to material,
materiality, Parent Material Adverse Effect or other qualifiers of similar
import contained in such representations and warranties shall not be given
effect for determining whether a breach of such representations and
warranties has occurred or for purposes of calculating any Losses); and (ii)
any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of its covenants or agreements
contained herein.

  



  

(c)  The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless pursuant to
this _Section 10.2_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby for the applicable periods set forth in _Section 10.1_,
except for claims for indemnification asserted prior to the end of an
applicable period (which claims shall survive until final resolution
thereof). It is the intention of the Parties that, other than in the case of
fraud, all applicable statutes of limitations or other claims periods with
respect to claims for Losses be shortened to the applicable claims periods and
survival periods expressly set forth herein.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the
event that any Seller fails to execute this Agreement or a Joinder prior to
the final resolution of any Loss, then each Seller that has executed this
Agreement or a Joinder by such time shall assume its Pro Rata Share of all
such non-executing Sellers' indemnification obligations that would be covered
by the Escrow Amount (and, with respect to claims limited by _Section
10.5(a)(iii)_ , the Stock Consideration until the 180th Day) pursuant to this
_Section 10.2_. Solely for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence,
both the numerator and the denominator of the definition of "Pro Rata Share"
shall be interpreted so as to give no effect to the number of shares of
Common Stock or Option Shares or RSU Shares held by each Seller that fails to
execute this Agreement or a Joinder prior to the final resolution of any
Loss, determined at the time such Losses are paid by the Seller Indemnitees.

Section 10.3   _Inter-Party Claims_. In order for a Purchaser
Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be
entitled to any indemnification pursuant to this _Article 10_, the
Indemnified Party shall provide the other Party or Parties from whom such
indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") a Notice of Claim
promptly after occurrence of the event giving rise to such Indemnified Party's
claim for indemnification;  _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give
such Notice of Claim shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder, except to the extent (and only to the extent) the Indemnifying
Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure or the indemnification obligations are materially increased as a
result of such failure. The Indemnified Party and its Subsidiaries shall (and
shall cause their representatives to) provide the Indemnifying Party, upon
request, reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable
advance notice to the books, records and assets of the Indemnified Party and
its Subsidiaries that evidence or support such claim or the act, omission or
occurrence giving rise to such claim and the right, upon reasonable advance
notice during normal business hours, to interview any executive officer or
senior employee of the Indemnified Party with knowledge of the factual
circumstances underlying such claim at a mutually convenient time if
reasonably necessary for the Indemnifying Party to evaluate such claim. If
the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect to any such
claim, then the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with _Article 12_.

  



  

Section 10.4   _Third Party Claims_.

  



  

(a)  If a claim, action, suit or proceeding (other than a
claim, action, suit or proceeding with respect to Taxes, which shall be
governed exclusively by _Section 7.2_), by a Person who is not a party hereto
or an Affiliate thereof (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") is made against an
Indemnified Party, and if such Person intends to seek indemnity with respect
thereto under this _Section 10.4(a)_, such Indemnified Party shall within
fifteen days give a Notice of Claim to the Party obligated to indemnify such
Indemnified Party (such notified party, the " _Responsible Party_ ");
_provided_ that the failure to give such Notice of Claim shall not relieve
the Responsible Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent (and
only to the extent) that the Responsible Party shall have been actually and
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure or the indemnification
obligations are materially increased as a result of such failure. The
Responsible Party shall have 30 days after receipt of such Notice of Claim
to, if it so chooses, assume the conduct and control, at the expense of the
Responsible Party, of the settlement or defense of such Third Party Claim,
and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Responsible Party
in connection therewith; _provided_ , that the Responsible Party shall permit
the Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or defense through
counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party (the fees and expenses of such counsel
to be borne by the Indemnified Party). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (A)
in the good faith, reasonable opinion of Parent after consultation with
outside counsel, a Third Party Claim against a Purchaser Indemnitee (i)
involves an issue or matter which would reasonably be expected, if adversely
determined, to adversely affect such Purchaser Indemnitee other than as a
result of monetary damages or (ii) involves a claim that the Representative
could not control without there being a conflict of interest (as determined in
good faith after consultation with outside counsel) or (B) a Chosen Court,
upon petition by the Indemnified Party, determines that the Responsible Party
failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such Third Party Claim,
then in each case, Parent shall have the right to control the defense or
settlement of such Third Party Claim. If the Responsible Party assumes the
conduct of the defense of such Third Party Claim, so long as the Responsible
Party is reasonably contesting such Third Party Claim in good faith, then
the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle such Third Party Claim unless
the Indemnified Party waives any right to indemnity by the Responsible Party
for any and all Losses related to such Third Party Claim (unless the
Responsible Party shall have consented to such payment or settlement). If the
Responsible Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days after
the receipt of a Notice of Claim from the Indemnified Party hereunder that it
elects to undertake the defense of such Third Party Claim, then the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, and settle or compromise
(but any settlement or compromise effected without the consent of the
Responsible Party, not to be unreasonably withheld, shall not be conclusive as
to the amount of any Losses), such Third Party Claim but shall not thereby
waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. If the
Responsible Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, then the
Responsible Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement, compromise or
discharge of a Third Party Claim unless such settlement, compromise
or discharge by its terms (1) obligates the Responsible Party to pay the full
amount of Losses, if any, in connection with such Third Party Claim; (2) does
not impose any injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party; and (3) expressly and unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party
from all liabilities with respect to such Third Party Claim.

(b)  All of the Parties shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder and each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith and otherwise provide the access and
information contemplated by _Section 10.3_.

  



  

Section 10.5   _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_.

  



  

(a)  Other than with respect to Losses related to Taxes (which

rights of the Purchaser Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 10.2(a)_ are subject to the following limitations:

  



  

  (i)  the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses for claims made with respect to breaches of the Non-Fundamental Representations pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ until the total amount which the Purchaser Indemnitees would recover under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ exceeds $5,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover the aggregate amount of all such Losses in excess of the Deductible;

  



  

  (ii)  subject to Section 10.5(a)(iii), at any given time the Escrow Amount shall be the sole source of recovery with respect to Losses for claims made with respect to _Section 10.2(a)_, and in no event shall the Purchaser Indemnitees be entitled to recover more than the Escrow Amount with respect to such Losses; and

  



  

  (iii)  notwithstanding _Section 10.5(a)(ii)_ , until midnight New York time on the 180th day following the Closing (the " _180 th Day_"), the Escrow Amount and the Stock Consideration shall be the sole source of recovery with respect to Losses for claims made with respect to breaches of the Fundamental Representations pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_  or for claims made pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(iv)_ or _Section 10.2(a)(v)_ , and in no event shall the Purchaser Indemnitees be entitled to recover more than the Escrow Amount plus the Stock Consideration (valued at the Current Parent Market Price) with respect to such Losses, and any claims made after the 180th Day for such Losses shall be subject to the limitations in _Section 10.5(a)(ii)_.

pursuant to the provisions of _Section 10.2(b)_ are subject to the following
limitations:

  



  

  (i)  the Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses for claims made with respect to breaches of the Non-Fundamental Representations pursuant to _Section 10.2(b)(i)_ until the total amount which the Purchaser Indemnitees would recover under _Section 10.2(b)(i)_ exceeds the Deductible, in which case the Seller Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover the aggregate amount of all such Losses in excess of the Deductible;

  



  

  (ii)  the Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses for claims made pursuant to _Section 10.2(b)_ in excess of an amount equal to the Cap; and in no event shall the Seller Indemnitees be entitled to recover more than the Cap with respect to Losses (provided that the foregoing shall not limit Parent's obligations to pay the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.12(a)_ ).

  



  

Section 10.6   _Limitation on Consequential Damages, Etc.; Certain
Other Restrictions on Indemnification_.

  



  

(a)  No Party shall be liable for any punitive, special,
consequential, lost profits, diminution in value, incidental, indirect or
exemplary damages or Losses based thereon (other than those actually paid to a
third party as part of a Third Party Claim).

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, no Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee shall have any right
to indemnification under this _Article 10_ or _Section 7.2_ with respect to
any Losses to the extent that such Losses are duplicative of Losses that have
previously been recovered by such Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee
under  _Section 2.10(b)(ii)_, _Section 7.2_ or this _Article 10_.

  



  

(c)  The amount of any and all Losses for which indemnification
is provided under this _Article 10_ shall be determined net of (i) any
amounts actually recovered by the Purchaser Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees
under insurance policies or other collateral sources (such as contractual
indemnities of any Person which are contained outside of this Agreement) with
respect to such Losses, in each case, net of the present value of any
increases in premiums and net of any costs of collection,
deductibles, retroactive premium adjustment, reimbursement obligation or
other cost resulting from making any claim thereunder, and (ii) any Tax
benefits actually realized in cash by the Purchaser Indemnitees or Seller
Indemnitees in connection with the payment or incurrence of such Losses.

  



  

(d)  Subject to _Section 10.5(a)_ and _Section 10.5(b)_ , the
amount of Losses that may be recovered by the Purchaser Indemnitees or the
Seller Indemnitees pursuant to any and all claims made under this Agreement
shall be limited, individually and in the aggregate, to the Merger
Consideration, other than in the case of fraud.

  



  

(e)  The Indemnified Parties irrevocably waive any and all
rights that they may have to make claims (other than with respect to fraud)
against the Indemnifying Parties under statutory and common law as a result of
any Losses with respect to this Agreement whether or not in excess of the
maximum amounts permitted to be recovered pursuant to this _Article 10_.

  



  

Section 10.7   _No Contribution_. No Responsible Party or any of its
employees or agents shall have any right of contribution, right of indemnity
or other right or remedy against the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection
with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to which she, he
or it may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement.

Section 10.8   _Manner of Payment; Escrow_.

  



  

(a)  Any indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant
to this _Article 10_ shall be effected by (i) wire transfer of immediately
available funds from the Cash Escrow Amount to an account designated in
writing by the applicable Purchaser Indemnitees and (ii) delivery of Escrow
Shares (then remaining in the Escrow Account) equal in value (valued at the
Current Parent Market Price) to the amount of the indemnification owed by the
Sellers, within 15 days after the determination thereof, pro rata in amount
to the Escrow Shares and Cash Escrow Amount contributed to the Escrow
Account. Any indemnification of the Seller Indemnitees pursuant to this
_Article 10_ shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available
funds from the applicable Persons to an account designated in writing by the
applicable Seller Indemnitees, as the case may be, within 15 days after the
determination thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any indemnification
owed by the Sellers to the Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to Losses for
claims made with respect to breaches of the Fundamental Representations
pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ or for claims made pursuant to Section
_10.2(a)(iv)_ or _Section 10.2(a)(v)_ on or prior to the 180th Day (1) shall
also be satisfied by recourse to the Stock Consideration in addition to the
Escrow Amount, (2) shall not be extinguished after the 180th Day to the
extent a Notice of Claim shall have been delivered by Parent on or prior to
the 180th Day and (3) shall result in an extension of the Lock-Up Period (as
defined in the Stockholders Agreement) with respect to a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (valued at the Current Parent Market Price) necessary to
satisfy such claims equal to the amount of Losses described in the Notice of
Claim until such time as the claim in respect of such Losses shall have
finally been resolved.

  



  

(b)  Any funds or Escrow Shares remaining in the Escrow Account
as of the Release Date (other than the aggregate amount claimed by the
Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to claims made and not fully resolved prior to
such date) shall be released to the Representative (on behalf of the Sellers,
to be distributed to the Sellers in such amounts as are designated in the
Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule). At any time following the Release
Date, to the extent the funds and Escrow Shares held in the Escrow Account
exceed the aggregate amount (valuing such Escrow Shares at the Current Parent
Market Price) claimed by the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to claims made
prior to the Release Date, and not fully resolved prior to the time of
determination, the excess funds and Escrow Shares shall be promptly released
to the Representative (on behalf of the Sellers, to be distributed to the
Sellers in such amounts as are designated in the Merger Consideration
Allocation Schedule).

  

(c)  The Representative and the Surviving Corporation shall
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to make any distributions from the Escrow Account expressly provided
herein. Except as otherwise required pursuant to Applicable Law, for all Tax
purposes, Parent shall be treated as the owner of the Cash Escrow Amount in
the Escrow Account and Sellers shall be treated as the owners of the Escrow
Shares, and shall have voting and dividends rights with respect to the
Escrow Shares; _provided_ , _that_ , Parent shall be entitled to 40% of the
interest and other earnings with respect to the Cash Escrow Amount in the
Escrow Account.

  



  

Section 10.9   _Exclusive Remedy_. Except (i) in the case of fraud,

_Section 7.2_ ), and (iii) with respect to the matters covered by Section
2.10(b), and (iv) in the case where a Party seeks to obtain specific
performance of any term or provision of this Agreement, from and after the
Closing the rights of the Parties to indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article 10_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for
the Parties with respect to _Section 10.2(a)_ or _Section 10.2(b)_.

Section 10.10 _TRT Earnout Amount_. To the extent, and only to the extent,
that the Company actually pays all or a portion of the TRT Earnout Amount
(such amount or such portion, the " _Actual TRT Earnout Payment_ ") to the
recipients of the TRT Earnout, in accordance with the terms of the TRT
Earnout, then promptly following the later of the last day that any payments
would be required to be paid under the TRT Earnout and the resolution of any
disputes concerning the TRT Earnout between the Company and the recipients of
the TRT Earnout, Parent shall make an additional cash payment equal to the
difference of (x) the TRT Earnout Amount minus (y) Actual TRT Earnout
Payment, to the Sellers in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares promptly
following the date that the Company pays the Actual TRT Earnout Payment to
the recipients of the TRT Earnout.

--- 

    



  

  (v)  to refrain from enforcing any right of any Seller or the Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document in connection with the foregoing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such failure to act on the part of the Representative, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in the Escrow Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the Representative or by such Seller unless such waiver is in writing signed by the Representative; and

  



  

  (vi)  to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements, guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions, certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do any and all things and to take any and all action that the Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and all other agreements, documents or instruments referred to herein or therein or executed in connection herewith and therewith.

  



  

(b)  All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to

which actions or omissions shall be legally binding upon Sellers.

  



  

(d)  The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled
with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the
death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Seller, and (ii) shall
survive the consummation of the Merger.

  



  

(e)  The Representative will not be liable to the Sellers for
any act taken or omitted by it under this Agreement and the

its acceptance of such appointment in writing to Parent.

  



  

(g)  The Representative shall have reasonable access to
information about the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable assistance of
the Company's former officers and employees for purposes of performing its

any Indemnified Party to anyone (except to the Indemnifying Parties or the
Representative's employees, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors or
authorized representatives on a need to know basis, in each case who agree to
treat such information confidentially); _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to provide such
access or information if it determines, following advice from outside counsel,
that doing so would jeopardize the protection of attorney-client privilege.
The Representative shall enter into a separate customary
confidentiality agreement prior to being provided access to such information
if reasonably requested by Parent.

  



  

Section 11.2   _Expense Fund_. At the Closing, the Company will wire
transfer to the Representative an amount equal to $250,000 (the " _Expense
Fund_ "), which the Representative will use solely for the purpose of paying
directly, or reimbursing the Representative for, any third party expenses
incurred by the Representative pursuant to this Agreement. The Sellers will
not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Representative any ownership right that they may
otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Representative will
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a
result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Representative will
hold the funds in the Expense Fund separate from its other funds, will not use
such funds for its operating expenses or any other purposes and will not
voluntarily make the Expense Fund available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. Contemporaneous with or as soon as practicable following the
release in full of the Escrow Funds, the Representative will deliver the
balance of the Expense Fund to the Paying Agent (or such other entity selected
by Parent) for further distribution to the Sellers and among them in
proportion to their respective Pro Rata Share. The Expense Fund shall be
considered a Seller Expense.

Applicable Law (including the DGCL) and _Section 12.10_, this Agreement may
be amended or modified only by a written agreement executed and delivered by
duly authorized officers of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the

officers of Parent and the Representative. This Agreement may not be modified
or amended except as provided in the immediately preceding two sentences and
any purported amendment by any party or parties hereto effected in a manner
which does not comply with this _Section 12.9_ shall be void. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, _Section 9.3_, _Section 12.7_,
_Section 12.9_, _Section 12.12_ and _Section 12.13 _and this _Section

Section 12.10   _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, the
Company or the Representative (in each case on behalf of itself and Sellers)

the representations and warranties of Parent or Merger Sub contained herein
or in any document, certificate or writing delivered by Parent or Merger Sub

conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any Party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert
any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

  



  

Section 12.11   _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, may be executed in two or more counterparts and by
the Parties on separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and
delivered will be an original, but all of which together will constitute one
and the same instrument. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by
means of a fax machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail (any such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ "), will
be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and
will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party will raise the
use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of an Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to
the extent that such defense relates to the lack of authenticity.

Section 12.12   _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY
CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (a) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR
(b) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE
PARTIES IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED
HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES EACH HEREBY AGREES AND
CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE
DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY.

  



  

Section 12.13   _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each of the Parties submits to

New Castle County (and any appellate court thereof), and any federal court
sitting in Wilmington, Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, agrees that all claims in respect of the action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in any Chosen Court and agrees not to
bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby in any other court. Each of the
Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any
action or proceeding so brought. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Party will
bring any claim, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise, against any Debt Financing Source in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Commitment Letters or the performance thereof, anywhere other than in (i) any

Section 12.14   _Specific Performance_. Subject to the penultimate
sentence of this _Section 12.14_, the Parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions (including by refusing to
consummate the Merger in violation of this Agreement). Subject to the
following sentence, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or
other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including the obligations of
the parties hereto to consummate the Closing in accordance with  _Section
2.2_) in the Chosen Courts without proof of damages or otherwise, and that
such relief may be sought in addition to and shall not limit, diminish, or
otherwise impair, any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that
right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the
Company or any Company Related Party to seek an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing (i)
Parent's obligation to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt
Financing to be funded to fund the Merger (including using its reasonable
best efforts to enforce the provisions of the Debt Commitment Letters through
a Proceeding) and (ii) Parent's and Merger Sub's obligation (subject to the
condition that the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the
Closing) to consummate the Merger and the Closing, in each case, shall be
subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions: (A) all conditions in
_Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2 _are satisfied (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at Closing) at the
time when the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section 2.2_; (B)
all of the conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing provided for
in the Debt Commitment Letters have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
time of funding or conditions that failed to be satisfied as a result of a
breach by any Debt Financing Source); and (C) the Company is ready, willing
and able to consummate the Closing and confirms it will take such actions
within its reasonable control to cause the Closing to occur. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (A) the
other parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or (B) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this _Section 12.14_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction.
