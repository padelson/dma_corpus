iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of December 16, 2015, by and among TowneBank, a Virginia
banking corporation ("Buyer"), Monarch Financial Holdings, Inc., a Virginia
corporation ("Holding Company"), and Monarch Bank, a Virginia banking
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Holding Company ("Bank
Subsidiary").

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Buyer, Holding Company and Bank Subsidiary
have approved, and deem it advisable and in the best interests of their
respective stockholders to consummate, the business combination transactions
provided for herein, including the merger of Holding Company and Bank
Subsidiary with and into Buyer (the "Merger"); 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Buyer, Holding Company and Bank Subsidiary
have each determined that the Merger is consistent with, and will further,
their respective business strategies and goals; and

WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that, for federal income tax
purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
and that this Agreement shall constitute, and is adopted as, a "plan of
reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

The Merger and Related Matters

1.1 The Merger.

 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Date
(as defined in Section 1.2), Holding Company and Bank Subsidiary will be
merged with and into Buyer pursuant to the Plan of Merger attached hereto as
Exhibit 1.1 and made a part hereof (the "Plan of Merger"). The separate
corporate existence of each of Holding Company and Bank Subsidiary thereupon
shall cease, and Buyer will be the surviving corporation in the Merger. The
Merger will have the effect set forth in Section 13.1-721 of the Virginia
Stock Corporation Act (the "VSCA").

 

1.2 Effective Date; Closing.

 

(a) The Merger will become effective on the date and at the time shown on the
Articles of Merger required to be filed with the office of the Virginia State
Corporation Commission, as provided in Section 13.1-720 of the VSCA, effecting
the Merger (the "Effective Date"). Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article 6, the parties will use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the Effective Date to occur as soon as practicable after
all required  regulatory and stockholder approvals to consummate the Merger have been
received. At or after the Closing Date (as defined below), Buyer, Holding
Company and Bank Subsidiary will execute and deliver Articles of Merger
containing the Plan of Merger to the Virginia State Corporation Commission.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the
Merger will take place at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time at the corporate office
headquarters of Buyer on a date mutually agreed to by the parties and which
shall be held at or before the Effective Date (the "Closing Date"). All
documents required by this Agreement to be delivered at or before the
Effective Date will be exchanged by the parties on the Closing Date.

 

1.3 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Buyer.

 

(a) The Articles of Incorporation of Buyer as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Date will be the Articles of Incorporation of Buyer at and
after the Effective Date until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable law.

(b) Prior to the Effective Date, Buyer shall take all appropriate actions to
adopt an amendment to the Bylaws of Buyer to increase the number of directors
that may serve on the Board of Directors of Buyer to the extent necessary to
accommodate the current directors of Holding Company that will be appointed
as directors of Buyer as of the Effective Date as contemplated by Section 1.5.
The Bylaws of Buyer as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date will
be the Bylaws of Buyer at and after the Effective Date until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

1.4 Amendment of Holding Company Articles.

 

Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and the receipt of the Holding
Company Stockholder Approvals (as defined herein), immediately before the
Effective Date, Holding Company shall amend Article II of Holding Companys
Articles of Incorporation to read as follows (the "Holding Company Articles
Amendment") in order to enable the Holding Company to merge with and into
Buyer under Virginia law on the Effective Date: "The purposes for which the
corporation is formed is to transact banking business and trust business and
any or all lawful business related or incidental thereto, and such other
lawful business not required to be stated in the Articles of Incorporation
("Articles") in which a Virginia chartered banking corporation may engage
under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, as amended from time to time."

 

1.5 Corporate Governance.

 

At the Effective Date, Buyer shall cause each of Jeffrey F. Benson, E. Neal
Crawford, Jr., William T. Morrison, Robert M. Oman, Elizabeth T. Patterson,
Dwight C. Schaubach and Brad E. Schwartz to be appointed to the Board of
Directors of Buyer to serve in such capacity until the next annual meeting of
the stockholders of Buyer following the Effective Date, and, subject to the
good faith consideration by the Nominating Committee of Buyers Board of
Directors of the selection criteria set forth in its charter, such persons
shall be nominated to sit for election by

 



2  Buyers stockholders at such annual meeting of stockholders. If nominated,
each of Mr. Oman and Ms. Patterson will be nominated to serve an initial term
of one year, each of Messrs. Crawford, Morrison and Schaubach will be
nominated to serve an initial term of two years, and each of Messrs. Benson
and Schwartz will be nominated to serve an initial term of three years.
Subject to the good faith approval of Buyers Board of Directors, each of
Messrs. Benson and Schwartz will also be appointed to the Executive Committee
of Buyers Board of Directors and Mr. Benson will be appointed Vice Chairman
of Buyers Board of Directors effective at the Effective Date. Each of Lawton
H. Baker, Joe P. Covington, Jr., Virginia Sancilio Cross, Taylor B. Grissom
and Mr. Crawford will be appointed to the Board of Managers of Towne Financial
Services, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer, effective at the Effective
Date.

ARTICLE 2

 

Merger Consideration; Exchange Procedures

 

2.1 Conversion of Shares.

 

At the Effective Date, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Buyer, Holding Company or Bank Subsidiary or their respective
stockholders:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $1.667 per share, of Buyer ("Buyer
Common Stock") that is issued and outstanding immediately before the
Effective Date shall remain issued and outstanding and shall remain unchanged
by the Merger.

 

(b) Each share of common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of Holding Company
("Holding Company Common Stock") that is issued and outstanding immediately
before the Effective Date shall be converted into and exchanged for the right
to receive 0.8830 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of Buyer Common Stock, plus
cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.4 (collectively,
the "Merger Consideration"). All shares of Holding Company Common Stock
converted pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist as of
the Effective Date.

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of Bank Subsidiary
that is issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Date shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist as of the
Effective Date.

 

(d) Each certificate previously representing shares of Holding Company Common
Stock (a "Holding Company Common Certificate") shall cease to represent any
rights except the right to receive with respect to each underlying share of
Holding Company Common Stock (i) the Merger Consideration upon the surrender
of such Holding Company Common Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2,
and (ii) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.6.

 

(e) Each share of Holding Company Common Stock held by any party hereto and
each share of Buyer Common Stock held by Holding Company or any of the
Holding Company Subsidiaries (as defined herein) prior to the Effective Date
(in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity or on behalf of
third parties as a result of debts previously contracted) shall be 

 



3  cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist at the Effective Date and no
consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor; provided, that such shares
of Buyer Common Stock shall resume the status of authorized and unissued
shares of Buyer Common Stock.

2.2 Exchange Procedures.

 

(a) On or before the Closing Date, Buyer shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with its transfer agent or such other transfer agent or depository
or trust institution of recognized standing approved by Buyer (in such
capacity, the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of the Holding
Company Common Certificates, certificates representing the shares of
Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Article 2, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto and any cash to be paid in
lieu of fractional shares without any interest thereon (the "Exchange Fund"),
in exchange for certificates representing outstanding shares of Holding
Company Common Stock.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, Buyer shall cause
the Exchange Agent to send to each former stockholder of record of Holding
Company immediately before the Effective Date transmittal materials for use in
exchanging such stockholders Holding Company Common Certificates for the
Merger Consideration, as provided for herein.

(c) Buyer shall cause the Merger Consideration into which shares of Holding
Company Common Stock are converted at the Effective Date, and dividends or
distributions which a Holding Company stockholder shall be entitled to
receive, to be issued and paid to such Holding Company stockholder upon
delivery to the Exchange Agent of Holding Company Common Certificates
representing such shares of Holding Company Common Stock, together with the
transmittal materials duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto. No interest will accrue or be paid on any such cash to
be paid pursuant to Sections 2.4 or 2.6.

(d) Any Holding Company stockholder whose Holding Company Common Certificates
have been lost, destroyed, stolen or are otherwise missing shall be entitled
to the Merger Consideration and dividends or distributions to which such
stockholder shall be entitled upon compliance with reasonable conditions
imposed by Buyer pursuant to applicable law and as required in accordance
with Buyers standard policy (including the requirement that the stockholder
furnish a surety bond or other customary indemnity).

 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Holding Company for six (6) months after the Effective Date
shall be returned to Buyer (together with any earnings in respect thereof).
Any stockholders of Holding Company who have not complied with this Article 2
shall thereafter be entitled to look only to Buyer, and only as a general
creditor thereof, for payment of the consideration deliverable in respect of
each share of Holding Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

 

(f) None of the Exchange Agent, the parties hereto, the Buyer Subsidiaries (as
defined herein) nor the Holding Company Subsidiaries (as defined herein)
shall be liable to any stockholder of Holding Company for any amount of
property delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

 



4 2.3 Holding Company Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.

 

(a) At the Effective Date, each option (to the extent any are outstanding),
whether vested or unvested, to purchase shares of Holding Company Common
Stock (a "Holding Company Stock Option") granted under an equity or equity-
based compensation plan of Holding Company (a "Holding Company Stock Plan") or
otherwise granted shall be converted into an option (each, a "Replacement
Option") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under
such Holding Company Stock Option (except as provided otherwise in this
Section 2.3(a)), the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock subject to
the Holding Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Such
product shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. The exercise
price per share (rounded up to the next whole cent) of each Replacement
Option shall equal (y) the exercise price per share of shares of Holding
Company Common Stock that were purchasable pursuant to such Holding Company
Stock Option divided by (z) the Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Holding Company Stock Option that is intended to be an
"incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be
adjusted if necessary in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of
the Code and all other options shall be adjusted if necessary in a manner that
maintains the options exemption from Section 409A of the Code. At the
Effective Date, Buyer shall assume the Holding Company Stock Plans; provided
that such assumption shall only be with respect to the Replacement Options and
Buyer shall have no obligation to make any additional grants or awards under
the Holding Company Stock Plans.

 

(b) At the Effective Date, each restricted stock award granted under a Holding
Company Stock Plan (a "Holding Company Stock Award") which is unvested or
contingent and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date shall
cease, at the Effective Date, to represent any rights with respect to shares
of Holding Company Common Stock and shall be converted without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, into a restricted stock award of Buyer (a
"Replacement Stock Award"), on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the Holding Company Stock Awards (but taking into account any
changes thereto, including any acceleration of vesting thereof, provided for
in the Holding Company Stock Plan or in the related award document by reason
of the Merger). The number of shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to each
such Replacement Stock Award shall be equal to the number of shares of
Holding Company Common Stock subject to the Holding Company Stock Award
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole
share of Buyer Common Stock.

 

(c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, Buyer will deliver to the
holders of Replacement Options and Replacement Stock Awards any required
notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the respective Holding
Company Stock Plan and award documents and stating that such Replacement
Options and Replacement Stock Awards have been issued by Buyer and shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 2.3 after giving effect to the Merger and
the terms of the Holding Company Stock Plan).

 



5 2.4 No Fractional Shares.

 

Each holder of shares of Holding Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to
the Merger which would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Buyer Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Buyer Common Stock multiplied by the closing
sale price of Buyer Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the
trading day immediately preceding (but not including) the Effective Date.

 

2.5 Anti-Dilution.

In the event Buyer changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock issued and outstanding before the
Effective Date as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction, appropriate and
proportional adjustments will be made to the Exchange Ratio.

2.6 Dividends. 

No dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of Holding
Company Common Stock at, or as of, any time after the Effective Date will be
paid to the holder of any Holding Company Common Certificate until such holder
physically surrenders such certificate (or furnishes a surety bond or a
customary indemnity that such certificate is lost, destroyed, stolen
or otherwise missing as provided in Section 2.2(d)) for exchange as provided
in Section 2.2 of this Agreement, promptly after which time all such dividends
or distributions will be paid (without interest).

 

2.7 Withholding Rights.

 

The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person such
amounts, if any, it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax (as defined herein) law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority (as defined
herein) by the Exchange Agent, such amounts withheld will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such person in respect of

plan, as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, that provides benefits to an
employee at its expense after a termination of employment, except as required
by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985.

renew with respect to any insurance policy or bond or, within the last three
(3) calendar years, and since January 1, 2015, has been refused any insurance
coverage sought or applied for, and Holding Company has no reason to believe
that existing insurance coverage cannot be renewed as and when the same shall
expire upon terms and conditions as favorable as those presently in effect,
other than possible increases in premiums or unavailability of coverage that
do not result from any extraordinary loss experience on the part of Holding
Company or the Holding Company Subsidiaries.

savings and other pension plans; (B) all health, severance, insurance,
disability and other employee welfare plans; and (C) all employment, vacation
and other similar plans, all bonus, stock option, stock purchase, incentive,

and director benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and all employment
or compensation arrangements, in each case for the benefit of or relating to
its current and former employees and directors (collectively, the "Buyer
Benefit Plans").

 

(ii) Each Buyer Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be
so qualified, as reflected in a current favorable determination letter (based
on Internal Revenue Service permitted determination request procedures), or a
filing for the same has been made with the Internal Revenue Service seeking
such a determination letter and that request is still awaiting decision by the
Internal Revenue Service (based on Internal Revenue Service permitted
determination request procedures). Nothing has occurred since the date of any
such determination that is reasonably likely to affect adversely such
qualification or exemption, or result in the imposition of excise taxes or

qualified plan. There have been no "terminations," "partial terminations" or

renew with respect to any insurance policy or bond or, within the last three
(3) calendar years, and since January 1, 2015, has been refused any insurance
coverage sought or applied for, and Buyer has no reason to believe that
existing insurance coverage cannot be renewed as and when the same shall
expire upon terms and conditions as favorable as those presently in effect,
other than possible increases in premiums or unavailability of coverage that
do not result from any extraordinary loss experience on the part of Buyer or
the Buyer Subsidiaries.

 

 __(n) _Allowance for Loan Losses._

 

(i) All evidences of indebtedness reflected as assets by each of Buyer or any
of the Buyer Subsidiaries in its Securities Documents, Financial Statements

what they purport to be; (B) to the extent secured, secured by valid liens
and security interests which have been perfected; and (C) the legal, valid and

been asserted with respect to any such loan which if successful could have a
Material Adverse Effect.

compliance with all Environmental Laws. Neither Buyer nor any of the Buyer

Subsidiary is not in such compliance, and, to its Knowledge, there are no
present circumstances that would prevent or interfere with the continuation
of such compliance. To the Knowledge of Buyer, there are no past or present
actions, activities, circumstances, events, or incidents that could reasonably
form the 

 



31  bases of any Environmental Claim or other claim or action or governmental
investigation that could result in the imposition of any liability arising
under any Environmental Laws against Buyer or any of the Buyer Subsidiaries
or against any person or entity whose liability for any Environmental Claim
Buyer or an Buyer Subsidiary has or may have retained contractually or by
operation of law.

 

(p) _Books and Records_. The books and records of Buyer and those of the Buyer
Subsidiaries have been fully, properly and accurately maintained in all
material respects, and there are no material inaccuracies or discrepancies of
any kind contained or reflected therein.

 

(q) _CRA, Anti-Money Laundering, OFAC and Customer Information Security_.
Buyer has received a rating of "Satisfactory" or better in its most recent
examination or interim review with respect to the CRA. Buyer does not have
Knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would cause Buyer: (i) to be
deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the
CRA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a rating
for CRA purposes by federal bank regulators of lower than "Satisfactory"; or
(ii) to be deemed to be operating in violation in any material respect of the
Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, any order issued with respect to anti-
money laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign
Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-money laundering statute, rule
or regulation; or (iii) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in
any material respect with the applicable privacy of customer information
requirements contained in any federal and state privacy laws and regulations,

1999 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the provisions of
the information security program adopted by Buyer. To the Knowledge of Buyer,
no non-public customer information has been disclosed to or accessed by an
unauthorized third party in a manner which would cause either Buyer or any of
the Buyer Subsidiaries to undertake any remedial action. The Board of
Directors of Buyer (or where appropriate of any Buyer Subsidiary) has
adopted, and Buyer (or such Buyer Subsidiary) has implemented, an anti-money
laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification procedures that comply with Section 326 of the
USA PATRIOT Act and such anti-money laundering program meets the requirements
in all material respects of Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the
regulations thereunder, and Buyer (or such Buyer Subsidiary) has complied in
all material respects with any requirements to file reports and other
necessary documents as required by the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations
thereunder.

the votes entitled to be cast thereon is necessary to approve this Agreement

otherwise to approve this Agreement and the Merger.

of their respective officers, directors or employees has employed any broker,
finder or financial advisor or incurred any liability for any fees or
commissions in connection with transactions contemplated herein, except that,
in connection with this Agreement, Buyer has retained Sandler ONeill and
Partners, L.P. as its financial advisor (pursuant to an engagement letter, a
true and complete copy of which is included in Section 3.4(s) of Buyers
Disclosure Schedule and under which such firm will be entitled to certain
fees in connection with this Agreement).

 



32 (t) _Fairness Opinion_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of Buyer has received the opinion (which, if initially rendered
verbally, has been or will be confirmed by a written opinion, dated the same
date) of Sandler ONeill and Partners, L.P., to the effect that, as of the date
thereof and based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein, the
Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Holding Company Common Stock

the other party, unless such information is required to be included in any
filing required by law or in an application for any Regulatory Approval
required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, such
undertaking with respect to confidentiality to survive any termination of this
Agreement. In the case of information that a party believes is necessary in
making any such filing or obtaining any such Regulatory Approval, that party
will provide the other party a reasonable opportunity to review any such
filing or any application for such Regulatory Approval before it is filed
sufficient for it to comment on and object to the content of such filing or
application. If this Agreement is terminated, each party shall promptly return
to the furnishing party or, at the request of the furnishing party, destroy

the other party.

legal, financial and accounting advisors the opportunity to review
and provide comments: (i) upon such Joint Proxy Statement a reasonable time

Proxy Statement, all amendments and supplements thereto and all responses to
requests for additional information, and shall not include any information in
the foregoing about a party or its officers, directors, business,
arrangements, operations or stock or the Merger that has not been approved by
the other party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Each party agrees to cooperate with the other party and the
other partys counsel and accountants in requesting and obtaining appropriate
opinions, consents, analyses and letters from its financial advisor and
independent auditor in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement. Each party
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement
to be cleared by the SEC and FDIC for use in definitive form as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the preliminary filing thereof and to cause a
definitive Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to their respective
stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter. Buyer also
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state
securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



40 (b) Each party agrees, as to itself and its subsidiaries, that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement
thereto shall, at the date(s) of mailing to stockholders and the time of the
Buyer Stockholders Meeting and the Holding Company Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading. Each party further agrees that if it becomes aware that any
information furnished by it that would cause any of the statements in the
Joint Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material
fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other
party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the Joint Proxy
Statement.

 

(c) Holding Company agrees to advise Buyer, promptly after Holding Company
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Joint Proxy Statement has been
cleared by the SEC for use in definitive form or when any supplement or
amendment has been filed, of the initiation or, to the extent Buyer is aware
thereof, threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, of any request by the
SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Joint Proxy Statement or for
additional information or of any other correspondence from the SEC in
connection with the Joint Proxy Statement that relates to Buyer or the Merger.

between Holding Company (or any of its representatives and advisors on Holding
Companys behalf), on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand as it
relates to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Merger. Buyer agrees to advise
Holding Company, promptly after Buyer receives notice thereof, of the time
when the Joint Proxy Statement has been cleared by the FDIC for use in

Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or,
to the extent Buyer is aware thereof, threat of any proceeding for any such
purpose, of any request by the FDIC for the amendment or supplement of the

Company Subsidiaries and Holding Companys and the Holding Company
Subsidiaries officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives
(including any financial advisor, attorney or accountant retained by Holding
Company or any of the Holding Company Subsidiaries) not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or encourage inquiries or proposals with
respect to, (ii) furnish any confidential or nonpublic information relating
to, or (iii) engage or participate in any negotiations or discussions
concerning, an Acquisition Proposal (as defined herein).

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 5.5 shall
prohibit Holding Company, prior to its meeting of stockholders to be held
pursuant to Section 5.3 and

 



41  subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 5.5, from
furnishing nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, any person or entity that makes an unsolicited, bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal with respect to Holding Company (that did not
result from a breach of this Section 5.5) if, and only to the extent that (i)
the Holding Company Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after
consultation with and based upon the written advice of outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such actions would be more likely than not to result
in a violation of its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable
law, (ii) before taking such actions, Holding Company receives from such
person or entity an executed confidentiality agreement providing for
reasonable protection of confidential information, which confidentiality
agreement shall not provide such person or entity with any exclusive right to
negotiate with Holding Company, and (iii) the Holding Company Board of
Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined below).
Holding Company shall immediately (within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Buyer
orally and in writing of Holding Companys receipt of any such proposal or
inquiry, the material terms and conditions thereof, the identity of the person
making such proposal or inquiry, and will keep Buyer apprised of any material
related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis,
including by providing a copy of all material documentation or correspondence
relating thereto.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, an "Acquisition Proposal" means, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or
inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, any of the
following transactions involving Holding Company or Bank Subsidiary: (i) a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction; (ii)
any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of ten percent (10%) or more
of the consolidated assets of Holding Company or ten percent (10%) or more of
any class of equity or voting securities of Holding Company or the Holding
Company Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute more than ten percent (10%) of the consolidated assets of Holding
Company; or (iii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange
offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially
owning ten percent (10%) or more of any class of equity or voting securities
of Holding Company or the Holding Company Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than ten percent (10%) of
the consolidated assets of Holding Company.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means an
unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by a person or
entity (or group of persons or entities acting in concert within the meaning
of Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) that the Board of Directors of Holding
Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial and
outside legal advisors, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and including the terms and
conditions of this Agreement (A) is more favorable to the stockholders of
Holding Company from a financial point of view, than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (B) is fully financed or reasonably capable
of being fully financed and reasonably likely to receive all required
approvals of Governmental Authorities and otherwise reasonably capable of
being completed on the terms proposed; provided that, for purposes of this
definition of "Superior Proposal," the Acquisition Proposal 

 



42  shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.5(c), except the
reference to "ten percent (10%) or more" in such definition shall be deemed to
be a reference to "a majority" and "Acquisition Proposal" shall only be
deemed to refer to a transaction involving Holding Company or Bank Subsidiary.

 

(e) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including Section 7.1),
nothing in this Section 5.5 shall permit Holding Company to terminate this
Agreement or affect any other obligation of Holding Company under this
Agreement.

employees of Holding Company and the Holding Company Subsidiaries, who at or
after the Effective Date become employees of Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiaries
("Holding Company Continuing Employees"), employee benefits under the Buyer
Benefit Plans (with no break in coverage), on terms and conditions which are
the same as for similarly situated officers and employees of Buyer and the
Buyer Subsidiaries; or (ii) maintain for the benefit of the Holding Company
Continuing Employees, the Holding Company Benefit Plans maintained by Holding
Company immediately prior to the Effective Date; provided that Buyer may take
action to amend any Holding Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Date to comply with any law or, so long as the benefits provided
under those Holding Company Benefit Plans following such amendment are no
less favorable to the Holding Company Continuing Employees than benefits
provided by Buyer to its officers and employees under any comparable Buyer
Benefit Plans, as necessary and appropriate for other business reasons.

(b) For purposes of participation, vesting and benefit accrual (except not for
purposes of benefit accrual with respect to any plan in which such credit
would result in a duplication of benefits) under the Buyer Benefit Plans,
service with or credited by Holding Company or any of the Holding Company
Subsidiaries shall be treated as service with Buyer. To the extent permitted
under applicable law, Buyer shall cause welfare Buyer Benefit Plans maintained
by Buyer that cover the Holding Company Continuing Employees after the
Effective Date to (i) waive any waiting period and restrictions and
limitations for preexisting conditions or insurability, and (ii) cause any
deductible, co-insurance, or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by the
Holding Company Continuing Employees under welfare Holding Company Benefit
Plans to be credited to such Holding Company Continuing Employees under
welfare Buyer Benefit Plans, so as to reduce the amount of any deductible, co-
insurance or maximum out-of-pocket payments payable by such Holding Company
Continuing Employees under welfare Buyer Benefit Plans.

(c) Each employee of Holding Company or any Holding Company Subsidiary at the
Effective Date whose employment is involuntarily terminated other than for
cause by Buyer after the Effective Date, but on or before the date that is six

providing for severance, shall be entitled to receive severance in accordance

a copy of which is included in Schedule 5.10(c) of Holding Companys
Disclosure Schedule.

 



44 (d) With respect to Holding Companys 401(k) plan, Holding Company shall cause
such plan to be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Date,
in accordance with applicable law and subject to the receipt of all applicable
regulatory or governmental approvals. Each Holding Company Continuing Employee
who was a participant in the Holding Company 401(k) plan and who continues in
the employment of Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary shall be eligible to
participate in Buyers 401(k) plan on or as soon as administratively
practicable after the Effective Date, and account balances under the
terminated Holding Company 401(k) plan will be eligible for distribution or
rollover, including direct rollover, to Buyers 401(k) for Holding Company
Continuing Employees. Any other former employee of Holding Company or
the Holding Company Subsidiaries who is employed by Buyer or the Buyer
Subsidiaries after the Effective Date shall be eligible to be a participant in
the Buyer 401(k) plan upon complying with eligibility requirements. All rights
to participate in Buyers 401(k) plan are subject to Buyers right to amend
or terminate the plan. For purposes of administering Buyers 401(k) plan,
service with Holding Company and the Holding Company Subsidiaries shall be
deemed to be service with Buyer for participation and vesting purposes, but
not for purposes of benefit accrual.

from and after the Effective Date, from amending, modifying or terminating any
Buyer Benefit Plans or Holding Company Benefit Plans or any other contracts,
arrangements, commitments or plans of either party in accordance with their
terms and applicable law.

nonassessable.

 

(b) Buyer shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Buyer
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the

5.12 Indemnification; Insurance.

 

(a) Following the Effective Date, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless any person who has rights to indemnification from Holding Company,
to the same extent and on the same conditions as such person was entitled to
indemnification pursuant to applicable law and Holding Companys
Organizational Documents, as in effect on the date of this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, in any case in which corporate approval may be
required to effectuate any indemnification, Buyer shall direct, if the party
to be indemnified elects, that the determination of permissibility of
indemnification shall be made by independent counsel mutually agreed upon
between Buyer and the indemnified party.

(b) Buyer shall, at or prior to the Effective Date, purchase a six (6) year
"tail" prepaid policy on the same terms and conditions as the existing
directors and officers liability (and

 



45  fiduciary) insurance maintained by Holding Company from insurance carriers
with comparable credit ratings, covering, without limitation, the Merger;
provided, however, that the cost of such "tail" policy shall in no event
exceed two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the amount of the last annual
premium paid by Holding Company for such existing directors and officers
liability (and fiduciary) insurance. If, but for the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence, Buyer would be required to expend more than
two hundred fifty percent (250%) of current annual premiums, Buyer will obtain
the maximum amount of that insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums
equal to two hundred fifty percent (250%) of current annual premiums.

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.12 are intended to be for the benefit of
and shall be enforceable by each indemnified party and his or her heirs and
representatives.

and deferred compensation agreements or arrangements that Holding Company and

shall be superseded on or after the Effective Date.

hereto.

Holding Company has set forth in Section 5.14 of Holding Companys Disclosure
Schedule a complete and accurate list of the deadlines for extensions or
terminations of all material leases, agreements or licenses (including
specifically real property leases and data processing agreements) to which
Holding Company or any of the Holding Company Subsidiaries is a party.

5.15 Takeover Laws.

 

If any federal or state anti-takeover laws or regulations may become, or may
purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party
hereto and the members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary and legally permissible so
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act
to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such laws or regulations on any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

of effecting the combination of Buyer and Holding Company (including the
provisions of Article 1), if and to the extent they both deem such change to
be necessary, appropriate or desirable; provided that no such change shall (i)
alter or change the Exchange Ratio or amount of cash to be received by Holding
Company stockholders in exchange for each share of Holding Company Common
Stock, (ii) adversely affect the tax treatment of Buyer or Holding Company
pursuant to this Agreement or (iii) materially impede or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely
manner. The parties hereto agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate
amendment to this Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with
Section 8.3.

Prior to the Effective Date, each of Holding Company and Bank Subsidiary
shall, consistent with GAAP and applicable banking laws and regulations,
modify or change its respective Loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, Tax, litigation
and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan
classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is
consistent with that of Buyer; provided, however, that no such modifications
or changes need be made prior to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Section 6.1(b).

 

5.18 Shareholder Litigation.

 

Each of Buyer and Holding Company shall give the other prompt notice of any

five (5)-day period, it shall give prompt written notice to Holding Company of
such election and the revised applicable Exchange Ratio, whereupon no
termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 7.1(l) and this
Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the
applicable Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified).

Effective Date shall remain issued and outstanding and shall remain unchanged
by the Merger.

 

(b) Each share of common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of Holding Company
("Holding Company Common Stock") that is issued and outstanding immediately
before the Effective Date shall be converted into and exchanged for the right
to receive 0.8830 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of Buyer Common Stock, plus
cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.4 (collectively,
the "Merger Consideration").

 



A-1 (c) All shares of Holding Company Common Stock converted pursuant to this
Section 2.1 shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Date.

(d) Each share of common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of Bank Subsidiary
that is issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Date shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist as of the

(e) Each certificate previously representing shares of Holding Company Common

Holding Company Common Stock (i) the Merger Consideration upon the surrender
of such Holding Company Common Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2,
and (ii) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.6.

 

(f) Each share of Holding Company Common Stock held by any party hereto and
each share of Buyer Common Stock held by Holding Company or any of the

Effective Date (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity or
on behalf of third parties as a result of debts previously contracted) shall
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist at the Effective Date and
no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor; provided, that such
shares of Buyer Common Stock shall resume the status of authorized and
unissued shares of Buyer Common Stock.

 

2.2 Exchange Procedures.

deposited, with its transfer agent or such other transfer agent or depository
or trust institution of recognized standing approved by Buyer (in such
capacity, the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of the Holding
Company Common Certificates, certificates representing the shares of
Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Article 2, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto and any cash to be paid in
lieu of fractional shares without any interest thereon (the "Exchange Fund"),
in exchange for certificates representing outstanding shares of Holding
Company Common Stock.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, Buyer shall cause
the Exchange Agent to send to each former stockholder of record of Holding
Company immediately before the Effective Date transmittal materials for use in
exchanging such stockholders Holding Company Common Certificates for the
Merger Consideration, as provided for herein.

(c) Buyer shall cause the Merger Consideration into which shares of Holding
Company Common Stock are converted at the Effective Date, and dividends or
distributions which a Holding Company stockholder shall be entitled to
receive, to be issued and paid to such Holding Company stockholder upon
delivery to the Exchange Agent of Holding Company

 



A-2  Common Certificates representing such shares of Holding Company Common
Stock, together with the transmittal materials duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto. No interest will accrue or be paid
on any such cash to be paid pursuant to Sections 2.4 or 2.6.

furnish a surety bond or other customary indemnity).

stockholders of Holding Company for six (6) months after the Effective Date

creditor thereof, for payment of the consideration deliverable in respect of
each share of Holding Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Plan of Merger, without any interest thereon.

 

(f) None of the Exchange Agent, the parties hereto, the Buyer Subsidiaries (as
defined in the Agreement) nor the Holding Company Subsidiaries (as defined in

abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

2.3 Holding Company Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.

 

(a) At the Effective Date, each option (to the extent any are outstanding),
whether vested or unvested, to purchase shares of Holding Company Common
Stock (a "Holding Company Stock Option") granted under an equity or equity-
based compensation plan of Holding Company (a "Holding Company Stock Plan") or
otherwise granted shall be converted into an option (each, a "Replacement
Option") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under
such Holding Company Stock Option (except as provided otherwise in this
Section 2.3(a)), the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock subject to
the Holding Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Such
product shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. The exercise
price per share (rounded up to the next whole cent) of each Replacement
Option shall equal (y) the exercise price per share of shares of Holding
Company Common Stock that were purchasable pursuant to such Holding Company
Stock Option divided by (z) the Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Holding Company Stock Option that is intended to be an
"incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) shall be adjusted if necessary in
accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and all other
options shall be adjusted if necessary in a manner that maintains the options
exemption from Section 409A of the Code. At the Effective Date, Buyer shall
assume the Holding Company Stock Plans; provided that such assumption shall
only be with respect to the Replacement Options and Buyer shall have no
obligation to make any additional grants or awards under the Holding Company
Stock Plans.

 



A-3 (b) At the Effective Date, each restricted stock award granted under a Holding
Company Stock Plan (a "Holding Company Stock Award") which is unvested or
contingent and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date shall
cease, at the Effective Date, to represent any rights with respect to shares
of Holding Company Common Stock and shall be converted without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, into a restricted stock award of Buyer (a
"Replacement Stock Award"), on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the Holding Company Stock Awards (but taking into account
any changes thereto, including any acceleration of vesting thereof, provided
for in the Holding Company Stock Plan or in the related award document by
reason of the Merger). The number of shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to
each such Replacement Stock Award shall be equal to the number of shares of
Holding Company Common Stock subject to the Holding Company Stock Award
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole
share of Buyer Common Stock.

(c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, Buyer will deliver to the
holders of Replacement Options and Replacement Stock Awards any required
notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the respective Holding
Company Stock Plan and award documents and stating that such Replacement
Options and Replacement Stock Awards have been issued by Buyer and shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 2.3 after giving effect to the Merger and
the terms of the Holding Company Stock Plan).

 

2.4 No Fractional Shares.

 

Each holder of shares of Holding Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to
the Merger which would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Buyer Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Buyer Common Stock multiplied by the closing
sale price of Buyer Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the
trading day immediately preceding (but not including) the Effective Date.

 

2.5 Anti-Dilution.

In the event Buyer changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock issued and outstanding before the
Effective Date as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction, appropriate and
proportional adjustments will be made to the Exchange Ratio.

2.6 Dividends. 

No dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of Holding
Company Common Stock at, or as of, any time after the Effective Date will be
paid to the holder of any Holding Company Common Certificate until such holder
physically surrenders such certificate

 



A-4  (or furnishes a surety bond or a customary indemnity that such certificate
is lost, destroyed, stolen or otherwise missing as provided in Section 2.2(d))
for exchange as provided in Section 2.2 of this Plan of Merger, promptly
after which time all such dividends or distributions will be paid (without
interest).

 

2.7 Withholding Rights.

 

The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Plan of Merger to any person
such amounts, if any, it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax (as defined in the Agreement) law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority (as
defined in the Agreement) by the Exchange Agent, such amounts withheld will be
treated for all purposes of this Plan of Merger as having been paid to such
person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Exchange Agent.

2.8 No Appraisal Rights.

 

In accordance with Section 13.1-730 of the VSCA, no appraisal rights shall be
available to the holders of Holding Company Common Stock in connection with
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger.

ARTICLE 3

 

Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Buyer

 

(a) The Articles of Incorporation of Buyer as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Date will be the Articles of Incorporation of Buyer at and
after the Effective Date until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable law.

(b) Prior to the Effective Date, Buyer shall take all appropriate actions to
adopt an amendment to the Bylaws of Buyer to increase the number of directors
that may serve on the Board of Directors of Buyer to the extent necessary to
accommodate the current directors of Holding Company that will be appointed
as directors of Buyer as of the Effective Date as contemplated by Section 1.5
of the Agreement. The Bylaws of Buyer as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Date will be the Bylaws of Buyer at and after the Effective

(ii) Liens, if any, which have been disclosed to Buyer in writing.

 



B-2 (f) _Consents and Approvals_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
