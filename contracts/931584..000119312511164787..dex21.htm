at least $82,000,000 for the purchase of the Owned Real Property, the
construction of buildings, the purchase and installation of equipment and
improvements to the Owned Real Property, and other permitted expenses. 
---|---|---

---|---|--- ---|---|--- 
  ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT |  | PAGE 8 



 





      | (c) | On or before June 30, 2011, Sellers shall provide
Purchaser with an independent third party audit (the "Independent Report")
prepared by the Accounting Firm setting out the amounts (the "Independent
Report Costs") paid by Sellers, net of all rebates and discounts for the
purchase of the Owned Real Property, the construction of buildings, the
purchase and installation of equipment and improvements to the Owned Real
Property as of May 31, 2011 (the "Independent Report Date"). The Independent
Report shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions set forth in
Schedule 1.11(c) and shall include confirmation: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | that the Independent Report Costs were paid, 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | of the amount of the Assumed Accounts Payable; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | that the items of machinery and equipment set out in the
Independent Report were located at the Owned Real Property as of the
Independent Report Date, were in transit, or were under construction at a
vendors facility as of the Independent Report Date. 
---|---|--- 

The Sellers and the Purchaser shall agree upon the Independent Report and the
Independent Report Costs within five business days following delivery of the
Independent Report by the Accounting Firm. If the Sellers and the Purchaser do
not agree within the period of time allotted for so doing, then either party
may submit the determination to the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall
act as an arbitrator to determine the Independent Report and the Independent
Report Costs, based solely on presentations by Purchaser and Sellers (and not
by independent review). The Accounting Firm shall make its determination
within five business days and its determination shall be final and binding for
all purposes. The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred in
connection with such arbitration shall be borne equally by Sellers and
Purchaser.

If and to the extent that the Independent Report Costs set forth on the
Independent Report are greater than or less than $82,000,000, such difference
(the "Closing Cash Adjustment Amount") shall be added to or deducted from the
cash portion of the Purchase Price as the case may be.



     | (d) | Not more than 10 business days following the Closing Date,
Sellers shall provide Purchaser with an independent third party audit (the

net of all rebates and discounts for the purchase of the Owned Real Property,
the construction of buildings, the purchase and installation of equipment and
improvements to the Owned Real Property during the period beginning on the
Independent Report Date and ending on the Closing Date. The Independent
Supplemental Report shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions set
forth in Schedule 1.11(c) and shall include confirmation: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | that the Independent Supplemental Report Costs were paid, 
---|---|--- ---|---|--- 
  ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT |  | PAGE 9 



 





      | (ii) | the amount of the Assumed Accounts Payable; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | that the items of machinery and equipment set out in the
Independent Accountant Reports were located at the Owned Real Property as of
the Closing Date, were in transit, or were under construction at a vendors
facility as of the Closing Date. 
---|---|--- 

The Sellers and the Purchaser shall agree upon the Independent Supplemental
Report and the Independent Supplemental Report Costs within five business days
following delivery of the Independent Supplement Report by the Accounting
Firm. If the Sellers and the Purchaser do not agree within the period of time
allotted for so doing, then either party may submit the determination to the
Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator to determine
the Independent Supplemental Report and the Independent Supplemental Report
Costs, based solely on presentations by Purchaser and Sellers (and not by
independent review). The Accounting Firm shall make its determination within
five business days and its determination shall be final and binding for
all purposes. The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred in
connection with such arbitration shall be borne equally by Sellers and
Purchaser.

If and to the extent that the Independent Report Costs and the Independent
Supplemental Report Costs set forth on the Independent Report and the
Independent Supplemental Report, as finally resolved, are greater than or
less than $82,000,000, such difference (the "Final Cash Adjustment Amount")
shall be paid to Sellers or Purchaser, as the case may be. Any Final Cash
Adjustment Amount to be paid by Purchaser shall be paid in immediately
available funds within three business days. Any Final Cash Adjustment Amount
to be paid by Sellers shall be paid to the Purchaser from the Escrow Amount
(to the extent there are sufficient funds).

     | (a) | The Purchase Price shall be allocated between Sellers as set
forth on Schedule 1.12(a). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

The Purchase Price together with the Assumed Liabilities shall be allocated
among the Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities in the manner set forth in
Schedule 1.12(a) in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 1060
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and the U.S.  

---|---|--- ---|---|--- 
  ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT |  | PAGE 10 



 





      |

 Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and any applicable comparable
provisions of state, local and foreign Tax law (the "Purchase Price
Allocation"). The Purchase Price Allocation made pursuant to this Section
1.12 shall be binding on Purchasers and Sellers for all Tax reporting
purposes. To the extent required, each party agrees to timely file an IRS Form
8594 reflecting the Purchase Price Allocation for the taxable year that
includes the Closing Date and to make any timely filing required by applicable
state, local and foreign laws. 

---|--- 



     | (c) | Any amount that is to be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price and such adjustment shall be allocated among the Acquired
Assets in accordance with the Purchase Price Allocation method provided in
Section 1.12(a). 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Each party hereto shall adopt and utilize the Purchase Price
Allocation for purposes of all Tax returns filed by them and shall not
voluntarily take any position inconsistent with the foregoing in connection
with any examination of any Tax return, any refund claim, and any litigation
proceeding or otherwise. In the event that the Purchase Price Allocation is
disputed by any taxing authority, the party receiving notice of the dispute
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto of such dispute and such
parties shall cooperate in good faith in responding to such dispute in order
to preserve the effectiveness of the Purchase Price Allocation.  
---|---|--- 

1.13 _Non-Assignable Contracts and Rights_. To the extent that the assignment
by any Seller of any contract, property, right, or asset to be assigned to
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement shall require the consent or approval of
any other party, and the consent or approval shall not have been obtained at
the time of Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute a contract to assign
the same if an attempted assignment would constitute a breach thereof or would
in any way adversely affect the rights of Sellers (or Purchaser, as assignee)
thereunder. Other than with respect to those consents identified in Schedule
6.2(a) (which shall be a condition to Closing), if any such consent or
approval is required but not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, then:

 



     | (a) | The respective Seller and Purchaser shall continue to seek
such consent or approval after Closing for a period ending on the twelve-month
anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however, that such obligation
shall be of no further force or effect if such Seller and Purchaser reasonably
determine that such consent or approval will not be forthcoming during such
period; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Subject to clause (c) below, each Seller will cooperate with
Purchaser in any lawful and economically feasible arrangement to provide that
Purchaser shall receive the interest of that Seller in the benefits under any
such instrument, contract, lease or permit or other agreement or arrangement,
including performance by such Seller, as agent, if economically feasible, of
its obligations thereunder; and  
---|---|--- ---|---|--- 
  ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT |  | PAGE 11 



 





      | (c) | The respective Sellers obligations under the preceding
clause (b) shall be conditioned upon Purchasers undertaking to pay or satisfy

extent Purchaser would have been responsible therefor hereunder if the
respective consent or approval had been obtained.

---|---|--- 



     | (d) | _Tolling of Restriction Period_. In the event of breach by
any Restricted Party of any covenant set forth in paragraph (a) and paragraph
(b) of this Section 4.8, as determined by agreement among the parties hereto
or by arbitrators or by a court of competent jurisdiction, the term of such
covenant shall be extended by the period of the duration of such breach.  
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | _Severability_. The parties intend that the covenants made
in this Section 4.8 shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under
the laws of any applicable jurisdiction, and acknowledge that these covenants
are required and appropriate in scope and duration for the adequate protection
of the businesses of Purchaser and to induce Purchaser to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. If any
provision or term of this Section 4.8 is held to be prohibited by or invalid,
then such provision or term shall be ineffective only to the extent of the
prohibition or invalidity thereof, without invalidating or affecting in any
manner whatsoever the remainder of such provision or term or the remaining
provisions or terms of this Section 4.8. If any of the covenants set forth in
this Section 4.8 are held to be unreasonable, arbitrary or against public
policy, such covenants shall be considered divisible with respect to scope,

shall be effective, binding and enforceable against the breaching party. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | _Remedies_. If any Restricted Party breaches the covenants
set forth in this Section 4.8, Purchaser shall be entitled to the following
remedies:

severally) the amount of any loss, liability, claim, damage (excluding lost

and defense and reasonable attorneys fees) or diminution of value, whether or
not involving a third party claim, arising, directly or indirectly, from or in
connection with the breach;  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | In addition and not in lieu of its other remedies hereunder
and at law, to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief to restrain any
breach or threatened breach or otherwise to enforce specifically the
provisions of this Section 4.8, it being agreed that money damages alone will
be inadequate to compensate Purchaser and will be an inadequate remedy for
such breach.

The rights and remedies of the parties under this Section 4.8 are cumulative
and not alternative.

4.9 _Bulk Sales Laws_. Purchaser hereby waives compliance with the provisions
of any bulk sales law applicable to the transfer of the Acquired Assets.

4.10 _Regulation S-X and Audited Financial Statements_. Pursuant to the

amended, Purchaser may be required to include certain audited historical
consolidated financial statements of Sellers and their subsidiaries and
related pro forma financial information in a Current Report on Form 8-K
required by applicable federal securities laws (the "Form 8-K"). Accordingly,
prior to the Closing, Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to
furnish to Purchaser, upon the request of Purchaser, any financial
statements, information or other documents that are reasonably requested by
Purchaser in connection with the preparation of any information required to be
included in the Form 8-K. In addition, prior to the Closing, Sellers shall
use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the agreement of an independent
registered public accounting firm that is registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board that it will, subject to its reasonable review of
the Form 8-K and the completion of its customary procedures in connection
therewith, provide its consent to the inclusion of such firms opinion with
respect to any audited financial statements of Sellers to be included in the
Form 8-K, with such consent to be filed as an exhibit to the Form 8-K.
Purchaser shall reimburse Sellers for any out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by Sellers in connection with taking any actions requested by
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 4.10.

4.11 _Exclusivity_. Until this Agreement is terminated by its terms, Sellers
will not (and will not cause or permit any affiliate, director, officer,
employee, stockholder or its agent to) directly or indirectly (a) solicit,
initiate or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any
individual or entity (including any of them) relating to any (i) liquidation,
dissolution or recapitalization of, (ii) merger or consolidation with or into,
(iii) acquisition or purchase of any material asset (or any material portion
of the assets) of, or any equity interest in, or (iv) similar transaction or
business combination involving the Sellers or the Business; or (b) participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish any information with
respect to, assist or participate in, or facilitate in any other manner any
effort or attempt by any other party to do or seek any of the foregoing.



   5. | _Employees and Employee Benefit Plans_ 
---|--- 

5.1 _General_. Purchaser shall offer employment to each of the Business
employees (the "Sellers Employees") actively employed by Sellers as of the
Effective Time (excluding employees on any type leave, provided that
employees on maternity leave or other employees on short-term disability leave
will be offered employment by Purchaser upon their termination of such
maternity or short-term disability leave), provided however, that Purchaser
reserves the right to require any Sellers Employee to take and pass, to the
reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser, a pre-employment physical by a doctor
that will confirm that such Sellers Employee is fit for his position with
the Business. Schedule 5.1 sets forth a current list of the Sellers
Employees, their status, job title, location, business unit, function, date of
hire, years of ---|---|--- 
  ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT |  | PAGE 35 



 





 

 credited service, hourly or salaried designation, and annual salary or
hourly wage. The Sellers shall advise the Purchaser as to changes to Schedule
5.1 from time to time. The Purchaser shall employ those Sellers Employees
who accept the offer of employment with the Purchaser, in accordance with the
terms and conditions offered to them (the "Transferred Employees") provided
that any such employment will be "at will" and subject to termination
subsequent to the Closing Date for any reason, with or without cause.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
Sellers Employees on maternity leave and short-term disability leave shall
be deemed "Transferred Employees" only upon their acceptance of Purchasers
offer of employment, after their actual return to active employment with
Purchaser. Purchasers liability with respect to such employees (if at all)
will begin as of the date of such actual return to employment; and Sellers
liability with respect to such employees will continue until the date of such
actual return to employment. For purposes of allocating liabilities and
responsibilities under this Section 5, any reference to the "Effective Time",
solely with respect to Sellers Employees on maternity leave and short-term
disability leave as of the Closing Date, shall be deemed to be the date upon
which such employees complete their leave and get back to active work with the
Purchaser (if at all).

5.2  _Employment Continuity_. Nothing herein shall be construed as giving any
Transferred Employee any right to continued employment, or, except as
expressly provided in Section 5, to employment upon any terms or conditions
with Purchaser following the Effective Time. Except where expressly otherwise
provided, nothing herein shall limit the right of Purchaser at any time after
Closing to terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee, to modify the
terms and conditions of employment of any Transferred Employee, or to amend
or terminate any employee benefit plan or arrangement covering any Transferred
Employee.

5.3 _WARN or Other Required Notices to Employees_. Purchaser shall cooperate
with Sellers in making any notices required by the Workers Adjustment
Retraining Notification Act or other similar applicable domestic or foreign
law, regulation or ordinance prior to the Closing Date in respect of the
Sellers Employees.

5.4 _Credit for Service Before Closing_. Purchaser shall grant service credit
to all Transferred Employees under Purchasers employee benefit plans for
eligibility, vesting, and for benefit calculation purposes for vacation and
disability-related benefits equal to years of service with Sellers, for such
Transferred Employees.

5.5 _Welfare Benefit Plan Participation_. Purchaser shall offer health care
insurance benefits to all Transferred Employees employed by Purchaser and such
Transferred Employees eligible dependents as of the date of Closing.
Purchaser shall use its best commercial efforts to cause any preexisting
condition restrictions or waiting period under Purchasers welfare plans to be
waived for a Transferred Employee (to the extent covered by a plan sponsored
by Sellers.

5.6 _Allocation of Certain Liabilities_. Except as otherwise provided
in Section 5.7, Sellers shall retain (as Excluded Liabilities) and be
responsible for, and/or otherwise indemnify Purchaser from, all liabilities
and obligations of Sellers to any Sellers Employees, and other  ---|---|--- 
  ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT |  | PAGE 36 



 





 

 current and former employees associated with the Business and their eligible
dependents incurred prior to the Effective Time, in connection with any Plan
or Employee Arrangement. Purchaser shall be responsible for all liabilities
and obligations in connection with claims incurred after the Effective Time by
Transferred Employees under any of Purchasers employee benefit plans
established by Purchaser covering such Transferred Employees after the
Effective Time. For purposes of this Section 5, a hospitalization claim shall
be deemed incurred on the first day of such hospitalization and a disability
claim shall be incurred on the date that the disability event occurred; it
being understood that Purchaser shall be responsible for any disability
absences commencing after the Effective Time by any Transferred Employee. A
group health plan or plans of Sellers shall be responsible for any
continuation of group health coverage required under Section 4980B of the
Code, Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA or any similar state, provincial or
local law, with respect to any "MandA qualified beneficiary" (as defined in
regulations issued under Section 4980B of the Code) with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Seller Transaction
Documents. Purchaser shall be responsible for any continuation of group health
coverage required under Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 through 608
of ERISA with respect to any Transferred Employee or any "qualified
beneficiary" with respect to any Transferred Employee (as defined in Section
4980B of the Code) who incurs a "qualifying event" (as defined in Section
4980B of the Code) after the Effective Time.

5.7 _Accrued Vacation_. During the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs, Purchaser shall grant paid vacation days to all Transferred Employees
employed by Purchaser who have accrued any unused vacation days due from
Sellers as of the date Transferred Employees commence employment with
Purchaser. If Transferred Employees do not take unused vacation days as time
off prior to December 31st of such year, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, such vacation shall be forfeited. Beginning the calendar year following
the year in which the Closing Date occurs, Transferred Employees shall be
eligible for vacation in accordance with Purchasers policy, taking into
account service recognized in accordance with Section 5.4, and service earned
while employed with Purchaser.

5.8 _Workers  Compensation Benefits_. All liabilities under state workers
compensation statutes with respect to Sellers Employees through the Effective
Time shall remain liabilities of Sellers.

 

5.9 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to
confer on any entity or individual who is not a party to this Agreement
(including any Sellers Employees) any rights whatsoever.

5.10 _Further Cooperation_. Sellers and Purchaser shall, cooperate in good
faith to effectuate the provisions of this Section 5 and to ensure an orderly
and effective transition of benefits coverage with respect to the Transferred
Employees from the employee benefit plans to the appropriate plans
established by Purchaser on or as promptly as possible after Closing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, Sellers will make available
to Purchaser, in accordance with this Section 5.10, any information
(including current and historic data and files) which Purchaser may reasonably
request which is required or helpful for the continued and lawful operation of
the employee benefits plans or Purchasers employee benefit plans (in
the case of a request from Purchaser). ---|---|---

  ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT |  | PAGE 43 



 





      | (d) | _Indemnification Procedures_. A party entitled to
indemnification hereunder shall herein be referred to as an "Indemnitee." A
party obligated to indemnify an Indemnitee hereunder shall herein be referred
to as an "Indemnitor." 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

_Third Party Claims_. Within ten (10) business days after an Indemnitee
receives notice of any third party claim or the commencement of any action by
any third party which such Indemnitee reasonably believes may give rise to a
claim for indemnification from an Indemnitor hereunder, such Indemnitee shall,
if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an Indemnitor
under Section 7, notify such Indemnitor in writing in reasonable detail of
such claim or action and include with such notice copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) served on or received by the Indemnitee
from such third party. Upon receipt of such notice, the Indemnitor shall be
entitled to participate in such claim or action, to assume the defense thereof
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, and to settle or
compromise such claim or action, provided that such settlement or compromise
shall be effected only with the consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. After notice to the Indemnitee of the
Indemnitors election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the
Indemnitor shall not be liable to the Indemnitee under Section 7 for any legal
or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with
the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, provided
that the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ counsel at the Indemnitees
expense, to represent it if either (x) such claim or action involves remedies
other than monetary damages and such remedies, in the Indemnitees reasonable
judgment, could have a material adverse effect on such Indemnitee or (y) the
Indemnitee may have available to it one or more defenses or counterclaims
which are inconsistent with one or more defenses or counterclaims which may
be alleged by the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor does not elect to assume the
defense of such claim or action within forty five (45) days of the
Indemnitees delivery to notice of such a claim or action, the Indemnitee
shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof. Unless it has been
conclusively determined through a final judicial determination (or settlement
tantamount thereto) that the Indemnitor is not liable to the Indemnitee under
this Section 7.2(d), the Indemnitee shall act reasonably and in accordance
with its good faith business judgment with respect to such defense, and shall
not settle or compromise any such claim or action without the consent of the
Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The
parties hereto agree to render to each other such assistance as may 

---|---|--- ---|---|--- 
  ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT |  | PAGE 44

 reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense
of any such claim or action, including making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any relevant materials or to testify at any proceedings relating to such
claim or action. 

---|--- 



     | (ii) | _Other Claims_. Within ten (10) business days after an
Indemnitee sustains any Damages not involving a third party claim or action
which such Indemnitee reasonably believes may give rise to a claim for
indemnification from an Indemnitor hereunder, such Indemnitee shall deliver
notice of such claim to the Indemnitor, specifying with reasonable detail the
basis on which indemnification is being asserted and the amount of such
Damages. If the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnitee within thirty (30)
calendar days following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnitor
disputes its liability to the Indemnitee under this Section 7, such claim
specified by the Indemnitee in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a
liability of the Indemnitor under this Section 7 and the Indemnitor shall pay
the amount of such claim to the Indemnitee on demand or, in the case of any
notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated,
on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion thereof)
becomes finally determined. If the Indemnitor has timely disputed its
liability with respect to such claim, as provided above, the Indemnitor and
the Indemnitee shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such
dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be
resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction in
accordance with Article 8 of this Agreement.

an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes unless otherwise
required by law. 
---|---|---

---|---|---

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | any failure or breach of covenant or obligation,
